A total of 12 high school students voluntarily participated in this study where data regarding their understanding were measured by means of an identical pen-and-paper test and interviews. Even though none of the students could explain what the Einstein’s version of gravity is in the pre-test, their responses in the post-test indicated that the approach we applied could help them understand the Einstein’s theory of gravity. Not only could they recall what the gravity is, most of them managed to provide related analogy they have learnt to explain their thoughts.

ABSTRACT
The Covid-19 pandemic reached Rio Grande do Sul (RS), highlighting the need for a multidisciplinary and systematic approach, seeking emerging responses. The lack of a national strategy to combat the new coronavirus required the elaboration of an alternative by the local government. The option adopted was a controlled distance model, considering the health system management, aiming at guaranteeing the capacity to attend the sick due to Covid-19 and other diseases, and allowing the functioning of the economic sectors. This article provides an overview of the confirmation of cases of Covid-19 in Rio Grande do Sul, analyzes the evolution of the disease from April to October 2020, and gives a critical commentary on the controlled distance model applied by the state government. Reflections are made on the objectives of such a model, which express an attempt to condition the population’s spatial practices, and on the efficiency of the instrumentalization of social control symbolized by colors indicating the intensity of restrictions.

The very low levels of infant mortality in the developed world correspond to a range of 1𝑎0 quantities. We illustrate the competing effect of falling mortality and reduction in preterm births on 1𝑎0, through two populations with very different levels of premature birth — infants born to non-Hispanic white mothers and to non- Hispanic black mothers in the United States. Through simulation, we further demonstrate that falling mortality reduces 1𝑎0, while a reduction in premature births increases it. We use these observations to motivate the formulation of a new approximation formula for 1𝑎0 in low- mortality contexts, which is a function of both the infant mortality rate and the ratio of infant to under-five mortality.

The United States and Canada are responsible for one-sixth of global greenhouse gas emissions but hold extensive natural ecosystems that store globally-significant above- and below-ground carbon. Canada has initiated a process of protected area network expansion in concert with efforts at reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples, and acknowledged nature-based solutions as a key aspect of climate change mitigation. The US, although not a party to global biodiversity conventions, has recently committed to protecting 30% of its extent by 2030 and achieving the UNFCCC Paris Agreement’s mitigation targets. The opportunities afforded by these dual biodiversity conservation and climate commitments require coordinated national and regional policies to ensure that new protected areas maximize biodiversity-focused adaptation and nature-based mitigation opportunities. We address how global commitments can best inform national policy initiatives which build on existing agency mandates for regional planning and species conservation. Previous analyses of global conservation priorities under climate change have been tenuously linked to policy contexts of individual nations and have lacked information on refugia due to limitations of globally available datasets. Comparison and synthesis of predictions from a range of recently-developed refugia metrics allow such data to inform planning despite substantial uncertainty arising from contrasting model assumptions and inputs. A case study for endangered species planning for old-forest-associated species in the US Pacific Northwest demonstrates how regional planning can be nested hierarchically within national biodiversity-focused adaptation and nature-based mitigation strategies which integrate refugia, connectivity, and ecosystem carbon metrics to holistically evaluate the role of different land designations and where carbon mitigation and protection of biodiversity’s resilience to climate change can be aligned.",TRUE,FALSE,climate adaptation|climate change mitigation|climate refugia|Conservation|Convention on Biological Diversity|nature-based solutions,2020-12-27T18:03:41.275024,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-12-27T18:03:28.900200,FALSE,NA,available,NA,http://adaptwest.databasin.org,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Environmental Policy",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/snk95/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/snk95/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/snk95/citation/,snk95,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/snk95/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/snk95/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/snk95/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fe55fc1e3acd100504ac826/,5fe55fc1e3acd100504ac826,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/snk95/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/snk95/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/snk95/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/snk95/,https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.15645,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/snk95

Perasaan insecure banyak dialami para wanita-wanita muda, dan juga insecure ini kurang lebih saja dengan perasaan tidak percaya diri. Oleh karena itu, para wanita berlomba-lomba untuk merawat wajahnya hingga banyak sekali orang menjual produk-produk kecantikan karena hal tersebut. Insecure berawal dari tren kecantikan yang di sebut “glowing” dan juga “glow up”, karena kebanyakan para influencer, seleb, dan lainnya memperlihatkan wajah yang mulus tanpa jerawat, pori-pori dan tampak bercahaya. Kemudian para wanita mulai iri dengan wajah yang terawat tersebut hingga mulai bertanya-tanya tentang produk apa yang telah digunakan, sampai akhirnya semakin banyak wanita yang memperlihatkan kecantikan wajahnya dan sebagian wanita yang memiliki permasalahan wajah yang sulit sembuh pun merasa insecure atau tidak percaya diri.",TRUE,FALSE,Covid-19|Insecure|Produk Kecantikan,2020-12-27T17:59:41.874232,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-12-27T17:59:32.176035,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76da5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Personality and Social Contexts|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uc735/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uc735/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uc735/citation/,uc735,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uc735/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uc735/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uc735/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fe53a7ce9ccb90049af120c/,5fe53a7ce9ccb90049af120c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uc735/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uc735/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uc735/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/uc735/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/uc735

Diversity, commonality, and politics","The Latino classification is distinct from all other racial or ethnic classifications employed in the United States as it is not based on shared physical appearance or geographical origin, instead Latinos are those who hail from a portion of the territories that once belonged to the Spanish Empire regardless of their ancestry or physical appearance. The diversity within the Latino classification means that it is unclear what is being measured when the Latino classification is used to conduct science. Regardless of the Latino classification's usefulness for science the Latino classification has been defended for its usefulness in helping redress the consequences of racism against Latinos. However, the ultimate cause of this discrimination is that most Latinos have a non‐White appearance making the Latino classification a poor proxy for any effort to address racism. The solution is not to return to the classification system that existed prior to the creation of the Latino classification but to instead adopt more granular classifications employed in Latin America such as Mestizo and Mulatto. This will allow for a more detailed study of discrimination and the redirection of resources to those most in need.",TRUE,FALSE,census|hispanic|latino|latinx|mestizos|Nixon|race|racism,2020-12-27T18:15:00.821084,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-12-27T18:14:49.146005,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Latina/o Sociology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m9j8v/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m9j8v/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m9j8v/citation/,m9j8v,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m9j8v/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m9j8v/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m9j8v/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fe4999b1e6d9700342fb359/,5fe4999b1e6d9700342fb359,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m9j8v/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m9j8v/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m9j8v/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/m9j8v/,https://doi.org/10.1111/soc4.12836,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/m9j8v

Based on online observations, interviews with online fiction writers and readers, and content analysis of selected popular works of online fiction, I argue that online fiction has created survivalist and revenge-themed fantasy worlds that act as a shadow civil sphere. On the one hand, shadow refers to the dark side of the civil sphere wherein people use extremely anti-civil online fictions to reject the empty moral values promoted by the state. On the other hand, in the shadow people are still expressing moral ideals through cynicism. By creating a fantasy world that’s more nasty and brutish than reality, they are expressing their cynicism regarding the society, the social system and the pretense of the public world. However, their cynicism actually articulates their belief in those civil values.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-12-26T18:25:42.197235,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-12-26T18:25:17.742608,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture,TIAN XIAOLI,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6m5yd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6m5yd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6m5yd/citation/,6m5yd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6m5yd/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6m5yd/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6m5yd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fe44754e3acd100314a5001/,5fe44754e3acd100314a5001,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6m5yd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6m5yd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6m5yd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6m5yd/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6m5yd
