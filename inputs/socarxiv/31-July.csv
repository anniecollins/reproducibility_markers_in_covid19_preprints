This evidence can be used to explore the hypothesis that educators are high-performers and functionally elevate their performance under duress to serve the public. The relative importance of teacher performance during the COVID-19 pandemic was examined using scientific synthesis tools.

Familism and Latino/a-White Differences in College Pathways,"Recent research has argued that familism, defined as a cultural preference for privileging family goals over individual goals, may discourage some Latino/a youth from applying to and attending college, particularly if they must leave home (Desmond and Turley 2009). Using data from the Education Longitudinal Study, we find that Latino/a students and parents indeed have stronger preferences than white students and parents for living at home during college. For students, most differences in preferences for proximate colleges are explained by socioeconomic status, academic achievement and high school/regional differences. Moreover, controlling for socioeconomic background and prior achievement explains most racial/ethnic gaps in college application and attendance among high school graduates, suggesting that familism per se is not a significant deterrent to college enrollment above and beyond these more primary factors.

The scarcity of non-verbal cues in digital communication facilitates deceptive mimicry, which undermines the interpersonal trust required for sensitive transactions. Open-source data from Arabic-language jihadi forums between 2006 and 2011 indicate that distrust there was high and direct recruitment rare. General trust also declined over time as policing of the forums increased. As of 2014, forums are still in use, but primarily for low-stake activities such as propaganda-sharing and ideological debate, not recruiting or operational coordination. Confidence in the authenticity of propaganda remained relatively high, due to vetting institutions and hard-to-fake video formats. A modicum of interpersonal trust also remained, thanks to reputation systems and a few relatively reliable signs of trustworthiness involving time expenditure.

In the study of Australian phonologies, static properties have long held the spotlight, with book-length works appearing already several decades ago on segments (Busby 1980) and phonotactics (Hamilton 1996). Dynamic phonology in comparison has never really taken centre stage.1 Short discussions of at most a few pages per phenomenon appear on morphophonological topics in overview works by Evans (1995a), Dixon (1980; 2002) and Baker (2014). These have proven invaluable, but the short format lends itself to the citation of particularly striking or well-known data, and since it lacks space to explore diversity in detail, can contribute to an exaggerated discourse of uniformity in Australian languages, where phenomena are rare, pervasive or absent, but seldom ‘diverse’. To address this, the current chapter presents just two studies. Each is on a topic chosen for its particular interest with respect to Australian languages, and owing to the state of the literature described above, each is (at time of writing) the most in-depth survey of that phenomenon in Australian languages to date, and fills a gap in our knowledge that has persisted for too long. Section 1 covers materials and methods. Section 2 examines lenition, a morphophonological process that is particularly common in Australian languages. Section 3 investigates assimilation, and relates it back to key phonotactic generalisations.

Calls for holding individuals whose actions and omissions contributed to the meltdown accountable have gained traction in a number of countries after the crisis. Yet, individual accountability norms are seemingly absent from the international economic agenda in response to crisis.  In this paper we address this puzzle by exploring the evolution of two major international organisations, the IMF and the FSB, in bringing accountability following financial crises.  Our analysis reveals how these institutions have increasingly incorporated in their toolkit policy recommendations related to the unethical or illegal conduct by government officials of individuals in the financial industry, but these tools were geared almost exclusively towards forward-looking policies designed to deter the reoccurrence of illegal or unethical behavior rather than punishing or scrutinizing past wrongdoing.

In these circumstances the IV estimator is often interpreted as yielding an estimate of a Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE): a marginal change in the outcome for those whose treatment is changed by the variation of the particular instrument in the study.  Our aim is to explain the relationship between the LATE parameter and its IV estimator by using a simple model which is easily accessible to applied researchers, and by relating the model to examples from the demographic literature. A focus of the paper is how additional heterogeneity in the instrument – treatment relationship affects the properties and interpretation of the IV estimator.  We show that if the two kinds of heterogeneity are correlated, then the LATE parameter combines both the underlying treatment effects and the parameters from the instrument – treatment relationship.

Granow et al. (2018) showed that binge-watching is accompanied by both positive as well as negative psychological experiences. Because it is one of the most important studies on the topic, we conducted a direct replication of Granow et al. (2018). We also extended the original study by including additional variables derived from self-determination theory. We conducted an online questionnaire with 668 respondents. Results showed that we could not reproduce the exact model that was reported. We also needed to adapt several of the originally tested measures to achieve satisfactory model fit. After introducing these changes, results showed that we replicated 67 percent of all effects in terms of significance (i.e., originally significant effects were also significant in the replication, and vice versa). When looking at effect size (i.e., originally reported effects fell into the replication’s 95% confidence interval), we replicated 42 percent. Together, our study represents a partial replication of Granow et al. (2018). In our extension, we found two further positive links between binge-watching and well-being: Binge-watching was associated not only with greater autonomy, but also with increased feelings of competence and relatedness.

El objetivo de la presente reflexión es incentivar y motivar a las organizaciones del sistema aeronáutico para que se incluyan a las competencias no técnicas en los aspectos clave de la administración del recurso humano, para esto, El principio de la integralidad contiene la integración de manera articulada de éstas competencias no técnicas en los procesos de selección, formación, promoción y evaluación de los individuos que pertenecen al sistema aeronáutico.
Se ha evidenciado que los procesos de formación básica de personal aeronáutico aún no incluyen a las competencias no técnicas como una herramienta clave del proceso, incluso los programas especiales de gestión del riesgo se han promovido de manera técnica y cognitiva dejando un vacío en la estructura del comportamiento, esto afecta indudablemente el desempeño cuando el personal enfrenta situaciones no deseadas o de riesgo. 
Como conclusión del presente estudio se ha determinado que sin lugar a duda es necesario desarrollar un plan de actualización de los procesos de la administración del factor humano en donde se incluya la integralidad de las competencias como estrategia clave en la adherencia de la cultura de la seguridad operacional y en el proceso de gestión del riesgo aeronáutico. 
La participación sistémica de las organizaciones aeronáuticas en este emprendimiento se hace relevante si consideramos que los comportamientos de los individuos afectan el cumplimiento de los objetivos comunes en materia de la seguridad operacional.

Scholars have found that counts generated via Census-released test data are accurate for aggregate population statistics but introduce considerable error for tabulations of sub-groups. At present, the ramifications of this new approach, and the error it may introduce, remain unclear for rural populations. In this brief, we focus on rural populations and evaluate the ability of the proposed differential privacy data to estimate growth rates from 2000 to 2010 across the rural-urban continuum for the total, non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic or Latino/a, and non-Hispanic American Indian population. We find the method introduces significant error into growth rates at the county level for all groups except the total and non-Hispanic white population. Further, errors increase dramatically as we move from urban to rural. Thus, unless corrected the proposed differential privacy method will introduce significant rural and non-white bias into census tabulations.",TRUE,FALSE,Census|Decennial Counts|Differential Privacy|Population Growth|Rural,2021-06-03T16:13:02.881024,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-03T16:12:22.790325,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Latina/o Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/69mtk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/69mtk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/69mtk/citation/,69mtk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/69mtk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/69mtk/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/69mtk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60b8fdd2cb2a5e032168baec/,60b8fdd2cb2a5e032168baec,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/69mtk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/69mtk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/69mtk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/69mtk/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/69mtk,NA
