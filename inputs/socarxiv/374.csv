The General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) has provided researchers with a vast trove of machine-readable data allowing for highly detailed spatio-temporal modelling of scheduled transit operations.
Yet it is well established that in the real-world schedules are imperfect - vehicles often run late, get bunched, miss transfers, arrive too full for anyone to board, and otherwise behave in predictably unpredictable ways. 
Schedule data alone cannot possibly account for this distinctly stochastic component of much transit service, which to date has been considered separate from accessibility analysis under the umbrella of ``reliability''. 
This dissertation takes the perspective that transit service is reliably unreliable and will continue to be so until humans are taken out of the equation. Detailed observations of actual service can be used to construct more realistic models for estimating travel times and thus accessibility via transit.
		
Chapter 2 introduces a novel method of converting a detailed GPS record of transit fleet locations into a retrospective GTFS package. This backward-looking ""schedule'' format allows the same tools developed for schedule-based GTFS analysis to be applied in Chapter 3 to a more accurate depiction of actual transit accessibility. The findings indicate that models of transit accessibility based on schedule data alone tend to produce substantial overestimates of accessibility and systematic spatial errors by failing to account for normal irregularities in service provision. Chapter 4 points toward a way of better suiting available GTFS analysis tools to actual transit service by addressing the problem of imperfect information in modelled route choice. The travel time implications for a large minority of trips are shown to be substantial. 
		
Transit accessibility research has come a long way in the last decade and has a long way yet to go. Models based on schedule data alone should give way in many cases to models based on service as actually provided, acknowledging that schedules may guide but rarely constrain the transit services that passengers actually use every day.",TRUE,FALSE,access|accessibility|dissertation|General Transit Feed Specification|gtfs|planning|public transport|Toronto|transit|transport|urban planning,2019-05-08T14:11:49.619156,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-08T14:11:09.208961,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d88|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Geographic Information Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,Nate Wessel,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c4yvx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c4yvx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c4yvx/citation/,c4yvx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c4yvx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/cfvk4/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c4yvx/relationships/node/,cfvk4,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c4yvx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cd21a488098e9001657f7d9/,5cd21a488098e9001657f7d9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c4yvx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c4yvx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c4yvx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/c4yvx/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/c4yvx,NA

The existing research to develop inclusive STEM education adopts a deficit approach and fails to address the intersectionality of gender, race and class. By not addressing this intersectionality, research has failed to consider the effects of racial privilege for white women and the unique experiences of each woman of color. In contrast, my research will take an anti- deficit approach and value the intersectionality of each student. The objective of this study is to examine the experiences of WSOC in their secondary STEM education according to the intersection of race, gender and class. This research is also guided by the following questions: (1) What are WSOC’s social and academic experiences of STEM-related courses, and in-class and extracurricular activities? (2) What support systems and barriers do WSOC recognize in their schools pertaining to STEM, if any? (3) How are their experience, support systems and barriers unique yet similar according to their intersectionality? This paper develops the theoretical approach that guides my research. To better understand how WSOC are racialized and gendered in the settler state, I adopt Critical Race Theory (CRT) approach. In the education setting, it describes how schools, as a state funded institute, act as a site of reinforcement of this oppression. I also incorporate post- structualist work on identity and power to refine how WSOC are situated in the STEM education setting.

Using the case of the U.S. civil rights movement, I develop a theory in which protests can shift attitudes and these attitudes can persist. Data from over 150,000 survey respondents provide evidence consistent with the theory. Whites from counties that experienced historical civil rights protests are more likely to identify as Democrats and support affirmative action, and less likely to harbor racial resentment against blacks.

Using an instrumental variables strategy leveraging the exogenous timing of the war, I show that individuals of foreign, European nativity–especially, the Italians and Eastern Europeans–were more likely to assimilate into American society after serving in the U.S. military.

Reassessing Evidence from Sibling and Cousin Correlations,"Sibling and cousin correlations are empirically straightforward: they capture the degree to which siblings' or cousins' outcomes are similar. The meaning of these quantities, however, is complicated. A multitude of theoretical processes can produce any particular set of sibling and cousin correlations. Using multigenerational mobility as a substantive example, I show that sibling and cousin correlations in published research are equally consistent with several theoretical interpretations. While some prior authors have concluded that opportunity must skip parents to directly link the outcomes of grandparents and offspring, I show that this evidence is often consistent with alternative theories of latent transmission (measurement error) or of dynamic transmission (a parent-to-child transmission process that changes over generations). I clarify that point estimates which seem to contradict a given theory may also arise from estimation error. I develop a Bayesian procedure to estimate sibling and cousin correlations and quantify uncertainty about the statistic central to the argument. I conclude by outlining how future research might use sibling and cousin correlations as effective descriptive quantities while remaining cognizant that these quantities could arise from a variety of distinct theoretical processes.",TRUE,FALSE,demography|intergenerational mobility|measurement error|multigenerational mobility|sibling correlations,2019-05-07T18:02:12.052932,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-06T15:22:49.290252,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ueby7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ueby7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ueby7/citation/,ueby7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ueby7/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ueby7/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ueby7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cd03f3a78c993001cd3c61d/,5cd03f3a78c993001cd3c61d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ueby7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ueby7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ueby7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ueby7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ueby7,NA

Uptake of interventions is non-randomly distributed across populations, and such inequality is socially patterned both statically (due to homophily) and dynamically (due to social selection and influence). Social network analysis (SNA) methods, including egocentric, sociocentric, and respondent-driven sampling, provide tools to measure most-at-risk populations, to understand how epidemics spread, and to evaluate intervention take-up. SNA informed designs can improve intervention effectiveness by reaching otherwise inaccessible populations and improve efficiency by maximizing spillovers to at-risk but susceptible individuals through social ties; they thus have the potential to be both more effective and less unequal in their effects than SNA-naïve approaches. While SNA-informed designs are often resource-intensive, they are uniquely able to help reach those most in need of HIV prevention and treatment interventions. Increased collection of social network data during both research and implementation work would provide important information to improve the roll-out of existing studies in the present and to inform the design of more data-efficient, SNA-informed interventions in the future.",TRUE,FALSE,egocentric|HIV|Implementation Science|interventions|respondent driven sampling|Social networks|sociocentric|study design,2019-05-07T17:58:02.936695,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-06T15:21:53.012760,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/apwcy/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/apwcy/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/apwcy/citation/,apwcy,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/apwcy/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/apwcy/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/apwcy/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ccfe92c7788f5001aaafac8/,5ccfe92c7788f5001aaafac8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/apwcy/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/apwcy/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/apwcy/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/apwcy/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/apwcy,NA

In the last decade, the rise of online social media has posed new challenges and opportunities for researchers and modelers wishing to study social influence. In this review article, we trace back the study of social influence to its roots in early diffusionist theory. Then, in order to contextualize the issues faced by modern researchers of social influence, we attempt summarize it's more classic models and explanations. Finally, we shift our focus to the role of the internet, both as a source of new opportunities and of new challenges for researchers interested in studying social influence.",TRUE,FALSE,Agent Based Models|Diffusion|Echo Chambers|Filter Bubbles|Social Influence,2019-05-06T16:00:43.809433,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-06T03:23:21.713460,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e34|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology",Billy Campoli,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8fwn7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8fwn7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8fwn7/citation/,8fwn7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8fwn7/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8fwn7/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8fwn7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ccfa32510339000179d9764/,5ccfa32510339000179d9764,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8fwn7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8fwn7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8fwn7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8fwn7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8fwn7,NA
