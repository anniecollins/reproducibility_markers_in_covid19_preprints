Several investigations showed that drugs become prevalent among schoolers in comparison to cigarettes; for this reason, teens tend to develop street drug expressions commonly known as slang names to ease their access into the very dark and secretive world of drugs and steroids. In this vein, the present research paper pursues to shed light on Algerian teens and their use of drug slang terms. It also provides a thorough overview of the slang created by Algerian youngsters to facilitate the exchange of drug products. In this tight, the researcher made a profound investigation by taking Tlemcen speech community as a case in point. The researcher collected data through a semi-structured questionnaire and an interview. To this end, the results provided an in-depth look at what is behind the backdrop of the drug world. The analysis revealed that there is increasing use of slang terms between teens at secondary schools, especially words for selling and buying drugs.

Due to several differences found between Arabic and English regarding types, meanings and functions of quantifiers, Arabic learners encounter challenges in mastering them properly. Unlike English, Arabic does not make lots of distinctions among the different meanings that each quantifier might bear; using the same quantifier to bear two or several meanings at the same time. Arabic, for instance, does not differentiate between countable and non-countable nouns using the same modifier in contrast to English. According to the Feature Reassembly Hypothesis (Lardiere 2005, 2009; Choi &amp; Lardiere, 2006), second language (L2) speakers must successfully reassemble existing features of their first language (L1) into the L2 feature-based sets in order to accommodate the L2 grammar. The researcher tests the validity of this prediction for the L2 acquisition of English quantifiers, which requires Arabic learners of English to remap semantic concepts of quantity onto new and different morpholexical configurations. Data from 40 L1 Arabic learners of English at different levels of proficiency and 20 native speakers who completed a picture/sentence matching task suggest that only the meanings which require different and new semantics-morphology remapping is difficult.",TRUE,FALSE,Arabic quantifiers|English quantifiers|feature reassembly hypothesis|mapping,2020-06-14T11:06:43.700276,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-14T11:06:03.393040,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jcd84/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jcd84/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jcd84/citation/,jcd84,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jcd84/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jcd84/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jcd84/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ee5bc1244eab500a3525e97/,5ee5bc1244eab500a3525e97,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jcd84/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jcd84/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jcd84/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jcd84/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol11no1.25,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jcd84

However, British and Iraqi MPs perform differently at the blame avoidance stage in that British MPs employ politeness as their main defense strategy, whereas Iraqi MPs exploit impoliteness. Besides, British and Iraqi MPs at the blame stage tend to violate the maxim of quality by fabricating their statements. At the blame avoidance stage, the maxim of relevance was the most violated one through the strategy of evasion.

For collecting data about how the teachers view their roles within and beyond the classrooms, two campuses of King Khalid University were selected, and the research methods involved the online survey of the teachers and the interviews of the focus group. The study shows that a cooperative working environment, crystal clear organizations' policies, stimulating carrier paths, and professional recognition motivate the teachers to play their roles on a broader scale.

However, old language teaching methods, mainly, grammar-translation and audio-lingual, are still prevalent in EFL contexts. One of the reasons behind EFL teachers’ hesitance to shift entirely to communicative language teaching (CLT) is the absence of clear guidance, including examples for classroom activities appropriate for this approach. Thus, the aim of this study is, first, to bridge this gap by suggesting digital storytelling as a classroom activity that is well-aligned with the principles of the communicative language approach. Second, to assess the effectiveness of digital storytelling activity on improving some linguistic aspects of students’ communicative competence. To this end, the study incorporated a case study design using multiple qualitative methods such as participant observation, semi-structured interviews and analysis of participants’ scripts and recordings to measure the improvement, if any. Participants were a class of 32 10th graders who collaboratively created five digital stories over 12 weeks. Results showed students’ favourable views to digital storytelling activity, particularly the ample opportunities it creates for communication inside the classroom.

The English language has changed over time. This research investigates the most appropriate and useful teaching methods for teaching General English (GE) and English for Specific Purposes (ESP) in the Saudi context. This study is an attempt to share experienced English as a foreign language (EFL)/ English as a second language (ESL) teachers' methodology for teaching EG and ESP to Saudi EFL learners. The paper aims to answer the following questions: 1) What are the conventional methods for teaching GE and ESP?; 2) What are the English teachers' perceptions of these effective teaching pedagogies?; 3) What are the practical measures to improve student efficiency in learning English? The sample of the study was n = 63 English teachers randomly selected at different universities in Saudi Arabia. For collecting the quantitative data, 63 native and non-native experienced English teachers were requested to fill in a semi-structured questionnaire. The results show that 73% of the English language teachers prefer to use the Communicative Language Teaching (CLT) along with other teaching methods. The findings shed light on some highly useful teaching methods that have proved successful in EG and ESP classes. The researchers expect the study will be significant in contributing to the most appropriate methods used in Saudi Arabia for language teachers. Hopefully, teachers wishing to teach in the future will have an insight into the teaching methods that fulfill the requirements of the students.",TRUE,FALSE,English for Specific Purposes|English language teaching methods|General English|learner needs|teachers' perceptions,2020-06-14T11:08:21.774922,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-14T11:08:11.464024,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d2x6e/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d2x6e/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d2x6e/citation/,d2x6e,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d2x6e/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d2x6e/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d2x6e/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ee5b1f944eab5009c526bda/,5ee5b1f944eab5009c526bda,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d2x6e/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d2x6e/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d2x6e/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/d2x6e/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol11no1.19,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/d2x6e

This research investigates, from a sociolinguistic perspective, the speech acts of compliments and compliment responses as realized by eighty Saudi students who study English as a Foreign Language (EFL). It aims to identify the semantic and structural formulas used by the participants to express compliments and to respond to compliments. The study also examines the roles of the topic of conversation and the participants’ first language in the realisation of compliments. Furthermore, the study investigates gender differences with regard to the use of compliments and compliment responses. A discourse completion test (DCT) consisting of twelve situations was used to collect data from the participants. The analysis of the responses found that the dominant form of compliments used was unbound semantic formulas that were not influenced by the social relationship between the participants. Topics that are socially delicate result in the use of more implicit compliments than explicit compliments. The religious norms require politeness in the interactions between people, and this is reflected in the prevalence of implicit compliments. There is a wide range of compliments used with no fixed pattern of usage. Compliments tend to be given using adjectives rather than verbs. Gender did not appear to affect the nature of usage of compliments and responses. The research suggests that the cultural influences of the English language and western culture may be influencing how young Saudis use compliments.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-06-14T11:08:41.767614,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-14T11:08:23.192053,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/km38q/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/km38q/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/km38q/citation/,km38q,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/km38q/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/km38q/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/km38q/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ee5b14336a16d00a4e91566/,5ee5b14336a16d00a4e91566,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/km38q/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/km38q/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/km38q/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/km38q/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol11no1.18,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/km38q
