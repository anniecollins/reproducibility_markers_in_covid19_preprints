Associated changes in pre-Columbian human population size and density, however, are poorly known and often estimated on the basis of unreliable assumptions and guesswork. Drawing on recent developments in the aggregate analysis of large radiocarbon databases, here we present and examine different proxies for relative population change between 1050 BC and AD 1500 within this broad region. By using a robust model-testing approach, our analyses document that the growth of pre-Columbian human population over the 1,700 years prior to European colonisation adheres to a logistic model of demographic growth. This suggests that, at an aggregate level, these pre-Columbian populations had likely reached carrying capacity (however high) before the onset of European colonisation. Our analyses also demonstrate that this aggregate scenario shows considerable variability when projected geographically, which bears on our overall understanding of the resilience of past human food procurement strategies. Lastly, our results provide important insights into pre-Columbian demographic trends and offer novel perspectives on demic expansions, language diversification, and subsistence intensification in the Amazonian biome during the late Holocene.",TRUE,FALSE,Amazonian Archaeology|Amazonian biome|Late Holocene|Palaeodemography|Summed Calibrated Probability Distributions,2020-05-05T02:21:23.204285,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-05T02:21:12.773090,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Nature and Society Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Archaeological Anthropology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ws8et/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ws8et/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ws8et/citation/,ws8et,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ws8et/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ws8et/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ws8et/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5eb0b9e969d3e1012cdecf7a/,5eb0b9e969d3e1012cdecf7a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ws8et/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ws8et/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ws8et/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ws8et/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ws8et,NA

Developing and delivering a vaccine may be the most likely way to end the pandemic. If it were possible to shorten this development time by weeks or months, this may have a significant effect on reducing deaths. Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials could take less long to conduct if they used human challenge methods – that is, deliberately infecting participants with COVID-19 following inoculation.

This article analyses arguments for and against such methods and provides suggested broad guidelines for regulators, researchers and ethics committees when considering these matters. It concludes that it may be possible to maintain current ethical standards yet still permit human challenge trials in a context where delay is critical.

The model involves necessarily infinity even in any finitely dimensional subspace of the complex Hilbert space being due to the complex basis. Furthermore, infinity is what unifies duality and opposition, universality and openness, completeness and incompleteness in it. The deduced core of quantum complementarity in terms of infinity, duality and opposition allows of resolving a series of various problems in different branches of philosophy: the common structure of incompleteness in Gödel’s (1931) theorems and Enstein, Podolsky, and Rosen’s argument (1935); infinity as both complete and incomplete; grounding and self-grounding, metaphor and representation between language and reality, choice and information, the totality and an observer, the basic idea of philosophical phenomenology.

Analyzing anti-Christian violence in Egypt, we identify three types of event – beatings, burnings, and bombings. This typology distinguishes between the target of the attack and the level of violence. Beatings (unarmed attacks targeting individuals) are more likely where Christians are numerous, during economic downturns, and are patterned by religious calendars. Burnings (unarmed attacks targeting property) follow a political logic, occurring where Islamists are mobilizing, and following crackdowns. Beatings and burnings are more prevalent where the state’s coercive capacity is diminished.

Its viewpoint suggests that the crucial link of time and its course is omitted in understanding the problem. The common interpretation underlain by the history of quantum mechanics sees discreteness only on the Plank scale, which is transformed into continuity and even smoothness on the macroscopic scale. That approach is fraught with a series of seeming paradoxes. It suggests that the present mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics is only partly relevant to its problem, which is ostensibly known. The paper accepts just the opposite: The mathematical solution is absolute relevant and serves as an axiomatic base, from which the real and yet hidden problem is deduced. Wave-particle duality, Hilbert space, both probabilistic and many-worlds interpretations of quantum mechanics, quantum information, and the Schrödinger equation are included in that base.

The adequate generalization of ‘measurement’ is discussed to involve the discrepancy, due to the fundamental Planck constant, between any quantum coherent state and its statistical representation as a statistical ensemble after measurement. Quantum invariance designates the relation of any quantum coherent state to the corresponding statistical ensemble of measured results.
A set-theory corollary is the curious invariance to the axiom of choice: Any coherent state excludes any well-ordering and thus excludes also the axiom of choice. However the above equivalence requires it to be equated to a well-ordered set after measurement and thus requires the axiom of choice for it to be able to be obtained.
Quantum invariance underlies quantum information and reveals it as the relation of an unordered quantum “much” (i.e. a coherent state) and a well-ordered “many” of the measured results (i.e. a statistical ensemble). It opens up to a new horizon, in which all physical processes and phenomena can be interpreted as quantum computations realizing relevant operations and algorithms on quantum information. All phenomena of entanglement can be described in terms of the so defined quantum information. Quantum invariance elucidates the link between general relativity and quantum mechanics and thus, the problem of quantum gravity.
The nonlocality of quantum information unifies the exact position of any space-time point of a smooth trajectory and the common possibility of all space-time points due to a quantum leap. This is deduced from quantum invariance.

Whilst the majority of cases in most states around the world have fitted an older age profile, our analysis shows that positive cases in Hong Kong have been concentrated amongst younger age groups, with the largest incidence of cases reported in the 15-24 age group.  This is despite the population’s rapidly ageing structure and extremely high levels of population density. Using detailed case data from Hong Kong’s Centre for Health Department and Immigration Department, we analyze the sex and age distribution of the confirmed cases along with their recent travel histories and immigration flows for the period January to April, 2020. Our analysis highlights Hong Kong’s high proportion of imported cases and large overseas student population in developing COVID-19 hotspot areas such as the United Kingdom. Combined with targeted and aggressive early policy measures taken to contain the virus, these factors may have contributed to the uniquely younger age structure of COVID-19 cases in the city. Consequently, this young profile of confirmed cases may have prevented fatalities in the city-state.",TRUE,FALSE,age structure|COVID-19|Hong Kong|housing|migrants|population,2020-05-04T17:58:00.153345,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-04T16:23:22.143376,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5zuv7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5zuv7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5zuv7/citation/,5zuv7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5zuv7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5zuv7/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5zuv7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5eaf91b50ffc0500d36fe1d1/,5eaf91b50ffc0500d36fe1d1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5zuv7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5zuv7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5zuv7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5zuv7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5zuv7,NA

This shift raises the question as to whether medical research has given proper attention to the diseases imposing the greatest burden on society. Therefore, with the aim of identifying correlations between research funding priorities and public demand in health, we examine grants issued by the major medical research funding bodies of China and the UK during the decade 2006-2017 and compare the focus of their funded projects with the diseases that carry the highest burden of death, risk, or loss of health. The results indicate that the funding decisions of both nations do correspond to the illnesses with the highest health impact on their citizens. For both regions, the greatest health concerns surround non-communicable diseases, and neoplasms and cardiovascular disease in particular. In China, national health priorities have remained focused on these illnesses for the benefit of its own population, whereas the UK has funded a wider variety of research, extending to projects with impacts outside its borders to some developing countries. Additionally, despite an increased incidence of mental illness and HIV/AIDs in China, there is evidence that less priority has been given to these conditions. Both of these health areas seem to require more attention from China’s national funding agencies and the society in general. Methodologically, this study can serve as an example of how to conduct analyses related to public health issues by combining informetric methods and data with data and tools from other fields, thereby inspiring other scientometrics studies.",TRUE,FALSE,Burden of Disease|Data Visualization|Funding|MRC|NSFC,2020-05-04T17:58:00.257014,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-04T16:20:36.052139,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Library and Information Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ckpf8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ckpf8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ckpf8/citation/,ckpf8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ckpf8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ckpf8/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ckpf8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5eaf68c269d3e100a9def1bb/,5eaf68c269d3e100a9def1bb,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ckpf8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ckpf8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ckpf8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ckpf8/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ckpf8,NA

İstatistik alanında birçok yöntem, veri setleri ile ilgili olarak bir takım ön varsayımları gerektirmektedir. Bazı makine öğrenme algoritmalarında sağlanması gereken ön koşullar bulunmamaktadır Bu durum ise bir taraftan veri setlerinin içindeki yapılara bağımlığı azaltırken, diğer taraftan bu algoritmaların birçok alanda rahatlıkla kullanılabilmesine olanak vermektedir.  Bu özelliklerinden ötürü makine öğrenme algoritmaları, mühendislik, tıp, kimya gibi bilimler yanında sosyal bilimlerde de önemli bir yer bulmuştur. Bu çalışmada, en sık kullanılan algoritmalardan kNN, Naive Bayes ve karar ağacı makine öğrenme algoritmaları, kullanıldığı alanlar ve özellikleri bakımından ele alınmıştır.
