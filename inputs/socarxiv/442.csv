317 tenth and eleventh grade students (163 Arab-Palestinian students including 93 girls and 70 boys; and 154 Jewish students including 70 girls and 84 boys) participated in the study. The research was conducted in two state Arab-Palestinian schools, one state secular-Jewish school, and one state religious-Jewish school.
The research employed a series of questionnaires. First, a background questionnaire was used to collect basic data about the students; a second questionnaire assessed the nationalistic and religious socialization of the Jewish teenagers and the nationalistic, religious, and ethnic socialization of the Arab-Palestinian adolescents; a third questionnaire assessed the salience of national and religious identity among the Jewish participants, and the salience of national, religious, and ethnic identity among the Arab-Palestinian participants; a fourth questionnaire examined indices of psychological resilience, namely self-esteem, self-efficacy, and the sense of well-being of the Arab-Palestinian and Jewish students. 
The research findings indicate differences between the socialization processes experienced by the Arab-Palestinian students and those experienced by the Jewish students. The nationalistic socialization experienced by the Jewish adolescents was stronger than that experienced by the Arab-Palestinian adolescents, while the Arab-Palestinian adolescents experienced stronger religious socialization than that experienced by the Jewish adolescents. In addition, the level of religious identity was higher among the Arab-Palestinian participants than among the Jewish participants. On the other hand, there were no significant differences between the two groups regarding salience of national identity. The findings did not indicate differences between the two groups with regard to self-esteem and well-being. However, the self-efficacy of the Arab-Palestinian students was found to be higher than that of the Jewish students.",TRUE,FALSE,identity|psychological resilience|socialization,2018-12-03T01:17:20.909101,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-12-03T01:17:07.020290,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d6f|Education|Educational Psychology,School of Education|Bar-Ilan University,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bx3c9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bx3c9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bx3c9/citation/,bx3c9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bx3c9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/jtcge/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bx3c9/relationships/node/,jtcge,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bx3c9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c032f030d776a001768d2f5/,5c032f030d776a001768d2f5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bx3c9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bx3c9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bx3c9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bx3c9/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bx3c9,NA

The researcher brought together ten categories of loan words (in three languages, Malay, Arabic and English).

By querying festival-goers, we hope to capture acute responses to rapidly introduced surveillance from one year to another. In contrast to urban spaces, where surveillance and security measures are gradually (often unnoticeably) introduced (or increased), a change from one year to the next at a festival is very obvious and usually part of the festival marketing. Specifically, we asked participants for their observations on surveillance and security measures, if those change over time, if safety concerns are addressed, and if their behavior changes. We find that festival-goers are sensitive to surveillance, with the majority of our sample reporting noticing it and those that attend more festivals observing it more. Despite that positive correlation, we did not see a bias in responses in regular festival-goers to questions about surveillance. We notice three major trends across the survey: negative crowd behavior is the most pressing issue, crowd-sourced safety measures are most valued, behavior is not altered by concerns about safety but is slightly altered in the presence of surveillance. We notice three major gender-based trends: males are less likely to report being affected by concerns or surveillance, non-binary tend to have different views than male/female respondents, females have the most concerns about safety and surveillance. Ultimately, these data uncover important issues about what makes us feel unsafe and how that varies between groups. There is significant divergence across demographics on primary safety issues. Thus, policing measures taken in everyday life have a differential negative, neutral, or positive effect depending on the member of society experiencing them. The primary limitations of our study are that the non-binary and queer subsamples are small and we did not collect ethnicity data.",TRUE,FALSE,festivals|health|liminality|policing|security|stress|surveillance|well-being,2018-11-30T22:19:01.155194,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-11-30T22:18:49.363551,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df7|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Other Anthropology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yx6nk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yx6nk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yx6nk/citation/,yx6nk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yx6nk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/um7gs/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yx6nk/relationships/node/,um7gs,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yx6nk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c014e15022ce9001a14932f/,5c014e15022ce9001a14932f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yx6nk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yx6nk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yx6nk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/yx6nk/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/yx6nk,NA

The relationship of cultural ecosystem services (CES) with biodiversity is unclear because CES requires subjective evaluations that are difficult to quantify. Toponyms, the places name, reflect human assessment of the natural environment components, such as species composition, that may be reflexed in the place designation. Therefore, regions with greater biodiversity (e.g. species richness) might be expected to exhibit a greater proportion of toponyms related to biotic elements that places with lower biodiversity. We assessed this prediction using the meaning of 346 municipalities in Chile. Specifically, we analyzed the relationship between species richness and the proportion of toponyms that reference biotic elements at two spatial scales: coarse-grained (regions) and fine-grained (municipalities) scales. Toponyms were categorized according to language origin as being either native (non-Spanish, mainly from Mapuche and Quechua people) or non-native (Spanish). At the coarse-grained scale, we found a positive correlation between species richness and the proportion of toponyms associated with biotic elements (e.g. species names). This relation was maintained when only native language toponyms were considered. At the fine-grained scale, only toponyms with native origin showed a marginal relationship between species richness and the probability that toponyms carry a meaning related to biotic elements. We observed that biodiversity is reflected in the name of places, reinforcing the cultural importance of biodiversity, especially among native people. We propose that toponyms could be incorporated into models used to measure the relative importance of Cultural Ecosystem Services.",TRUE,FALSE,biodiversity|conservation-decission making|Global Biodiveristy Information Facility|human well-being|natural resources,2018-11-29T20:28:20.943130,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-11-29T20:28:08.687693,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Animal Studies,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/34j97/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/34j97/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/34j97/citation/,34j97,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/34j97/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/a3qr2/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/34j97/relationships/node/,a3qr2,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/34j97/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c002f24aeafc8001788557a/,5c002f24aeafc8001788557a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/34j97/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/34j97/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/34j97/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/34j97/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/34j97,NA

An increase in the number of childless people has been observed throughout Europe, North America, and Japan. Accompanying this trend, the mean age at first childbirth has increased. However, whether the phenomenon of remaining childless or that of postponing first childbirth is the main contributor has not been clearly investigated. The aim of this study is to quantify those effects using a decomposition method. We employ the classical life table method to measure changes in first childbirth behavior. Life expectancy is normally used in mortality research to represent the average number of years people live. In childlessness (first childbirth) research, life expectancy signifies the expected number of years without children, as the event of focus is first childbirth. Thus, we define the expected years without children as age 15 to age 50 (EYWC) using the Coale-McNeil model. To avoid the problems of truncation and censoring, only completed cohort fertility data of eight selected countries from the Human Fertility Database are examined. EYWC is decomposed into three factors: remaining childless, postponing first childbirth, and expansion of the standard deviation of mean age at first childbirth. Results of the decomposition show that postponement is mainly occurred in North America and Northern European countries. Contrarily, remaining childless is observed as the main contributor in Japan and Portugal.",TRUE,FALSE,childlessness|Coale-McNeil model|decomposition method|life expectancy|postpone first birth,2018-11-29T20:20:06.287355,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-11-29T20:19:37.054413,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hy98w/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hy98w/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hy98w/citation/,hy98w,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hy98w/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/hce2u/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hy98w/relationships/node/,hce2u,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hy98w/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bfe4c2a354448001762d7a3/,5bfe4c2a354448001762d7a3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hy98w/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hy98w/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hy98w/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hy98w/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hy98w,NA

Since 1990, the U.S. Department of Defense has transferred excess military equipment to domestic law enforcement agencies via the federal 1033 program. This article examines transfers of mine-resistant ambush-protected vehicles or MRAPs. Designed to withstand explosive blasts during U.S. military occupations in Iraq and Afghanistan, surplus MRAPs have been shipped to more than 800 domestic law enforcement agencies. This article uses national data on law enforcement agencies and on 1033 program transfers to analyze the pattern of MRAP distribution. The results show that MRAPs are disproportionately acquired by agencies that have warrior tendencies and rely on asset forfeiture to generate revenue.

When tracing the life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of traded products, for example for border carbon adjustments, such emissions are counted at each border crossing. The prevalence and dynamics of this phenomenon have been poorly understood. This paper shows that GHG emissions associated with the production of imports used for producing exports have risen rapidly from 1995, peaking in 2012 and declining slightly to 2016. They now constitute a total of 4.4 PgCO2equ. or 10% of global emissions. The most important exported products in terms of emissions associated with imported inputs are chemicals, vehicles, machinery, and information and communications technology (ICT). Crude petroleum, iron and steel, chemicals, and ICT components are the imported products being used for this export production. A driver analysis indicates that in industrialized countries, the declining domestic value added in exports and increasing share of exports in GDP have contributed most to this development, while in emerging economies, the growth of GDP itself has been an important driving factor, while declines in the energy intensity of export production have provided a weak counterbalance. The importance of transiting carbon raises questions of how climate policies affect industrial competitiveness and how border tax adjustment would account for such emissions.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-11-29T20:16:21.148607,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-11-29T20:16:04.397657,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Nature and Society Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcc|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|International Economics,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zb3rh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zb3rh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zb3rh/citation/,zb3rh,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zb3rh/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/rsdch/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zb3rh/relationships/node/,rsdch,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zb3rh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bfd80e493731d0018323289/,5bfd80e493731d0018323289,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zb3rh/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zb3rh/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zb3rh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zb3rh/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zb3rh,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2019.104651

In offline social network sampling, for practical considerations, researchers sometimes build in a cap on the number of social ties any respondent may claim. It is commonly known in the literature that using a cap on the degrees begets methodologically undesirable features because it discards information about the network connections. In this paper, we consider a mathematical model of this sampling procedure and seek analytical solutions to recover some of the lost information about the underlying network. We obtain closed-form expressions for several network statistics, including the first and second moments of the degree distribution, network density, number of triangles, and clustering. We corroborate the accuracy of these estimators via simulated and empirical network data. Our contribution highlights notable room for improvement in the analysis of some existing social network data sets.",TRUE,FALSE,Ego Network|Network Sampling|Social Network Analysis|Social Networks,2018-11-29T19:50:22.850729,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-11-29T19:50:02.586059,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mathematical Sociology,Babak Fotouhi,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kez8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kez8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kez8/citation/,5kez8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kez8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/k24du/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kez8/relationships/node/,k24du,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kez8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bfd68a1c7e8ba0018dfc38c/,5bfd68a1c7e8ba0018dfc38c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kez8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kez8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kez8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5kez8/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5kez8,NA
