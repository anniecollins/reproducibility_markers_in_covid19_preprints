The Consolidated Text of ACTA released in October 2010, following the final round of negotiations in Japan, contains no provision mandating the adoption of graduated response. Such regimes are tacitly endorsed in the agreement, however, through language in the preamble and the digital environment provisions concerning the promotion of greater cooperation between rights owners and service providers. Moreover, opponents of graduated response should be wary of the fact that public law mechanisms - be they domestic or international - are not the only means by which graduated response can effectively become the law for Internet users. The United States and Ireland provide examples of the trend toward private ordering in the project of online copyright enforcement.

Writing about the growth and governance of the Internet, David Post observed that ""scaling problems - the problems that arise solely as a consequence of increasing size or increasing numbers - can be profound, and profoundly difficult to solve."" Both the Internet's designers and the designers of P2P networks solved difficult problems of scale in their effort to revolutionize the distribution of information goods. In doing so, however, they created a problem of scale in the form of ""massive infringement."" How to approach solving that problem of scale is the subject of this article.

Part I traces the evolution of peer-to-peer (P2P) networks from Napster to BitTorrent, with a focus on the relative scalability of successive architectures. Part II takes up the difficult question of the scale of P2P infringement and its harms, examining the strategic number-crunching that underlies industry data on piracy, the government's credulous acceptance of that data, and the risk of letting industry hyperbole drive copyright policy and law enforcement priorities. Part III evaluates the efficacy of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) as a policy mechanism for scaling up online copyright enforcement. I argue in Part III that the DMCA has proven to be remarkably scalable for enforcing copyrights in hosted content but has altogether failed to scale in the context of P2P file sharing, leading to the dysfunctional workaround of mass John Doe litigation. Part IV weighs the costs and benefits of more scalable alternatives to mass litigation, including a potential amendment of the DMCA's pre-litigation subpoena provision and a pair of administrative dispute resolution systems - one hypothetical, the other real - for streamlining adjudication of P2P infringement claims.

It explores integrated thinking as a cultural control and analyses how it operates.

Methodology: To do so we conduct a case study of bankmecu, a small Australian bank, which is participating in the IIRC's <IR> Pilot Programme Business Network and which issued its first integrated report in 2012. Using semi-structured interviews we examine whether integrated thinking lives up to the rhetoric espoused by the IIRC.

Findings: In bankmecu's case we find that a pre-existing responsible banking culture already in place is a stronger cultural control, alongside personnel, results and action controls. The implication for the IIRC is that integrated thinking appears to be a utopian ideal, clashing with the existing organisational culture rather than driving a new organisational culture.

Practical implications: Additionally, if integrated thinking is to prevail it may become a source of inertia rather than change because it advocates that an entire workforce should think the same. We also question if breaking down silos, as advocated by integrated thinking, is necessary across all organisational functions, especially concerning material organisational risks and reputation, because these silos foster independent thinking.

Policy implications: The problem with the rhetorical arguments proposed by the IIRC is that they aim at a one size fits all approach. Not every organisation has a disconnection between strategy, governance, past performance and future prospects, nor do they all have disconnected departments that need reconnecting. Therefore, a fundamental problem with <IR> is that the rhetoric argues ""why"" companies need <IR>, not ""how"" to implement <IR>, and especially not ""how"" to operationalize integrated thinking.

Originality: The paper is a must read because of the growing debate on the benefits of Integrated Reporting by examining and critiquing early adopter's practice alongside the IIRC's rhetoric.

the individual pursuit of religious knowledge and the conscious assent to

increased interest in and concern with the intellectual legacies of Islam
on the part of ordinary Muslims, most of whom are living through the
postcolonial predicament of establishing the foundations of local political
order on the basis of structures of governance whose genealogy extends to
the European Enlightenment as well as to colonial legal regimes, local
practices, and even older imperial histories. Accordingly, the question of
what “Islamic civilization” has been or could be has gained political
urgency for many Muslim intellectuals since the formal independence of
Muslim-majority nation-states. The Center of Civilization for the
Development of Islamic Thought is a Beirut-based Shi’a Islamist publishing
house which has entered into this debate by putting forth a new view of
Islamic Civilization as a global, pan-Islamic endeavor by Muslim
intellectuals to facilitate interconfessional intellectual exchange. Led by
a reformist Lebanese cleric of Iranian heritage, Shaykh Yahya Mirzaei, the
Center’s employees hope their publishing will spur such intellectual

of the theory he builds; his declared cultural enemies are Western
modernity and science—more broadly, any ""mononaturalist"" episteme which
posits a shared, objectively knowable world. In opposition to these, he
advances a theory of ""perspectivism"" and ""multinaturalism"" which is
allegedly founded in part on Amerindian ""cosmophilosophy."" It bears
repeating, however, that the structural necessity of regional ontologies as
an inevitable outgrowth of the indeterminate trajectories of human
collectivities removed from each other at various degrees of distance does
not preclude at all an anthropology whose purpose is to build a universal
human understanding of culture and social life. This review was written
because the alternative, which has been gaining extraordinary appeal within
the discipline, is a-trajective—it leads to listing, without compass, in a

skilled in order to facilitate the healing of patients? To answer this
question, this paper takes as its case study the clinical practice of
George Atwood, the phenomenological psychoanalyst whose book, *The Abyss of
Madness*, describes his work with patients embroiled in struggles with the
most serious psychological disorders. Atwood’s method is fundamentally
emancipatory in that it seeks to help the patient liberate himself from
psychological bondage to and enmeshment within the traumatic experiences
and oppressive social bonds that have shaped his excruciating experiential
world. The path toward this emancipation can only be based in truth, and as
such, Atwood’s method is predicated on the continual exercise of courage in
service of “the inner truth of a life."" The dedication to practice such
courage through the often-overwhelming encounter with the “blood” that,
according to Atwood, characterizes every healing analysis is born of what
can only be called deep love. In this context, love names a set of profound
inner resources the therapist brings to his own comportment and conduct,
and by extension and implication the overall trajectory of the patient’s
life. This paper explores several specific analytic practices through which
the love of the analyst meets and is co-translated into the subjective
experience of the patient, enabling him through embodied presence, example,
and guidance to re-structure the world of his experience in ways that are
more open, more life-giving, and ultimately more loving to self and other.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,diagnosis|george atwood|method|phenomenological psychoanalysis|Preprint|psychoanalysis|psychotherapy|self psychology|socarxiv|symptomatology|technique,2018-07-02T10:52:03.872242,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-17T05:32:05.688000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r3d52/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r3d52/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r3d52/citation/,r3d52,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r3d52/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/bfjkm/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r3d52/relationships/node/,bfjkm,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r3d52/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/578b18579ad5a101f8f5c504/,578b18579ad5a101f8f5c504,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r3d52/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r3d52/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r3d52/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/r3d52/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/r3d52

Several commentators, drawing on an analogy to computer software protection, have suggested copyright law as an alternative method of protecting recombinant DNA innovation. This article reviews these arguments in light of recent court decisions and scholarly commentary concerning copyright of computer software.  The article argues that copyright law is not sacrosanct, but rather represents a particular scope of proprietary interests that may be used to accommodate the needs of new technologies such as biotechnology. The article asserts, however, that the decision to apply copyright protection to such a technology should be based on policy rather than on analogy. The article reviews the basic characteristics of both the science of molecular biology and of the biotechnology industry, and, by contrasting these characteristics to those of the software industry, concludes that, as a matter of policy, copyright is not the most appropriate form of intellectual property protection for biotechnology.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:53:44.207529,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-17T03:17:35.421000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v28w6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v28w6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v28w6/citation/,v28w6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v28w6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ed69m/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v28w6/relationships/node/,ed69m,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v28w6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/578af8d2594d9001f6859f44/,578af8d2594d9001f6859f44,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v28w6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v28w6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v28w6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/v28w6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/v28w6

Social psychology has been at the heart of this crisis, but the lessons learned are relevant for other fields. We discuss three examples of replication challenges and some proposed solutions, and then consider the applicability of these ideas to clinical neuropsychology. In addition to procedural developments such as preregistration and open data and criticism, we recommend that data be collected and analyzed with more recognition that each new study is a part of a learning process. The goal of improving neuropsychological assessment, care, and cure is too important to not take good scientific practice seriously.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:48:29.319918,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-17T03:00:58.983000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cp8fz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cp8fz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cp8fz/citation/,cp8fz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cp8fz/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/8kmn7/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cp8fz/relationships/node/,8kmn7,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cp8fz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/578af4ec6c613b01f3347cd7/,578af4ec6c613b01f3347cd7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cp8fz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cp8fz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cp8fz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cp8fz/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cp8fz

We test the theory that Trump’s rise has irrationally changed the behavior of one group of people: elite bridge players, whom we assume are otherwise completely typical. We examine the hands played in one of the premier North American bridge events, the Vanderbilt Knockout Tournament, in 1999 and 2015. We find that players had significantly higher probabilities of making No Trump contracts in the 2015 period compared with the earlier periods. We conclude that in the latter period, defending players are subtly deranged by the prospect of Trump and play their hands worse. By contrast, a 2015 European tournament shows no significant difference with the earlier 1999 tournament. This strengthens our conclusion.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:55:04.548774,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-17T02:59:32.320000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yun8m/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yun8m/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yun8m/citation/,yun8m,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yun8m/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/gam8m/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yun8m/relationships/node/,gam8m,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yun8m/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/578af4999ad5a101f8f5c4fc/,578af4999ad5a101f8f5c4fc,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yun8m/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yun8m/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yun8m/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/yun8m/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/yun8m
