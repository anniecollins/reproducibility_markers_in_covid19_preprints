Synthetic biology is one such technology with potential applications across a wide range of sectors with promised sustainability benefits. Over the past decade, the field in the UK has been subject to active policy intervention and support. This article explores the role played by the sustainability agenda in policy debates and the policy mix in support of this emerging field in the UK. Through an exploratory case study approach, I describe the processes through which synthetic biology came to be the subject of policy intervention where wider sustainability goals were situated as subsidiary to the commercialisation agenda. Analysis of the policy mix reveals how this has fed through into a supply-side bias with limited consideration given to actively create or stimulate demand for sustainable synthetic biology applications. These features, combined with limited capacity for anticipation and monitoring, are likely to limit the capacity of the field to drive socio-technical transformation due to a lack of attention to policy coordination, reflexivity, and directionality.",TRUE,FALSE,emerging technology|policy mix|sustainability transitions|synthetic biology|transformational innovation policy,2021-05-23T18:31:01.081360,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-23T18:30:37.797935,TRUE,"Nicholas E.

There is a tension about the nature and scope of participation in citizen science, with the majority of projects being scientific authority-driven crowdsourcing approaches, allowing individuals to perform only narrowly defined microtasks. On the other side of the spectrum, there is peer production: A decentralized way of production that relies on self-organizing communities of individuals, known for example from open source software or Wikipedia.
In this article, we inspect three online citizen science platforms - iNaturalist, Public Lab and Zooniverse - from a peer production perspective. We introduce a working model of peer production ecosystems that we apply to perform qualitative analyses of the projects’ online platforms. Our results show that peer production is partly already practiced in citizen science today and we provide concrete examples of features. The amount of peer production elements vary strongly between the case studies, relative to orientation of the projects as a support for professional researchers or for community activism. We argue for the potential of peer production approaches for more inclusive and democratic citizen science and aim to orient readers on why and how they might put peer production elements into practice in their own citizen science projects.",TRUE,FALSE,citizen science|knowledge production|participatory research|peer production|user experience|web design,2021-05-23T18:30:21.078688,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-23T18:30:04.460563,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rw58y/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rw58y/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rw58y/citation/,rw58y,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rw58y/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/m89vh/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rw58y/relationships/node/,m89vh,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rw58y/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60a7ac3ca480c6008f0d1702/,60a7ac3ca480c6008f0d1702,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rw58y/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rw58y/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rw58y/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rw58y/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rw58y,NA

A longitudinal analysis of the interaction between precariousness, gender and self-perceived health in Germany.","Over the last few decades in all European countries more and more people have been experiencing a condition of precariousness during their working lives. Whether employment precariousness could affect working people's health and whether there exists a gender differential in the relationship are crucial questions that have not been fully explored yet. Then, the aim of this paper is twofold: Firstly, it investigates the relationship between precariousness and general health in Germany; secondly, it explores whether and in which direction the health consequences of precariousness vary by gender. 
Data from the German Socio-economic Panel (SOEP, waves 2003 2007 2011 2015) are used for the analysis. By using multiple correspondence analysis, I develop a new multi-dimensional and continuous measure of precariousness, which summarizes seven different dimensions of insecurity. Further, I analyze the effect of precariousness on men’s and women’s self-perceived health by implementing ordered probit correlated random-effects models and controlling for both observed and unobserved heterogeneity.
The findings suggest that employment precariousness could be detrimental for self-perceived health for both men and women, with men being more penalized. The social consequences of employment de-standardization need to be investigated taking into account the gender norms that characterize specific cultural and institutional contexts.

Therefore, this treatise aims at studying the impact of metacognitive online reading strategies on online reading dispositions. To achieve this goal, the mixed method was employed using questionnaires and semi-structured interviews. Students’ responses were keyed to AMOS software. The statistical analysis has shown students’ preference for utilizing support strategies to tackle the problems they might face while they engage with online materials. Reflection, as a disposition, was the most frequently reported by students through their responses to the questionnaires. Further, the results confirmed the impact of metacognitive online reading strategies on online reading dispositions, which was the aim of this paper.

Numerous mitigation measures were taken to slow down the rapid spread of this pandemic. The situation, subsequently, entailed utilizing technology to ensure the continuation of the educational process. The abrupt shift to online education presented significant challenges to teachers and learners alike. Uncovering students’ perceptions of their online education experience will help address and deal with these challenges. This study attempted to explore the perceptions of Saudi female undergraduate students of their online education experience amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The total of 241 female students at the College of Languages and Translation at King Saud University in Riyadh answered a multi-item online survey. The results revealed that many of the respondents were happy with their online learning experience, enjoyed learning online and looked forward to their online classes. However, when asked to compare online learning to brick-and-mortar classes, more than half of the participants stated that they prefer traditional, face-to-face learning. The results of this study also revealed that the significant problems students faced in online education related to staying motivated, technical issues and the absence of face-to-face interaction. Despite the many challenges they face when learning online, the most cited advantage for online education mentioned by the participants is that it is more convenient. The results also indicated that this education mode seemed to suit shy students more, as they stated that they participate and ask questions more in online classes.",TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19 pandemic|e-learning; online education; technology|female Saudi EFL university learners’ perceptions,2021-05-20T13:44:02.894926,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-20T13:43:43.170967,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ym7js/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ym7js/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ym7js/citation/,ym7js,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ym7js/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ym7js/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ym7js/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60a5f6fb8b826b014b8bd7ae/,60a5f6fb8b826b014b8bd7ae,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ym7js/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ym7js/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ym7js/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ym7js/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ym7js,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/covid.28

Schools and Universities were closed. Teaching and learning were transformed from face to face environments to online platforms. In light of the latter, a pivotal query in this study was to investigate the shift of English as a foreign language (EFL) learning and teaching into Moodle online learning platform and how the delivery of online EFL courses was (un-)beneficial for students to end up the academic year. This research paper sets out to deconstruct recent calls for integrating several E-learning platforms or apps into the Algerian university. To carry out this study, we used an interview with six Algerian university teachers as a first research tool to cover all issues that arose regarding the use of MOODLE e-learning platform imposed by the Ministry of Higher Education. Another target in this paper is to uncover the main difficulties our colleagues have faced during the confinement. The second research tool we used in this survey was an online class observation followed by six questions on Moodle, the Google Meet app, and a closed Facebook group. We chose 24 MA Language and communication students from the English language department of Mostaganem University to reveal the obstacles they faced throughout the Covid- 19 Pandemic. The results showed that both teachers and students are ready to access various online platforms or apps as alternatives such as Zoom, Google Meet and Facebook closed groups to continue teaching and learning English.",TRUE,FALSE,Algerian University|Covid-19|EFL courses|MOODLE|Online platforms.,2021-05-20T13:55:41.475574,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-20T13:55:33.591564,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9kavc/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9kavc/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9kavc/citation/,9kavc,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9kavc/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9kavc/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9kavc/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60a5f3912cb36e0140c1b22a/,60a5f3912cb36e0140c1b22a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9kavc/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9kavc/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9kavc/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9kavc/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9kavc,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/covid.26
