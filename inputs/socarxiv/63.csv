This tendency is assumed to translate to the vacation context, with people from all collectivist cultures believed to be homogeneous in such behaviour. This study challenges both the above notions, and investigates for the first time both the context- and culture-dependence of one specific environmentally significant behaviour: plate waste generation. Informed by goal framing and cultural dimensions theories, this qualitative study with samples from a masculine collectivist culture (China) and a feminine collectivist culture (Slovenia) reveals that the level of pro-environmental behaviour declines in the vacation context. The possible reasons differ between both collectivist cultures.

It investigates changing human beliefs concerning the causes of diseases, how modern surgery developed and improved methods of diagnosis and the use of medical statistics. Human beliefs about the causes of disease followed a logical progression from supernatural causes, such as the wrath of the Gods, to natural causes, involving imbalances within the human body. The invention of the microscope led to the discovery of microorganisms which were eventually identified as the cause of infectious diseases. Identification of the particular microorganism causing a disease led to immunization against the disease. Modern surgery only developed after the ending of the taboo against human dissection and the discovery of modern anaesthesia and the discovery of the need for anti-septic practices. Modern diagnostic practices began with the discovery of x-rays and the invention of medical scanners. Improved mathematics, especially in probability theory, led to statistical studies which led to a much greater ability, to identify the causes of disease, and to evaluate the effectiveness of treatments. These discoveries all occurred in a necessary and inevitable order with the easiest discoveries being made first and the harder discoveries being made later.

Inspired by Kate Raworth’s Doughnut Economics, this perspective argues that the pursuit of growth as measured by such indicators creates universities that ‘grow’ up the rankings rather than those which ‘thrive’ or ‘mature’. Such growth creates academic wealth divides within and between countries, despite the direction of growth as inspired by the rankings not truly reflecting universities’ critical purpose or contribution. Highlights the incompatibility between universities’ alignment with socially responsible practices and continued engagement with socially irresponsible ranking practices. Proposes four possible ways of engendering change in the university rankings space.

Background: SES is an important predictor of mothers’ parental stress. Racial minority and immigrant mothers generally face higher parental stress than native-born White mothers. However, less is known about if the differences in stress are caused by racial and nativity disparities in SES or by the diverse impacts of SES on the stress of mothers from different racial and nativity groups.
Method: Using the second wave of Early Childhood Longitudinal Study: 2010-11 Kindergarten Class (N=8,336, https://nces.ed.gov/ecls/), I estimated racial and nativity differences in parental stress levels using OLS regression. Regression coefficients were compared across racial and nativity groups using Stata’s suest and test commands to explore racial and nativity differences in how SES predicts parental stress.
Result: Foreign-born Black, Hispanic, Asian, and native-born Asian mothers experienced higher parental stress than native-born White mothers. Low SES was associated with higher parental stress among Black and Hispanic mothers, especially among foreign-born Black mothers. Among White and Asian mothers, socioeconomic disadvantage did not necessarily predict higher parental stress. 
Conclusion: Disparities in SES are not enough to explain racial minority and immigrant mothers’ higher parental stress relative to native-born White mothers. The impact of SES on parental stress also varies across racial and nativity groups, possibly due to the systemic racism against Black and Hispanic population, and the racial and nativity differences in motherhood ideology.",TRUE,FALSE,Motherhood Ideology|Parental Stress|Race and Nativity|Role Strain Theory|SES,2021-03-14T22:39:22.868198,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-14T22:38:57.689227,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://nces.ed.gov/ecls/,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mental Health|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xfh35/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xfh35/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xfh35/citation/,xfh35,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xfh35/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/4ejz2/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xfh35/relationships/node/,4ejz2,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xfh35/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/604d06e1b57c9c015180a3b4/,604d06e1b57c9c015180a3b4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xfh35/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xfh35/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xfh35/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xfh35/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xfh35,NA

Results from OLS regression models show that following the pandemic outbreak, among women who worked full-time, mothers reported smaller stress increases than non-mothers. Among part-time and non-employed women, mothers and non-mothers experienced similar levels of stress increase. Changes in women’s work hours and employment status, following the pandemic onset, had limited impacts on the patterns of stress level changes. This study contributes to research on parenting and health by showing that during times of crisis, full-time employment may play a protective role for mother’s mental health, but may not buffer the mental health deterioration of women not raising children.",TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19|Employment|Mental Health|Parenting|Stress|Women,2021-03-14T22:38:22.236752,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-14T22:38:07.728561,TRUE,Funding provided by National Science Foundation RAPID Grant Assessing the Social Consequences of COVID-19,no,NA,,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mental Health|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yrwvs/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yrwvs/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yrwvs/citation/,yrwvs,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yrwvs/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/saecw/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yrwvs/relationships/node/,saecw,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yrwvs/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/604cfab736e58b0179bbc354/,604cfab736e58b0179bbc354,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yrwvs/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yrwvs/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yrwvs/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/yrwvs/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/yrwvs,NA

The lockdown left urban food markets in disarray with severe supply bottlenecks and restrictions on doing business. At a time when food prices in India were declining consistently, supply disruptions consequent to the lockdown have reversed the trend on average. Based on an analysis of publicly available data on wholesale and retail prices for 22 commodities from 114 Centers, we find that prices have increased since the lockdown, as of August 1, 2020. There is significant diversity across commodities and geographies that mask aggregate figures. Average price increases were to the tune of over 6% for several pulses, over 3.5% for most edible oils, 15% for potato 28% for tomato in the four weeks post-lockdown compared to prices during the four weeks preceding the lockdown. Price of meat and fish too have registered large increases. Price wedge between retail and wholesale prices increased as did spatial dispersion, both signifying friction in supply chains. We find that smaller cities have seen a much higher increase in prices with some seeing a rise in retail food prices by as much as 20%. Three rounds of surveys, conducted between April and July, of food retailers in 14 Indian cities reveal serious operational challenges. These include, among others, transport and labor shortages, police harassment and social discrimination. At the same time, several innovative arrangements and adaptations have evolved as well suggesting resilience. The paper reviews these aspects and outlines some lessons for food policy in emerging economies.",TRUE,FALSE,agrifood supply chain|COVID-19|India|lockdown|prices|retail|urban food system|wholesale,2021-03-14T22:37:21.916763,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-14T22:36:59.120349,FALSE,NA,no,Available from the first author,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d85|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Food Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Other Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Growth and Development,Sudha Narayanan; Shee Saha,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fdgky/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fdgky/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fdgky/citation/,fdgky,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fdgky/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fdgky/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fdgky/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/604cf200b57c9c0150805f8b/,604cf200b57c9c0150805f8b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fdgky/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fdgky/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fdgky/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fdgky/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fdgky,NA
