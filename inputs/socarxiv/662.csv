One of the defining properties of the approach is its formulation of accumulation crisis. Particularly, the crisis is not a recurrent manifestation of the same underlying problem in the economy. It is, instead, the overdetermined result of the contained contradictions of the configuration of the social relations in and the processes of the capitalist economy.

This article draws on feminist theories of the state to analyze how the routine practices of low-level state bureaucrats impact women's experiences navigating legal institutions in urban Nicaragua. Drawing on ten months of ethnographic fieldwork and in-depth interviews, I show how, contrary to theories of representative bureaucracy, the increased presence of women officials within state institutions does not improve most women's treatment by police or prosecutors. Rather, only when women have access to specific forms of social capital are their cases granted legitimacy by state actors. This article illustrates the routine practices by which gendered governance operates, as well as how feminist organizations disrupt patterns of bureaucratic indifference by assuming the banner of legitimacy that is rarely afforded to women victims themselves. These findings raise critical questions about the efficacy of traditional legal and bureaucratic strategies for eliminating violence against women, and suggest that one key alternative is to strengthen the capacities of civil society organizations that provide accompaniment to women victims.",TRUE,FALSE,gender|Latin America|law|Nicaragua|violence against women,2018-07-02T10:46:28.237965,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-02-27T18:38:51.947000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6gw4c/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6gw4c/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6gw4c/citation/,6gw4c,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6gw4c/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/5sjng/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6gw4c/relationships/node/,5sjng,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6gw4c/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58b471456c613b01fd7f1348/,58b471456c613b01fd7f1348,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6gw4c/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6gw4c/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6gw4c/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6gw4c/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6gw4c,https://doi.org/10.1093/sf/sow082

We are concerned here with the View in Delft, and attempt to make two points about it. The first is that this small painting manages to break away from the classical perception of perspective, an endeavor informed mostly by new findings in the field of optics of the time. The second point, theoretically related to the first, stresses compositional elements that would bring View in Delft closer to a meditation on the fleetingness of life, making it a ""town-scape"" vanitas.",TRUE,FALSE,carel fabritius|perspective,2018-07-02T10:55:01.654256,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-02-27T15:20:45.997000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76ceb|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cee|Arts and Humanities|History of Art, Architecture, and Archaeology|Ancient, Medieval, Renaissance and Baroque Art and Architecture",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xsasx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xsasx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xsasx/citation/,xsasx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xsasx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/nkw5p/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xsasx/relationships/node/,nkw5p,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xsasx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58b4436a594d9001f7db750b/,58b4436a594d9001f7db750b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xsasx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xsasx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xsasx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xsasx/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xsasx,NA
