We interviewed 1107 people in a rural area implicated in the trade, using direct and indirect questions to explore the prevalence and characteristics of jaguar trade and its links to foreign demand. Jaguar trade is a common, non-sensitive practice; 46% of respondents reported some involvement over the past 5 years. Up to 31% of respondents owned jaguar body parts, most commonly skins, fat and teeth for decorative, medicinal, and cultural purposes. Contrary to expectations, Bolivians were the most reported traders, and presence of Caucasian traders was significantly and positively associated with jaguar trade, ahead of Asian and regional traders.

Understanding the drivers of jaguar killing, trade and consumption is necessary to develop appropriate jaguar conservation strategies, particularly as demand for jaguar products appears to be rising due to Chinese demand. We interviewed 1107 rural households in north-western Bolivia, an area with an active history of human-jaguar conflict, which has also been at the epicentre of recent jaguar trade cases involving Chinese demand. We collected information on participants’ experiences with jaguars, their jaguar killing, trading and consuming behaviours, and potential drivers of these behaviours. We found that the relationships between local people and jaguars are complex, and are driven largely by traditional practices, opportunism, human-jaguar conflict and market incentives from foreign and domestic demand, in the absence of law awareness and enforcement.

Sexual victimization is a major public health, judicial and societal concern worldwide. Prevalence studies on sexual victimization have mostly focused on female and student samples. Overall, nationally representative and comparable studies are still lacking.
Methods:
We applied a broad definition of sexual violence, including hands-off and hands-on victimization, and behaviorally specific questions to assess sexual victimization. Prevalence estimates were obtained after weighting the sample according to the population proportions of men and women in three age groups. The data provide nationally representative lifetime and 12-month prevalence estimates. We further conducted logistic regression to estimate adjusted odds ratios to examine the relationship between demographic, socioeconomic, and sexuality-related variables with the likelihood of being victimized.
Results: 
These estimates indicate that 64.1% (95% CI: 61.9-66.1) of the general population in Belgium experienced some form of sexual victimization in their lives, and 44.1% (95% CI: 41.9-46.2) experienced some form of sexual victimization in the past 12 months. Logistic regression analysis shows that women are more than five times more likely to be victimized in their lifetimes than men (aOR = 4.96, 95% CI: 4.02-6.14), with an overall prevalence estimate of 80.8% (95% CI: 78.3-83.1). Young adults between 16 and 24 years are twice as likely to be victimized in their lifetimes (aOR = 2.13, 95% CI: 1.36-3.35) and more than three times more likely in the past 12 months (aOR = 3.52, 95% CI: 2.82-4.18) compared to adults aged 50 to 69 years. Prevalence estimates for all forms of sexual victimization are presented and compared to other national and international studies on sexual victimization.
Conclusion: 
This comparison suggests that prevalence rates have been underestimated . The prevalence estimates obtained in this study demonstrate that all sexes and ages are affected by sexual victimization.",TRUE,FALSE,individual-level correlates|prevalence|risk factors|sexual aggression|sexually transgressive behavior|sexual violence,2020-09-29T09:30:42.804049,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-09-29T09:30:22.780842,FALSE,NA,no,Contact authors,,no,Exploratory study describing patterns in data.,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db8|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Legal Studies|Criminology and Criminal Justice,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t7ue9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t7ue9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t7ue9/citation/,t7ue9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t7ue9/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t7ue9/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t7ue9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f72ee1c46080903df1ae198/,5f72ee1c46080903df1ae198,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t7ue9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t7ue9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t7ue9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/t7ue9/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/t7ue9,NA

After years of decreasing public punitiveness and declining crime rates, politicians are seeking evidence-based crime policies to reduce mass incarceration without increasing crime. One such policy that has been implemented in several U.S. cities is the Operation Peacemaker Fellowship (OPF), which incentivizes conformity and program participation by providing monetary stipends to individuals at risk of violent offending, thereby simultaneously reducing violence and incarceration. Yet, there is no evidence about public support for such policies. 

Methods. Using a nationally representative survey experiment, we examine public support for violence prevention stipends. We employ a referendum-style, contingent valuation design to measure the impact of tax increases versus tax savings on public opinion, and we randomize message framing that emphasizes the stipend program’s risky versus protective features.

Results. Both tax changes and risk framing matter. The public is willing to vote for stipends when they reduce taxes and are framed as a method to save lives. Most Republicans oppose stipends under all conditions.

Conclusions. Reformers can increase public support for effective, non-punitive policies that target violent offenders by emphasizing both their economic and social benefits. However, such policies are likely to face consistent opposition from certain portions of the public.",TRUE,FALSE,experiment|framing|prison downsizing|public opinion|Stipends,2020-09-29T07:17:01.700690,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-09-29T07:16:48.625984,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://osf.io/7gehm/files/,no,"Prior to data collection, the experimental design was preregistered in the form of a grant application submitted to TESS in 2017 (#0966).",,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance",The authors,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ms2gz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ms2gz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ms2gz/citation/,ms2gz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ms2gz/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/7gehm/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ms2gz/relationships/node/,7gehm,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ms2gz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f72557468d850036389fb79/,5f72557468d850036389fb79,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ms2gz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ms2gz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ms2gz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ms2gz/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ms2gz,NA

In this study, we outline and test a theoretical model of neighborhood effects on cognitive development during early childhood that highlights the mediating role of environmental health hazards, and in particular, exposure to neurotoxic lead. To evaluate this model, we follow a cohort of 1,266 children in the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods from birth through the time of school entry, matching them at each survey wave with information on neighborhood composition and the areal risk of lead exposure. With these data, we then estimate the joint effects of neighborhood poverty and environmental lead contamination on receptive vocabulary ability. We find that sustained exposure to disadvantaged neighborhoods substantially reduces vocabulary ability during early childhood and that nearly all of this effect may operate through a causal mechanism involving lead contamination. These findings are robust to unobserved confounding and to the use of several alternative estimation strategies, which suggests that living in a disadvantaged neighborhood impedes early childhood development because it increases exposure to environmental toxins like lead.",TRUE,FALSE,child development|cognitive ability|inequality|lead|mediation|neighborhoods|poverty|regression-with-residuals|residual balancing,2020-09-29T22:08:22.503100,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-09-29T22:07:16.828519,FALSE,NA,no,"This study is based on restricted-use data, which were licensed under special contractual

Patients and caregivers engaged in palliative care may experience deteriorated mental and social health conditions. Global evidence informs a high burden of depression, anxiety, psychological distress, and other mental health problems among the palliative care populations. Those challenges aggravate the preexisting palliative care issues, such as lack of access and suboptimal quality of care. Palliative caregiving, both in the institutional and community settings, should be strengthened, incorporating psychosocial support for the patients and their caregivers. The recent advancements in digital health technologies have shown promising impacts in facilitating health communication, decision-making, and delivering psychosocial interventions using digital devices and platforms. Adopting evidence-based interventions can help the users to access mental health resources and communicate with each other to promote shared decision-making and management of health problems.

However, nowadays, the primary function of such databases is often mixed up, confused with functions that are not intended for it, such as to select content based on language (e.g. English vs. Non-English issue), as well as to rank publications based on certain metrics. It is urgent to prove the fallacy of the trending use of the indexation.
Objectives: This study aims to describe empirically whether there are differences in document distribution, openly accessible documents, and geographical coverages of Earth sciences topics based on searched scientific databases, as the basis for proposing new perspectives in Earth sciences research assessment.
Methods: Document selection using ‘Earth sciences’ keywords in English and native languages was done on ten databases. Quantitative-descriptive design with a frequency analysis technique was employed. 
Results: (1) The number of English-written articles in international databases significantly exceeded the number of those written in native languages that were detected in national-level databases; (2) The sum of open access (OA) articles in national databases is higher than in other databases; (3) The geographical coverages of Earth sciences documents are unbalanced between countries when comparing retrievals from closed-commercial databases with the other databases. 
Conclusions: Earth sciences is one of the geographical sensitive field sciences that is closely needed to solve local problems with local physical and social settings. A combination of quantitative and qualitative measurements are very much needed in research performance assessment.

Real populations in these processes, however, are structured with internal classes or stages, and classes are sometimes created based on social differentiation. In this present work, information about the colonization of old Providence Island was used to create an agent-based model of the colonization process in a heterogeneous environment for a population with social differentiation. Agents were socially divided into two classes and modeled with dissimilar spatial clustering preferences. The model and simulations assessed the importance of gregarious behavior for colonization processes conducted in heterogeneous environments by socially-differentiated populations. Results suggest that in these conditions, the colonization process starts with an agent cluster in the largest and most suitable area. The spatial distribution of agents maintained a tendency toward randomness as simulation time increased, even when gregariousness values increased. The most conspicuous effects in agent clustering were produced by the initial conditions and behavioral adaptations that increased the agent capacity to access more resources and the likelihood of gregariousness. The approach presented here could be used to analyze past human colonization events or support long-term conceptual design of future human colonization processes with small social formations into unfamiliar and uninhabited environments.",TRUE,FALSE,Archaeology|Caribbean|Gregarious Behavior|Human Colonization|Settlement patterns|Social Differentiation,2020-09-26T19:22:20.933953,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-09-26T19:22:04.135118,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://www.comses.net/codebases/d5cfd5b6-6cfe-4dbc-ab9c-6fadb3ed688a/releases/1.0.0/,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Archaeological Anthropology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7z6xp/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7z6xp/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7z6xp/citation/,7z6xp,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7z6xp/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7z6xp/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7z6xp/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f6f7e0346080902f21b3d1c/,5f6f7e0346080902f21b3d1c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7z6xp/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7z6xp/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7z6xp/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7z6xp/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7z6xp,https://doi.org/10.18564/jasss.4433
