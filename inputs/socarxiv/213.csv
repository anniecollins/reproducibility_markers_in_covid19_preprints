The high intervisibility of the watchtowers in the Gask Ridge system has resulted in the proposal of two main functions: one that the watchtowers were a signalling system and two that the watchtowers provided visibility of the Gask Ridge road for surveillance and monitoring. Despite this, only the former function has been assessed. This paper explores the function of the watchtowers along the Gask Ridge road using computational methods, including Monte Carlo hypothesis testing. The analytical approach, which is documented and reproducible with accompanying code, rejects that the watchtowers were randomly located along the Gask Ridge road, instead favouring the alternative hypothesis that the watchtowers were located to maximise the visibility of the road. Furthermore, it is possible to claim that the need to monitor the road shows a causal relationship with the location of the watchtowers, rather than associative. The findings support the interpretation that main function of the watchtowers was for the surveillance and monitoring of the Gask Ridge road, providing an early warning system of an attack from the Highlands (Woolliscroft, 1993).",TRUE,FALSE,Monte Carlo|Point Pattern|Roman|spatial statistics|visibility,2020-05-04T15:01:21.309084,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-28T03:23:51.305819,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccb|Arts and Humanities|Digital Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d88|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Geographic Information Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Archaeological Anthropology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ebt9n/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ebt9n/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ebt9n/citation/,ebt9n,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ebt9n/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ebt9n/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ebt9n/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ea69e32e4f08100f107a7b6/,5ea69e32e4f08100f107a7b6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ebt9n/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ebt9n/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ebt9n/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ebt9n/,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jasrep.2020.102482,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ebt9n

Strong concentration has been seen as both a tool for optimizing and focusing research investments, but also as a damaging path towards hypercompetition, lacking diversity and conservative research topic selection. While several studies have documented high funding concentration linked to individual funding organisations, few have looked at funding concentration from a systemic perspective. In this article, we examine nearly 20,000 competitive grants allocated by fifteen major Danish research funders. Our results show a strongly skewed allocation of funding towards a small elite of individual researchers, and toward a very select group of research areas and topics. We discuss several potential drivers, and highlight that strong funding concentrations likely result from a complex interplay between funders’ overlapping priorities, excellence-dominated evaluation criteria, and lack of coordination between both public and private research funding bodies.",TRUE,FALSE,diversity|funding concentration|research funding|research policy|research priorities,2020-05-04T15:01:00.045247,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-27T14:44:17.286230,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76ded|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Science and Technology Policy",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j874c/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j874c/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j874c/citation/,j874c,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j874c/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j874c/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j874c/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ea6879b3854e200e269e31d/,5ea6879b3854e200e269e31d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j874c/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j874c/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j874c/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/j874c/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/j874c

We examine patterns in who experiences solitary confinement in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody, as well as the stated reason for, and length of, their confinement. We reveal several findings. First, cases involving individuals with mental illnesses are overrepresented, more likely to occur without infraction, and to last longer, compared to cases involving individuals without mental illnesses. Second, solitary confinement cases involving immigrants from Africa and the Caribbean are vastly overrepresented in comparison to the share of these groups in the overall detained population, and African immigrants are more likely to be confined for disciplinary reasons, compared to the average. Finally, placement patterns vary significantly by facility and institution type, with private facilities more likely to solitarily confine people without infraction, compared to public facilities. This study offers a lens through which to more precisely theorize the legal boundary-blurring of crimmigration and the relationship between prison and immigration detention policies, to better understand the practice of solitary confinement across carceral contexts, and to analyze the relationship between national-level policy and on-the-ground implementation.",TRUE,FALSE,discretion|immigration detention|immigration prisons|punishment|solitary confinement,2020-04-27T04:07:18.434656,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-27T04:06:46.068137,FALSE,NA,no,,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zdy7f/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zdy7f/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zdy7f/citation/,zdy7f,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zdy7f/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zdy7f/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zdy7f/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ea655a5e4f08100dc07e7b5/,5ea655a5e4f08100dc07e7b5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zdy7f/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zdy7f/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zdy7f/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zdy7f/,https://doi.org/10.1177/1462474520967804,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zdy7f

We ask how population counts produced under the differential privacy algorithm might lead to different conclusions regarding population growth for the total population and three major racial/ethnic groups in comparison to counts produced using the traditional methods. Our results suggest that the implementation of differential privacy, as proposed, will impact our understanding of population changes in the US. We find potential for overstating and understating growth and decline, with these effects being more pronounced for non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics, as well as for non-metropolitan counties.

The forecasts from these models were then compared to the actual frequency of crime during the early months of the pandemic. There were no significant changes in the frequency of serious assaults in public or (contrary to the concerns of policy makers) any change to the frequency of serious assaults in residences. In many cities, there were reductions in residential burglary but little change in non-residential burglary.

The latest update claims about 4,000,000 confirmed cases and about 300,000 confirmed deaths owing to the COVID-19 pandemic. This probably makes the COVID-19 as the most dangerous contagious disease in the era 2000s. Apart from massive publications on this topic, there is no available qualitative analysis that describes the dynamic spreads of the COVID-19 and its impacts on healthcare and the economy. Through the system archetypes analysis, this paper explains that the dynamic spread of the COVID-19 consists of the limits to growth and the success to successful structures. The limits to growth elucidates that more symptomatic and asymptomatic patients owing to infected droplets may be bounded by self-healing and isolated treatments. The success to successful structure explains that once the COVID-19 affects the economy through the lockdown, there will be a limited fund to support the government aids and the aggregate demand. In overall, this paper gives readers simplified holistic insights into understanding the dynamic spread of the COVID-19.",TRUE,FALSE,Coronavirus|COVID-19|system archetypes|the impacts of COVID-19 on economy|the impacts of COVID-19 on healthcare|the impacts of the Covid-19|the limits to growth|the success to successful,2020-04-27T04:02:02.671669,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-27T04:01:38.092885,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dea|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Policy Design, Analysis, and Evaluation",Muhamad Bahri,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yj8c9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yj8c9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yj8c9/citation/,yj8c9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yj8c9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yj8c9/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yj8c9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ea55d61e4f08100bf07945d/,5ea55d61e4f08100bf07945d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yj8c9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yj8c9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yj8c9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/yj8c9/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/yj8c9

The offence and the life course in accounts of adaptation to life imprisonment,"Recent studies of long-term imprisonment describe a largely invariant pattern of prisoner adaptation. Using data from a qualitative study of men serving life sentences in England, I argue that adaptation may in fact vary more than these studies imply both because of the prisoner’s age when sentenced and because of the circumstances of particular offences. Participants’ engagement with the prison’s rehabilitative ‘offer’ depended on how the sentence affected their life course and what they understood to be the moral ramifications of the offence. These findings refine understanding of adaptation and suggest that a renewed focus on moral reflexivity may bear fruit in future prison research.

The best research protocol to date on predicting and preventing infectious disease emergence states that urgent research must commence to identify unknown human and animal pathogens. This short communication proposes that the ethnobiological knowledge of indigenous and impoverished communities can be a source of information about some of those unknown pathogens. I present the ecological and anthropological theory behind this proposal, as well as a few case studies that serve as a limited proof of concept. This paper also serves as a call to arms for the medical anthropology community. It gives a brief primer on the EID crisis and how anthropology research may be vital to limiting its havoc on global health. Local knowledge is not likely to play a major role in EID research initiatives, but the use of the incorporation of EID awareness into standard medical anthropological practice would have myriad benefits, even if no EIDs were discovered this way.",TRUE,FALSE,emerging infectious disease|ethnobiology|global health|indigenous knowledge|local knowledge|medical anthropology|public health|Stockholm Paradigm|traditional ecological knowledge|veterinary medicine,2020-04-27T03:58:00.814600,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-27T03:57:35.037480,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Nature and Society Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eygkw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eygkw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eygkw/citation/,eygkw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eygkw/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eygkw/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eygkw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ea49a083854e2009169eb78/,5ea49a083854e2009169eb78,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eygkw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eygkw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eygkw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/eygkw/,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2020.113107,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/eygkw
