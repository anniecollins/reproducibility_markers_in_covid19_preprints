The treatment significantly impacted the likelihood of choosing to discuss sanitation, health, poverty, democracy, individual determination, pro-poor support, and happiness. However, the intervention does not affect subjectively ranked preferences.

The controllability of a physical threat, for example, affects the processing of subsequent social stress. Animal research has shown that the vmPFC plays a critical role in behavioral control and orchestrating subcortical responses. However, translational research on these neural systems in humans is sparse and we therefore aimed to develop a paradigm to test the generalization effect of behavioral control on vmPFC functioning. A pilot study was performed in which subjects (n=18) were first randomly assigned to one of two versions of a signal detection task, where feedback was either paired with a controllable or an uncontrollable mild shock. Subsequently, subjects underwent a social evaluative threat fMRI paradigm to measure their response to the anticipation of speaking in public. The analyses tested whether the controllability manipulation influenced behavioral and physiological responses and vmPFC network topology.  Results showed that overall subjects were faster to respond to potential shock trials in the signal detection task, and there was a trend significant difference between the  controllable or uncontrollable group. No significant differences between the two groups were observed on other behavioral or physiological responses. fMRI results showed higher vmPFC efficiency in the controllable threat group at baseline and recovery but similar to the uncontrollable group during speech anticipation.

If you purchase products from a business that pays the pizzo you are indirectly supporting the mafia. By encouraging Palermitans to buy from ‘pizzo-free’ businesses, Addiopizzo uses the purchasing power of the consumer to fight organised crime. The community of ‘pizzo-free’ businesses is small but steadily growing whilst the number of critical consumers pledging to buy their products appears to have peaked. This article aims to investigate the reasons why consumers may be reluctant to support ‘pizzo-free’ businesses by asking those who have already made public their decision to do so. Whilst critical consumers cannot fully explain why the majority of Palermo's citizens continue to tolerate the pizzo system their attitudes towards them do highlight differences that may help to account for wider non-participation in Addiopizzo's campaign.",TRUE,FALSE,Addiopizzo|antimafia|protection money|Sicily|social movements,2018-07-02T10:55:52.187580,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-04-24T21:00:35.827518,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/exquy/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/exquy/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/exquy/citation/,exquy,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/exquy/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/hj2gx/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/exquy/relationships/node/,hj2gx,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/exquy/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58fe65d0b83f69025146cb70/,58fe65d0b83f69025146cb70,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/exquy/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/exquy/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/exquy/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/exquy/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/exquy,https://doi.org/10.1080/13532944.2011.594999

Exploring the Relationship Between Disapproval of Organizations and Job Satisfaction in the French Context.,"Previous research has found that a positive relationship exists between favorable perception of a firm and employees’ job satisfaction: the more positively an organization is perceived, the happier are its workers. However, the current literature has overlooked the consequences of a negative corporate image, or disapproval of organizations. Building on the concept of organizational identification and the social identity literature, we fill in this gap and counterintuitively argue that employees are more likely to identify and align with their organizations when it faces illegitimate criticism. We test our hypotheses on a large-scale survey collected in France and find that perception of disapproval of an organization has indeed an adverse effect on job satisfaction. However, if employees perceive criticism as illegitimate, job satisfaction is positively impacted. This study suggests the existence of micro-level social identity reactions in case of unjustified disapprobation: employees stick together and hold the line against criticism, strengthening the collective identity and adding positive emotional value to the work experience.",TRUE,FALSE,disapproval|job satisfaction|legitimacy|motivation|organizational theory|sociology,2018-07-02T10:55:51.410362,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-04-22T16:28:03.491719,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Leadership Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Organization Development|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e48|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Labor and Labor Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Social Psychology and Interaction",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wez38/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wez38/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wez38/citation/,wez38,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wez38/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/fe3ym/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wez38/relationships/node/,fe3ym,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wez38/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58fb83d7594d90024eb6883f/,58fb83d7594d90024eb6883f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wez38/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wez38/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wez38/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wez38/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wez38,NA

Our objective was to estimate the association between increases in mortality in middle-aged non-Hispanic white adults from 1999-2005 to 2009-2015, health inequalities in life expectancy by income, and the surge in support for the Republican Party in pivotal US counties in the 2016 presidential election. We conducted a longitudinal ecological study in 2764 US counties from 1999 to 2016. Increases in mortality were measured using age-specific (45-54 years of age) all-cause mortality from 1999-2005 to 2009-2015 at the county level. Support for the Republican Party was measured as the party’s vote share in the presidential election in 2016 adjusted for results in 2008 and 2012. We found a significant up-turn in mortality from 1999-2005 to 2009-2015 in counties where the Democratic Party won twice (2008 and 2012) but where the Republican Party won in 2016 (+10.7/100,000), as compared to those in which the Democratic Party won in 2016 (-15.7/100,000). An increase in mortality of 15.2/100,000 was associated with a significant (p&lt;0.001) 1% vote swing from the 2008-2012 average to 2016. We also found that counties with wider health inequalities in life expectancy were more likely to vote Republican in 2016, regardless of the previous voting patterns. Counties with worsening premature mortality in the last 15 years and wider health inequalities shifted votes toward the Republican Party presidential candidate. Further understanding of causes of unanticipated deterioration in health in the general population can inform social policy.

In search for the subaltern we mostly can not articulate ourselves as theory. Our inquiries in to the epistemic domain (‘What can we know of the subaltern?’), the metaphysical domain has largely gone unanswered (‘What makes the subaltern possible?’). Here I would like to propose that the solution lies in our proleterization process.

Apportionment is performed with respect to the proportion of damage path area and to the underlying population density. The method is illustrated with raster grids on tornadoes occurring between 1955 and 2015 within the most tornado-prone region of the United States. Validation of the results using county- and grid-level data reveals strong correlation between dasymetric estimated and location-specific counts. On a broad spatial scale the method provides a better estimate of where casualties have occurred than counting the number of casualty-producing tornadoes. Case studies using the 1974 Xenia, OH and the 1994 Piedmont, AL tornadoes highlight limitations of the method and indicate that results will be improved with more precise tornado path information. Future work that includes socioeconomic variables (demographics, ethnicity, poverty and housing stock/value) might allow populations to be profiled with regards to vulnerability.",TRUE,FALSE,casualties|dasymetric mapping|tornado,2018-07-02T10:55:51.090339,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-04-20T16:20:33.999502,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d88|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Geographic Information Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Physical and Environmental Geography,Tyler Fricker,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q2abe/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q2abe/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q2abe/citation/,q2abe,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q2abe/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/fepy4/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q2abe/relationships/node/,fepy4,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q2abe/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58f8ddfa6c613b02511e04e5/,58f8ddfa6c613b02511e04e5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q2abe/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q2abe/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q2abe/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/q2abe/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/q2abe,NA
