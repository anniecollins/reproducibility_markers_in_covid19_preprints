The term effective coverage, introduced by the World Health Organization, was used as a reference to adjust the aggregate indicators on the ECLAC database taking into account the target population of the programs. (1) Effective coverage of beneficiaries is a metric that shows the potential proportion of population living in monetary poverty that benefits from the CCTs. (2) Effective coverage of benefits shows the potential proportion of the monetary poverty line value invested by the CCTs. Only three CCTs presented an effective coverage of beneficiaries higher than the total population in monetary poverty, and nine over the total population in extreme monetary poverty. Meanwhile, ten CCTs presented an effective coverage of benefits higher than the extreme monetary poverty line value, and seven higher than the monetary poverty line value.",TRUE,FALSE,caribbean|cash transfer|CCT|Conditional cash transfer programs|conditional cash transfers|coverage|effective coverage|latin america|poverty|Poverty; Latin America and the Caribbean,2019-02-02T04:39:07.666994,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-02T04:38:32.844494,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Welfare|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76deb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Policy",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qrnme/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qrnme/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qrnme/citation/,qrnme,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qrnme/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qrnme/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qrnme/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c54dd1476653c001821ecf1/,5c54dd1476653c001821ecf1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qrnme/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qrnme/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qrnme/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qrnme/,https://doi.org/10.11606/issn.1676-6288.prolam.2015.109052,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qrnme

One of the limitations of the scholarship has been the conceptualization and operationalization of the WS and poverty as one-dimensional variables. The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between welfare state development, single-dimensions deprivations and income inequality in Latin America and the Caribbean, before and after controlling for demographic and cyclical factors. The WS is operationalized as a one-dimensional variable, but also taking into account its multidimensional nature. Three individual deprivations suffered by people on poverty and two income inequality indicators are used as dependent variables. Three pooled time-series cross-section regression analyses with panel-corrected standard errors models were carried out on 18 countries in the region around 2000, 2005 and 2010. This paper shows that the development of social-welfare programs and institutions seems to be an effective way of tackling individual deprivations suffered by people on poverty in the region. On the other hand, the WS development didn’t appear to be effective to reduce income inequality. The outcomes of welfare institutions appear to be the pivotal dimension to reduce income inequality and income deprivations in the region.",TRUE,FALSE,caribbean|inequality|latin america|multidimensional poverty|multidimensional welfare index|poverty|redistribution|regression analysis|welfare state|welfare state development,2019-02-02T04:38:46.023131,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-02T04:38:18.197493,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|Latin American Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Welfare|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76deb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Policy",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yw8kg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yw8kg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yw8kg/citation/,yw8kg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yw8kg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yw8kg/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/5t732/,5t732,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yw8kg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c54dbcfe16f5500178734f7/,5c54dbcfe16f5500178734f7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yw8kg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yw8kg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yw8kg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/yw8kg/,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11205-016-1465-4,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/yw8kg

There are several ways in which governments can create fiscal space to finance social protection programmes (e.g. social pensions). The idea is to create new sources of revenue –sustainable in the long-run – which can be used to finance social pensions, without building new liabilities and without distorting macroeconomic stability. The literature specifically addressing the potential fiscal space that could be created to finance social pensions is limited. This paper aims to begin filling some of those gaps and identify sources for creating fiscal space for social pensions through the revenue side (i.e. examine the revenue-generating potential of taxation for social pensions). Specifically, examine the potential funding power of three types of taxes (income tax, corporate tax, and trade tax) using cross-country tax revenues and tax rate data in a global perspective. The paper demonstrates that the three taxes have a revenue-generating potential to finance social pensions in several countries. There is not a magic prescription useful for every country, but there are numerous options to design a tailored mix of sources to create fiscal space. *This study was funded by Help Age International, while the author was a Research Fellow.",TRUE,FALSE,ageing|aging|cash transfer|fiscal space|latin america|LMICs|older-age|pension|social pension|social spending|tax|welfare state,2019-02-02T04:38:00.901618,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-02T04:37:43.837819,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dce|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Public Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Welfare|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76deb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Policy",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pgxmk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pgxmk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pgxmk/citation/,pgxmk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pgxmk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pgxmk/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/u687n/,u687n,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pgxmk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c54d84de16f550018871e0b/,5c54d84de16f550018871e0b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pgxmk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pgxmk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pgxmk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pgxmk/,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12126-017-9298-2,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pgxmk

A classification of welfare regimes is carried out following a bottom-up approach and relying on the basis of the importance of welfare providers to satisfy social risks and promote well-being. Three traditional (e.g., state, market, family) and one alternative welfare provider (e.g., community) are considered. Data is collected through twenty semi-structured interviews in seven marginalised communities of Puerto Rico. The results show five configurations of intra-national welfare-mixes across the following welfare areas: housing, nourishment, health, education, maternity/paternity, disability, work-unemployment and older-age. This paper contributes to the theoretical proposals of intra-national welfare regimes, and alternatives providers in the welfare-mix.",TRUE,FALSE,caribbean|community|comunidades especiales|disability|intra-national welfare regime|latin america|maternity leave|pension|puerto rico|unemployment|welfare-mix|welfare regime|welfare state,2019-02-02T04:35:27.613675,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-02T04:34:55.999343,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Welfare|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Urban Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dea|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Policy Design, Analysis, and Evaluation|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76deb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Administration",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8c2ex/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8c2ex/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8c2ex/citation/,8c2ex,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8c2ex/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8c2ex/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/k2dj8/,k2dj8,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8c2ex/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c54d5b3e16f550018871cdb/,5c54d5b3e16f550018871cdb,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8c2ex/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8c2ex/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8c2ex/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8c2ex/,https://doi.org/10.1080/21699763.2018.1526696,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8c2ex

Una mirada desde las comunidades marginadas en Puerto Rico,"Las comunidades marginadas en Puerto Rico presentan cicatrices sociales por la estigmatización, desigualdad y falta de oportunidades experimentadas durante décadas. Está obra recoge expresiones de este sector tradicionalmente marginado por el gobierno, mercado y la misma sociedad puertorriqueña. Dos son los principales propósitos del libro: (1) realizar un análisis histórico del desarrollo e institucionalización del Estado de bienestar emergente en Puerto Rico, y (2) examinar las relaciones del bienestar y la distribución de riesgos sociales entre los principales actores garantes del bienestar en las comunidades marginadas del archipiélago caribeño.

Para cumplir el primer propósito se realiza una revisión histórica sobre el desarrollo de las instituciones y programas del bienestar puertorriqueño. El segundo objetivo del libro se materializa mediante la exposición de datos y relatos recopilados mediante entrevistas semiestructuradas y encuestas en siete comunidades marginadas del país (Daguao, Dulces Labios, El Rabanal, Playita Cortada, San Antón, Toro Negro y Tras Talleres).

El valor añadido de este libro a los estudios de regímenes de bienestar es la conceptualización de la comunidad como uno de los principales actores garantes del bienestar junto a la familia, Estado y mercado. Asimismo, se demuestra el grado de (des)mercantilización, (des)familiarización y estadocentrismo/residualismo de los programas de bienestar puertorriqueños en las áreas de vivienda, maternidad/paternidad, educación, alimentación, salud, incapacidad, (des)empleo y vejez. Los resultados demuestran la existencia de un Estado de bienestar limitado y estratificado, el cual sigue el tipo de régimen de bienestar residual aunque con un gran peso en la familia tradicional en el área de cuidado y con programas subsidiarios de tipo corporativista para la población trabajadora en el mercado formal.",TRUE,FALSE,america latina|caribbean|caribe|comunidades especiales|estado|estado de bienestar|familia|latin america|mercado|puerto rico|regimen de bienestar|riesgos sociales|welfare state,2019-02-02T04:27:27.611588,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-02T04:26:56.651376,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Other Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Welfare|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e25|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Community and Urban Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e33|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Development|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yb2zf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yb2zf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yb2zf/citation/,yb2zf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yb2zf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yb2zf/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/k2dj8/,k2dj8,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yb2zf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c54d309832ca60018a63bb9/,5c54d309832ca60018a63bb9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yb2zf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yb2zf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yb2zf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/yb2zf/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/yb2zf

The third section presents an analysis of the content and form of the representation of corruption, upon which the traces of historical development in the practice of political cartoon will be explored.

States define the powers of local governments within their purview and states may use this power to restrict local governments from pursuing certain policies. Using data on state legislative activity and ideology from 1993 to 2016, I find within-state increases in legislative ideology, indicating increased legislative conservatism, associated with an increased risk of preempting local government policy, all else equal. This finding is robust to a number of alternate specifications and hypotheses.

With this scientific concept of dignity, this paper can smoothly solve a series of hard problems, including (1) how human ancestors stood up from four-legged animals; (2) why humans got dressed; (3) how humans acquired wisdom; (4) why humans commit suicide; and (5) why humans have developed into what you see today.",TRUE,FALSE,animal mission|dignity|face|human mission|human origins|humiliation,2020-05-13T14:13:24.737446,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-13T13:29:29.393004,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d9b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Cognition and Perception|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Biological Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76da5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Personality and Social Contexts|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dad|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Applied Behavior Analysis|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Behavioral Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Animal Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfc|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Biological and Physical Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e21|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Evolution, Biology, and Society",Xinzhen Yu,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u3ys6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u3ys6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u3ys6/citation/,u3ys6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u3ys6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u3ys6/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u3ys6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c52d518ede2b5001b63f317/,5c52d518ede2b5001b63f317,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u3ys6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u3ys6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u3ys6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/u3ys6/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/u3ys6
