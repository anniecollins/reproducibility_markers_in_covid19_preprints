An increase in the number of childless people has been observed throughout Europe, North America, and Japan. Accompanying this trend, the mean age at first childbirth has increased. However, whether the phenomenon of remaining childless or that of postponing first childbirth is the main contributor has not been clearly investigated. The aim of this study is to quantify those effects using a decomposition method. We employ the classical life table method to measure changes in first childbirth behavior. Life expectancy is normally used in mortality research to represent the average number of years people live. In childlessness (first childbirth) research, life expectancy signifies the expected number of years without children, as the event of focus is first childbirth. Thus, we define the expected years without children as age 15 to age 50 (EYWC) using the Coale-McNeil model. To avoid the problems of truncation and censoring, only completed cohort fertility data of eight selected countries from the Human Fertility Database are examined. EYWC is decomposed into three factors: remaining childless, postponing first childbirth, and expansion of the standard deviation of mean age at first childbirth. Results of the decomposition show that postponement is mainly occurred in North America and Northern European countries. Contrarily, remaining childless is observed as the main contributor in Japan and Portugal.",TRUE,FALSE,childlessness|Coale-McNeil model|decomposition method|life expectancy|postpone first birth,2018-11-29T20:20:06.287355,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-11-29T20:19:37.054413,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hy98w/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hy98w/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hy98w/citation/,hy98w,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hy98w/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/hce2u/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hy98w/relationships/node/,hce2u,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hy98w/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bfe4c2a354448001762d7a3/,5bfe4c2a354448001762d7a3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hy98w/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hy98w/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hy98w/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hy98w/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hy98w,NA

Since 1990, the U.S. Department of Defense has transferred excess military equipment to domestic law enforcement agencies via the federal 1033 program. This article examines transfers of mine-resistant ambush-protected vehicles or MRAPs. Designed to withstand explosive blasts during U.S. military occupations in Iraq and Afghanistan, surplus MRAPs have been shipped to more than 800 domestic law enforcement agencies. This article uses national data on law enforcement agencies and on 1033 program transfers to analyze the pattern of MRAP distribution. The results show that MRAPs are disproportionately acquired by agencies that have warrior tendencies and rely on asset forfeiture to generate revenue.

When tracing the life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of traded products, for example for border carbon adjustments, such emissions are counted at each border crossing. The prevalence and dynamics of this phenomenon have been poorly understood. This paper shows that GHG emissions associated with the production of imports used for producing exports have risen rapidly from 1995, peaking in 2012 and declining slightly to 2016. They now constitute a total of 4.4 PgCO2equ. or 10% of global emissions. The most important exported products in terms of emissions associated with imported inputs are chemicals, vehicles, machinery, and information and communications technology (ICT). Crude petroleum, iron and steel, chemicals, and ICT components are the imported products being used for this export production. A driver analysis indicates that in industrialized countries, the declining domestic value added in exports and increasing share of exports in GDP have contributed most to this development, while in emerging economies, the growth of GDP itself has been an important driving factor, while declines in the energy intensity of export production have provided a weak counterbalance. The importance of transiting carbon raises questions of how climate policies affect industrial competitiveness and how border tax adjustment would account for such emissions.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-11-29T20:16:21.148607,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-11-29T20:16:04.397657,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Nature and Society Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcc|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|International Economics,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zb3rh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zb3rh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zb3rh/citation/,zb3rh,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zb3rh/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/rsdch/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zb3rh/relationships/node/,rsdch,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zb3rh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bfd80e493731d0018323289/,5bfd80e493731d0018323289,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zb3rh/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zb3rh/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zb3rh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zb3rh/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zb3rh,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2019.104651

In offline social network sampling, for practical considerations, researchers sometimes build in a cap on the number of social ties any respondent may claim. It is commonly known in the literature that using a cap on the degrees begets methodologically undesirable features because it discards information about the network connections. In this paper, we consider a mathematical model of this sampling procedure and seek analytical solutions to recover some of the lost information about the underlying network. We obtain closed-form expressions for several network statistics, including the first and second moments of the degree distribution, network density, number of triangles, and clustering.

This framework – both in the shape of legislative instruments and case law – has inevitably also affected those asylum seekers who claim asylum on the basis of sexual orientation and/or gender identity (SOGI). This has been vividly demonstrated by particular norms in EU asylum instruments and judgments of the Court of Justice of EU (CJEU). The current CEAS can be said to have several shortcomings in relation to SOGI claims, including in relation to: accelerated procedures; country of origin information; the notion of ‘safe country of origin’; the burden of proof and the principle of benefit of the doubt; the concept of a ‘particular social group’; and the definition of persecution. 
A new set of proposals for reform of the CEAS was put forward in 2016, and these also affect SOGI asylum claims in precise and acute ways. This contribution scrutinises these proposals of reform, including the different positions of the Commission, Parliament and Council, where relevant. In particular, this contribution will assess the extent to which these proposals and different institutional positions address, ignore or aggravate the issues that currently affect SOGI asylum seekers.",TRUE,FALSE,asylum|CEAS|European Union|gender identity|queer|refugees|sexual orientation|trans,2018-11-27T08:55:01.616963,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-11-27T08:54:51.318558,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c16|Law|Law and Gender|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c1d|Law|International Humanitarian Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c34|Law|Human Rights Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c35|Law|Sexuality and the Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c3b|Law|Civil Rights and Discrimination|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c4b|Law|Law and Society|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c53|Law|International Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c70|Law|European Law,Nuno Ferreira,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xag5u/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xag5u/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xag5u/citation/,xag5u,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xag5u/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/uscvn/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xag5u/relationships/node/,uscvn,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xag5u/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bfd00dec7e8ba001bdf1e3c/,5bfd00dec7e8ba001bdf1e3c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xag5u/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xag5u/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xag5u/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xag5u/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xag5u,NA

In their study, Darney et al disputed evidence from our study (Koch et al, BMJ Open 2015;5(2):e006013), which found a null association between abortion laws and MMR, and reported their own conclusion of a negative association between abortion availability and MMR. After replicating their dataset and statistical analysis, we found that the beta coefficient (effect size) for abortion legislation was apparently misinterpreted by Darney et al to support the conclusion that legislation allowing abortion on request in Mexico City was associated with a 22.49-unit decrease in MMR. In fact, their analysis showed the opposite result: after multivariable adjustments, Mexico City was associated with a 22.49-unit increase in MMR compared with the 31 states with restricted access to abortion. Moreover, Darney et al did not report the initial time-adjusted effect size, where the 95% CI supports the hypothesis of null association (beta = 4.17; 95%CI -7.19 to 15.54; p=0.470). In our re-analysis of their data, estimates were highly unstable in multiple regression models, and the initial effect size (4.17) for the association between abortion legislation and the MMR was inflated up to 5-fold (22.49) as a result of a ‘tipping effect’ on coefficients and multicollinearity among covariates.

Unlike prior research, we correct for the underreporting of means-tested transfers and incorporate the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP). Doing so reduces the share of children below $2 per day from about 1.8% to 0.1%. That said, we acknowledge use of survey data omits the estimated 1.3 million homeless children in 2014-2015. We find that three different measures of extreme child poverty have declined since 1997. Unlike prior literature’s focus on single motherhood, citizenship status is the more consequential characteristic. Between 58-73% of children in extreme poverty live in households headed by non-citizens. Simulations granting them access to the median SNAP benefit reduce their extreme poverty substantially. Two-way fixed effects models show that higher state-level generosity and take up of SNAP and TANF significantly reduce extreme poverty. Unlike prior research’s focus on the decline of TANF, we show SNAP has grown in generosity and take-up.

In an attempt to curb
unauthorized migration, many states have considered restrictive laws intended to make life so difficult for unauthorized immigrants that they would choose to leave the country. Arizona’s Senate Bill 1070, enacted in 2010, was a pioneering example of these efforts. Using population-level natality data and causal inference methods, we examined the effect of SB1070 on infants exposed before birth in Arizona. Prenatal exposure to the bill resulted in lower birth weight among Latina immigrant women, but not among US-born white, black, or Latina women. The decline in birth weight resulted from exposure to the bill being signed into law, rather than from its (limited) implementation. The findings indicate that the threat of a punitive law, even in the absence of implementation, can have a harmful effect on the birth outcomes of the next generation.",TRUE,FALSE,birth weight|immigrants|immigration policy|infant health|prenatal stress,2018-11-26T21:26:01.329723,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-11-26T21:25:52.347508,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Latina/o Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fw4er/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fw4er/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fw4er/citation/,fw4er,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fw4er/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/fc67v/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fw4er/relationships/node/,fc67v,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fw4er/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bfc2c21576a4f0017b394fd/,5bfc2c21576a4f0017b394fd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fw4er/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fw4er/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fw4er/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fw4er/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fw4er,https://doi.org/10.1093/aje/kwy218

The communal coping model suggests that families can mitigate shared risk of chronic disease through encouragement of healthful eating, eliciting preventive behaviors. 
Method: Using network data from 69 Australian families across three ancestry groups (Anglo, Italian, and Asian) with varied family health histories, the present study applied social network analysis to identify patterns of intergenerational encouragement of healthful eating behavior within families, and assess whether patterns varied by family ancestry or disease density.
Results: Findings indicated variation in patterns of health encouragement by ancestry such that Asian-Australian families were most distinct from the other ancestry groups. While there was no main effect of familial disease history, it moderated the effect of Italian ancestry on intergenerational encouragement patterns.  
Discussion: These results provide important context for future family-based interventions that leverage normative patterns of intergenerational exchange of encouragement or aim to modify such patterns in an effort to improve family health.",TRUE,FALSE,family networks|health encouragement|intergenerational relationships,2018-11-26T21:25:41.703379,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-11-26T21:25:16.836455,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/urv3m/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/urv3m/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/urv3m/citation/,urv3m,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/urv3m/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/dfyuv/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/urv3m/relationships/node/,dfyuv,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/urv3m/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bfc03aa1a972e001ac57454/,5bfc03aa1a972e001ac57454,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/urv3m/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/urv3m/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/urv3m/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/urv3m/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/urv3m,NA
