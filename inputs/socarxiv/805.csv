I offer as a detailed example one possible doctrinal response to the well-documented gender gap in patentable innovation.

Thus one is thus left to wonder what the Roslin opinion might have looked like had it been decided only a few weeks later, after the Alice decision was published, with the benefit of the Supreme Court's further direction on patentable subject matter.

Drawing on that analysis, I then use the Roslin case as a vehicle to highlight certain issues with the Supreme Court's current subject matter jurisprudence as applied to biotechnology.

With few exceptions, Durkheim assumed that criminal punishment is done on behalf of society. With the rise of prison privatization, this assumption is increasingly called into question. For-profit firms carrying out punishment, though legally agents of the state, are motivated by private gain. This article asks: How might privatization modify the functional effects of punishment?  It develops answers to this question by using insights from Durkheimian and neo-Durkheimian scholarship and the empirical case of modern privatized punishment in the United States. The article proposes three trajectories through which privatized punishment may (or may not) affect solidarity: Parity in Punishment, in which private and public punishers are seen as interchangeable; Public Interest, in which perceptions of greed and self-interest mar privatized punishment and sap it of its functional effects; and Sacred Transgressions, in which the private sector encroaches on sacred rites of punishment to the detriment of solidarity.",TRUE,FALSE,Durkheim|Preprint|privatization|punishment|socarxiv|theory,2018-07-02T10:51:02.527153,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-15T21:35:56.034000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hd4zu/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hd4zu/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hd4zu/citation/,hd4zu,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hd4zu/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/nr3c7/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hd4zu/relationships/node/,nr3c7,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hd4zu/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5789573d9ad5a101f2f5c399/,5789573d9ad5a101f2f5c399,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hd4zu/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hd4zu/requests/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hd4zu/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hd4zu/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hd4zu

Most discussions on the orphan works problem focus on the demand side: on users’ inability to locate owners. However, looking also at the supply side reveals that the problem of orphan works arises not only because users find it prohibitively costly to locate owners, but also because under a strict permission-first rule, copyright owners, who do not internalize the full social cost of forgone uses, face suboptimal incentives to maintain themselves locatable. However, in many cases copyright owners are usually the least-cost avoiders of the orphan works problem, and like in many other areas of law, should be encouraged to take steps to reduce the extent of the problem. Building on this insight, the article shows how considering the locatability of the owner of an infringed work at the remedy stage and tweaking the appropriate remedy will encourage owners to remain locatable, and why this solution is preferable to other proposed solutions. The article also discusses the tendency to treat the requirement to seek permission before using as a dogma, and why this dogmatic view of copyright impedes simple and efficient solutions and leads to adoption of grand solutions that are ineffective at best and harmful at worst.",TRUE,FALSE,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:49:08.443842,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-15T20:50:03.596000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fvgsd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fvgsd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fvgsd/citation/,fvgsd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fvgsd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/gd56w/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fvgsd/relationships/node/,gd56w,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fvgsd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57894c7d6c613b01f4347cf5/,57894c7d6c613b01f4347cf5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fvgsd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fvgsd/requests/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fvgsd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fvgsd/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fvgsd

While the doctrine has deep common law and statutory roots, its exact rationale and scope have never been fully explored and articulated. As a result, the law remains somewhat unsettled, in particular with respect to the ability of IP owners to opt-out of the doctrine and with respect to the applicability of the doctrine to situations of parallel importation.

This Article provides answers to these unsettled issues. By applying insights from the economics of post-sale restraints, the Article shows that the main benefits of post-sale restraints involve situations of imperfect vertical integration between coproducing or collaborating firms, which occur during the production and distribution phases or shortly thereafter. In such situations, opting out of the first sale doctrine should be permitted. Beyond such limited circumstances, however, the first sale doctrine promotes important social and economic goals: it promotes efficient long-term use and preservation of goods embodying IP and facilitates user-innovation.

According to conventional wisdom, the cost and delay involved in this process diminish the incentives to invest in the development of new drugs. Accordingly, several reforms aimed at restoring such incentives have been implemented and others have been advocated.

This paper challenges the central argument in the debate on the topic, namely that drug regulation and drug innovation are necessarily at odds with each other. Although intuitively appealing, the argument that drug regulation negatively affects the incentives to innovate does not fully capture the role that regulation plays in this industry. This paper shows that the regulatory framework is not solely a burden imposed on the industry; it also provides a valuable service to the industry.

Specifically, drug regulation provides certification of drug quality. Such certification, which may not be easily achieved by private market-based mechanisms, prevents the market from becoming a market for lemons. Therefore, rather than decreasing the expected returns to innovation, this aspect of regulation contributes to the value of new drugs and may actually encourage innovation.

It traces the shared common law origins of fair use and fair dealing in English and American copyright law, and shows that the enactment of the 1911 UK Copyright Act - the basis for current copyright laws of most Commonwealth jurisdictions - was not designed to cause any major alteration in the common law of fair dealing. The historical record shows that the distinction between US-style open-ended fair use and fair dealing as a myth: the codification of fair dealing in 1911 was not designed to limit its application to the enumerated purposes included in the statute.

The question of whether the list of enumerated purposes is exhaustive or, instead, illustrative of a broader principle has never been put squarely before the courts, let alone the higher courts, and certainly not in Canada. Therefore, the question of whether fair dealing in Canada can apply to purposes that are not explicitly mentioned in the Copyright Act is an open one, and as this Chapter shows, can and should be answered affirmatively. Doing so will not transplant a foreign legal concept. Rather, it will reunite present copyright doctrine with its rich and historic roots that were latent but never discarded.

While European antitrust regulation of refusal to license one's intellectual property does seem much more robust and activist than U.S. antitrust regulation of similar conduct, focusing solely on one narrow aspect of antitrust doctrine — the treatment of a unilateral refusal to deal — tells less than half the story.

Once various doctrines of copyright law are taken into account, the substantive difference between the European and American approaches not only narrows, but in some key respects is reversed. While European jurisdictions have relatively expansive copyright protection which may require antitrust intervention to check anti-competitive uses of copyrighted works, American copyright law provides stronger internal limits on copyright protection, which thereby lessens the need for resort to antitrust law as an external check on anti-competitive uses of copyrighted works. Furthermore, when the broader impact that antitrust law might have on the exercise of IPRs in the United States is considered (not only in substance, but also in antitrust process), it becomes apparent that in key respects, when innovative-competition is at stake, U.S. law grants overall weaker copyright protection than that available in Europe.

Working within this paradigm, this Article highlights that reducing search costs and providing incentives to maintain quality are related yet distinct functions and shows that recognizing their distinct nature enriches our understanding of trademark law. The Article first develops a distinction between two functions of trademarks: a linguistic and a trust functions. Then, the Article demonstrates how the distinction provides a matrix for evaluating the normative strength of various trademark rules and doctrines. Under this matrix, rules that promote both functions would be considered normatively strong; rules that promote neither function would be normatively weak; and rules that promote one function but not the other would be normatively ambiguous, their strength depending on the results of a closer cost-benefit analysis.",TRUE,FALSE,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:55:05.705888,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-15T20:38:36.752000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z94kq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z94kq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z94kq/citation/,z94kq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z94kq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/w3xwh/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z94kq/relationships/node/,w3xwh,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z94kq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/578949ce6c613b01f2347c74/,578949ce6c613b01f2347c74,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z94kq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z94kq/requests/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z94kq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/z94kq/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/z94kq

In this paper I examine the effects of military service on subsequent civic engagement. The key finding is that men who served in the US military prior to the advent of All-Volunteer Force (AVF) in 1973 are actually less civically engaged than those who never served. Military service has no significant effect on civic attitudes. These findings represent an especially powerful challenge to the notion that civic participation begets more civic participation. The fact that serving the citizenry through military duty actually decreases one’s subsequent civic involvement indicates that we cannot assume that all forms of civic activity are equally effective at inculcating their participants with civic values and habits. In fact, these findings indicate a need for a more refined conceptualization of the relationships between civic activity and future civic involvement.",TRUE,FALSE,civic engagement|military sociology|Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:53:48.459088,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-15T20:31:22.991000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wg4md/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wg4md/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wg4md/citation/,wg4md,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wg4md/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/pzr6a/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wg4md/relationships/node/,pzr6a,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wg4md/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57894825594d9001f4859e90/,57894825594d9001f4859e90,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wg4md/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wg4md/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wg4md/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wg4md/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wg4md
