Abstract:
Objective: To analyze the clinical characteristics of patients with novel coronavirus
pneumonia in Kunming City, and to study the correlation between nutritional status
and immune function.
Methods: Clinical data of 36 patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia in isolation
area of Kunming Third People's Hospital from January 31 to February 15, 2020 were
collected, and the basic situation, clinical characteristics, laboratory examination and
CT imaging characteristics were analyzed. Serum albumin (ALB), prealbumin (PAB),
hypersensitive c-reactive protein (hs-crp), CD3T cells, CD4T cells, CD8T cells and

Results: (1) The patients with new coronavirus pneumonia in Kunming were mainly
of common type. (2) 50% of the patients' first symptoms were fever and cough; (3)
The total number of white blood cells in peripheral blood was normal or decreased in
23 cases (79%), and the lymphocyte count decreased in 5 cases (13.89%), without
anemia. Hypersensitive c-reactive protein increased in 19 (52.78%) cases, and
procalcitonin increased in 1 case. Albumin decreased in 5 cases (13.89%),
proalbumin decreased in 15 cases (41.67%), alanine transaminase increased
slightly in 4 cases (11.11%), alanine transaminase increased slightly in 4 cases
(11.11%), total bilirubin increased slightly in 11 cases (30.56%), and renal
function and blood coagulation were normal. Absolute value of CD3+ T cells is
with a decrease in 21 cases (58.3%), CD4 +T in 28 cases (77.8%), CD8 +T in 17
cases (47.2%), and CD4+/ CD8 + inverse in 6 cases (16.7%). (4) The prealbumin,
CD3 T cells, CD4 T cells and CD8 T cells in the new coronavirus pneumonia
group were significantly lower than those in the normal control group, and the
hypersensitive c-reactive protein was higher than that in the normal control
group. (5) The levels of PAB in the serum of the patients were linearly
correlated with hs-crp, CD3 T cells, CD4 T cells and CD8 T cells, and the
correlation coefficients were -0.474, 0.558, 0.467 and 0.613, respectively,
showing statistical differences.
Conclusion: The clinical characteristics of the novel coronavirus pneumonia in
Kunming are different from those in Wuhan. The changes of serum proalbumin
and T cell subsets are relatively obvious. Changes in serum proalbumin may
contribute to the early warning of novel coronavirus pneumonia. The nutritional
status of patients with common and mild pneumonia should be considered.

INTRODUCTION
In December 2019, a new outbreak of coronavirus pneumonia began in Wuhan,
Hubei Province, and it quickly spread to the whole country, even many overseas

countries. According to the outbreak dynamics released by China, most of the cases
have come from Hubei, but outbreaks have been detected throughout the country. As
a place famous for tourism, Yunnan has a large number of imported cases, and the
incidence level is in the middle of the whole country. By the time of 24 o’clock on 15
February, a total of 169 cases were confirmed in Yunnan, including 49 in Kunming
City (8 cured and discharged). Recently, there have been a large number of articles on
novel coronavirus pneumonia, involving virus sequencing, clinical analysis and
epidemiological studies. Among them, the disease model of epidemic studies is used
to predict more. Those articles are mainly based on the data from Hubei, and there are
few clinical data from other imported areas. The Third People's Hospital of Kunming,
as a designated hospital for the treatment of the new coronavirus pneumonia in
Kunming, admitted about 3/4 of the patients diagnosed with the novel coronavirus
pneumonia in Kunming. Through clinical analysis, it is found that the clinical
characteristics of the pneumonia in Kunming are not exactly the same as the data
reported in Wuhan. The hospitalized patients in Kunming are mainly of normal type
and light type, and a small number of patients with severe or critical type recovered
relatively well. By 24:00 on February 17, 2020, there were no death cases. In our
clinical work, we found significant changes in patients' nutritional status, which may
be related to inflammation and immunity. This paper will analyze the clinical
characteristics of the new type of coronavirus pneumonia admitted to the Third
People's Hospital of Kunming City, and analyze the relationship between serum
proalbumin and T cells and its clinical significance.

1. Objects and Methods
1.1 Research Objects:
This study was approved by the ethics committee of The Third People's Hospital of
Kunming, and all data were used for clinical studies only, with the written consent of
patients and their guardians. According to the diagnosis and treatment scheme issued

by the National Health Commission of China , "the new coronavirus infection
pneumonia diagnosis and treatment plan (trial edition5), the diagnostic criteria for
new coronavirus pneumonia confirmed cases outside of Hubei province[1]: (1) The
history of epidemiology: 1) Within 14 days before the onset, there was a history of
traveling or living in the community of
pathological reported area

[1]

Wuhan city, surrounding areas, or other

2) Within 14 days before the onset, there was contact

history with cases of the new coronavirus infection (positive nucleic acid detection); 3)
Within 14 days before the onset, there was contact with the patient with fever or
respiratory symptoms from Wuhan, surrounding areas or from communities where
cases of the disease have been reported; 4) Aggregation of the disease. (2) Clinical
manifestations: 1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; 2) With the above imaging
characteristics of pneumonia; 3) The total number of early-onset white blood cells is
normal or decreased, or lymphocyte count decreased. Any case is with 1 condition in
the epidemiological history and conforms to any 2 in the clinical manifestations, or if
there is no clear history of epidemiology, and it conforms to 3 clinical manifestations,
the case can be diagnosed as suspected. Cases were included as suspected cases with
one of the following etiological evidence:(1) Real-time fluorescence rt-pcr of
respiratory tract specimens or hematological specimens was positive for new
coronavirus nucleic acid; (2) Viral genetic sequencing of respiratory or hematological
specimens, is highly homologous with known novel coronaviruses. Futhermore,
patients were included in the inclusion criteria, when the following 2 criteria were met:
(1) Suspected cases of new coronavirus pneumonia; (2) Real-time fluorescence rt-pcr
was performed on respiratory specimens to detect positive nucleic acid of novel
coronavirus. Clinical data were collected from 36 patients with novel coronavirus
pneumonia who met the criteria above in the isolation area of Kunming Third People's
hospital from January 26 to February 15, 2020. The normal control group came from
healthy people in the physical examination center.

1.2. Clinical Classification of Disease Severity:

On admission, the diagnosed patients were clinically classified according to the
"pneumonia diagnosis and treatment plan for new coronavirus infection (trial version
5)", as follows: (1) Mild type: with mild clinical symptoms, and without imaging
finding of pneumonia (2) Common type: with fever, respiratory tract and other
symptoms, and with imaging finding of pneumonia; (3) Severe type: accord with any
of the following: 1) Respiratory distress, respiratory rate (RR) ≥30 times/min; 2) In
resting state, oxygen saturation ≤93%; 3) Partial arterial oxygen pressure
(PaO)/oxygen absorption concentration (FiO) ≤300mmHg (1mmHg= 0.133kpa);22 (4)
Critical type: meet one of the following conditions: 1) Respiratory failure occurs, and
mechanical ventilation is required; 2) Shock;3) Complicated with other organ failure
and requiring intensive care of ICU unit.

1.3.Statistical processing:
SPSS 20.0 software was used for data analysis. Case or rate were used for data
counting, and χ2 test was used for inter-group comparison; The measurement data of
normal distribution were expressed as x±s, and the measurement data of non-normal
distribution were expressed as median (quartile spacing). The measurement data of
normal distribution was verified with t-test or analysis of variance, and the rank sum
test was used for inter-group comparison of non-normal distribution. The relationship
between PAB and T cell subsets and hs-crp was analyzed by regression, and the
scatter plot was made by simple linear regression and the regression equation was
calculated. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

were admitted to the ICU One of the two patients admitted to ICU got better on the
17th day after admission, getting out of the critical condition patient was in critical
condition on the 17th day after admission, and the other one patient, with stable
condition, needs to be treated continuously,. The patients transferred to ICU are in
stable condition. The rest are still in hospital and in stable condition.

1. Discussion
This paper is the first reported clinical study in a non-Hubei study in China.
There are several differences, compared with the clinical analysis results reported by
Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital and Tongji Hospital Affiliated to Tongji Medical College
of Huazhong University of Science and Technology (refer to as Tongji Hospital
Affiliated hereafter). Only 2 of the 36 cases included in this study were assessed as
critical on admission, while the rest of the cases were mainly of normal type and not
severe.[2][3] On admission, 50% of the patients had fever and cough as their first
symptoms, mainly moderate and low fever, with few gastrointestinal symptoms. In
this study, the lymphocyte absolute value reduction is only in 5 cases (13.9%),
hypersensitive c-reactive protein increased in 19 (52.78%), significantly lower
than the 69% and 93% reported by Tongji Hospital Affiliated s, or less than 35%
and 86% of the Jinyintan Hospital reports respectively. That may be involved
with the fact that this study is mainly based on the common type and mild type.
The changes of lymphocyte absolute value and hypersensitive c-reactive protein
in patients with the common and mild cases of the new coronavirus pneumonia
are not as evident as those in the severe and critical cases, which can be easily
ignored during clinical observation. In this study, we found a decrease in
prealbumin in 15 cases (41.67%), and no previous studies have reported
prealbumin changes. Prealbumin is usually used in clinical evaluation of the
nutritional status of the body, and the half-life of serum prealbumin is short, so
its changes may occur before albumin. In this study, there were only 5 patients
with decreased albumin, all of which were with a slight decrease, but 14

patients (41.67% showed decreased prealbumin. The pulmonary CT findings of
the patients were basically consistent with previous reports. Twenty-two
(61.11%) of the patients showed abnormal findings, with ground glass density
shadows.

Our study suggests that patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia
experience a decrease in t-cell subsets on admission, and in combination with
clinical typing, we speculate that immune function may be suppressed or
impaired in the early stage of the disease. As a commonly used indicator to
evaluate nutritional status in clinical practice, prealbumin is often utilized to
evaluate tumor and postoperative recovery [4] . Domestic scholar CAI Chuanqi et
al. [5] found that hypoalbuminemia is an independent risk factor for the severity
of disease in elderly pneumonia patients. This study found that the albumin in
the disease group was basically normal, while the prealbumin was significantly
lower than that in the normal control group. We analyzed the relationship
between prealbumin and CD3 +T cells, CD4 +T cells and CD8 + T cells
respectively. The regression model showed that there is a linear and positive
correlation between the level of prealbumin in the serum of patients and CD3 +T
cells, CD4 +T cells and CD8+T cells, with the strongest correlation among
CD8 +T cells. Proalbumin is an acute reactive protein synthesized by liver cells
with a half-life of 19 days

[6]

. In the early stage of the disease, proalbumin

changes, which may be caused by the consumption of proalbumin by the body
after infection with the virus, leading to the reduction of proalbumin in
peripheral blood. Recent studies have found that inflammation is an effective
inhibitor of protein synthesis, and it may also inhibit the synthesis of visceral
prealbumin during the occurrence and development of the disease, leading to a
low level of prealbumin [7]. Due to fever and infection, the body is in a state of
high decomposition and high energy demand. If at the same time with lack of
energy and loss of appetite, the patient cannot ensure sufficient food intake
through the mouth to meet the needs of the body. Meanwhile if combined with
basic diseases of other viscera, moderate or severe malnutrition can easily
appear in pneumonia patients. Clinical studies have found that malnutrition
rates in patients with severe pneumonia are as high as 60%, with immune
dysfunction. Enteral nutrition or other forms of nutritional support are usually
provided only to patients with severe pneumonia. Good nutritional status not

only reflects the body's immune function to a certain extent, but also may play
an irreplaceable role in fighting the emerging inflammatory storm. Prealbumin
can be used as an early warning indicator of immune function in patients with
new coronavirus pneumonia. Through the analysis of the relationship between
prealbumin and T cell subsets, the decreased value of prealbumin indicates that
the patient's cellular immune function is impaired, which plays a certain role in
clinical condition monitoring.
According to the current outbreak reports, most of the patients are mild
and normal type. In this study, we concluded that lymphocyte changes are not
significant in the early stage of the disease in both normal and mild patients,
and that changes in t-cell subsets and prealbumin might be beneficial for
evaluating the disease.
