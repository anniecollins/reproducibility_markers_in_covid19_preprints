Abstract
Background In December 2019, novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infected pneumonia
occurred in Wuhan, China. The number of cases has increased rapidly but information on the
clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia without comorbidities compared to
normal controls in Chinese Han population is limited. Our objective is to describe the
epidemiological

and

clinical

characteristics

of

SARS-CoV-2

pneumonia

without

comorbidities compared to normal controls in the Chinese Han population.
Methods Retrospective, multi-center case series of the 69 consecutive hospitalized patients
with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, from February 7 to February 28, 2020; final date
of follow-up was February 29, 2020.
Results The study population included 69 hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2
pneumonia without comorbidities and 14,117 normal controls. 50.7% patients were male and
49.3% were female; 1.5% patients were asymptomatic cases, 63.8% patients were mild cases,
and 36.2% patients were severe or critical cases. Compared with mild patients (n=44), severe
or critical patients (n=25) were significantly older (median age, 67 years [IQR, 58-79] vs. 49
years [IQR, 36-60]; p<0.01). Fever was present in 98.6% of the patients. The second most
common symptom was cough (62.3%), fatigue (58.0%), sputum (39.1%), and headache
(33.3%). The median incubation period was 4 days (IQR, 2 to 7). Leukocyte count was
74.1% of normal controls and lymphocyte count was 45.9% of normal controls. The
phenomenon of lymphocyte depletion (PLD) observed in severe or critical cases in 100%.
Levels of lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer, procalcitonin, and interleukin-6 were showed
significant differences between mild and severe or critical cases. Chest computed
tomographic scans showed bilateral patchy patterns (49.3%), local patchy shadowing (29.0%),
and ground glass opacity (21.7%). 7.3% patients were diagnosed ARDS, 7.3% patients were
diagnosed acute cardiac injury (troponin I >28 pg/mL) and 4.4% patients were diagnosed
fungal infections or shock. 4.3% patients have been discharged; 1.5% patient had died; 1.5%
patient had recovery.

Introduction
In December 2019, a cluster of acute respiratory illness, now known as SARS-CoV-2
pneumonia, occurred in Wuhan, China.1-5 The disease has rapidly spread from Wuhan to
other areas. As of February 11, 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention
(China CDC) has officially reported that there are 2.0% (889) asymptomatic cases, 2.3%
(1,023) death cases, and 80.9% mild cases among 44,672 confirmed cases. 51.4%
(22,981) were male and 48.6% (21,691) were female. 6

In January, 2020, the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was identified in samples of
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from a patient in Wuhan and was confirmed as the cause of the
SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.1,2 Full-genome sequencing and phylogenic analysis indicated that
SARS-CoV-2 is a distinct clade from the betacoronaviruses associated with human severe
acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). 1,2

COVID-19 has spread rapidly since it was first identified in Wuhan and has been shown to
have a wide spectrum of severity. Recently, a report shows that SARS-CoV and
SARS-CoV-2 shared the same functional host-cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2
(ACE2).7 Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 receptors in 10-20 fold higher affinity
than SARS-CoV binds to the same receptors.7 Another report shows SARS-CoV-2 cell entry
depends on ACE2 and TMPRSS2.8 Since ACE2 receptors on lung alveolar epithelial cells
and enterocytes of the small intestine are dominant, lung alveolar epithelial cells or
enterocytes of the small intestine may be an important susceptibility factor for human.9
According to World Health Organization interim guidance on January 12, 2020,
SARS-CoV-2 infection is classified as asymptomatic case, mild and severe cases of
pneumonia, and critical cases of pneumonia (ARDS, sepsis, septic shock). Severe cases of
pneumonia are defined as patients with respiratory rate > 30 breaths/min, severe respiratory
distress, or SpO2 < 90% on room air.10 Asymptomatic case has been reported in China and
Germany.11,12 Huang et al3 first reported 41 cases of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in which most
patients had a history of exposure to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. Organ dysfunction

(shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS], acute cardiac injury, and acute kidney
injury, etc.) and death can occur in severe or critical cases. Guan et al4 reported findings from
1099 cases of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and the results suggested that the SARS-CoV-2
infection clustered within groups of humans in close contact, and was more likely to affect
older men with comorbidities. However, the full spectrum of disease without comorbidities or
related to cellular immune functions is not yet known. The objective of this case series was to
describe the clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia without comorbidities
compared to 14,117 normal controls in Chinese Han population.
Methods
Study Design and Participants
This multicentre, retrospective study was done at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University,
Chinese PLA General Hospital, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, and affiliated
hospitals of Shanghai University of Medicine & Health Sciences. This case series was
approved by the institutional ethics board of Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University (No.
2020020) and Peking Union Medical College Hospital (ZS-1830). We extracted 1532 case
data from China CDC in Shanghai (338 cases), Beijing (414 cases), and Wuhan (780 cases)
with clinical confirmed COVID-19. 1463 cases with comorbidities were excluded, including
cardiovascular diseases (307 cases), hypertension (258 cases), chronic gastrointestinal
diseases (126 cases)，chronic renal diseases (125 cases), diabetes (122 cases), chronic
obstructive pulmonary diseases (105 cases), hepatitis B carriers (95 cases), depression (74
cases), autoimmune diseases (73 cases), tumors (21 cases) and other diseases (157 cases). All
69 consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19 without comorbidities from February 7 to
February 28, 2020 and 14,117 normal controls without comorbidities from health checkup
(from November 2018 to November 2019, before COVID-19 outbreak) in Chinese PLA
General Hospital, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan
University, and affiliated hospitals of Shanghai University of Medicine & Health Sciences
were retrospectively enrolled. To reduce the impact of comorbidities on our research, all
patients with comorbidities described above were excluded from the study. Identification of
patients was achieved by reviewing and analyzing available electronic medical records and

patient care resources. Written informed consent was waived due to the rapid emergence of
this infectious disease. We retrospectively analyzed patients according to WHO interim
guidance.13 Laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection was performed as previously
described.14
All patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia enrolled in this study were diagnosed according to
World Health Organization interim guidance.13 According to World Health Organization
interim guidance on January 12, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 infection is classified as asymptomatic
cases, mild and severe cases of pneumonia, and critical cases of pneumonia (ARDS, sepsis,
septic shock). Severe case of pneumonia is defined as patients with respiratory rate > 30
breaths/min, severe respiratory distress, or SpO2 < 90% on room air.10 Clinical outcomes
(discharges, mortality, and recovery, etc.) were monitored up to February 29, 2020, the final
date of follow-up. Cardiac injury was defined if the serum levels of cardiac biomarkers (eg,
troponin I) were above the 99th percentile upper reference limit (>28 pg/mL) or new
abnormalities were shown in electrocardiography and echocardiography.3
Real-Time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction Assay for SARS-CoV-2
A confirmed case of COVID-19 is defined as a positive result on high throughput sequencing
or real-time reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay of pharyngeal
swab specimens. Samples were collected for extracting SARS-CoV-2 RNA from patients
suspected of having SARS-CoV-2 infection as described previously.14 In brief, the pharyngeal
swabs were placed into a collection tube with 150 μL of virus preservation solution, and total
RNA was extracted within 2 hours using the respiratory sample RNA isolation kit. Forty μL
of cell lysates were transferred into a collection tube followed by vortex for 10 seconds. After
standing at room temperature for 10 minutes, the collection tube was centrifugated at 1000
rpm/min for 5 minutes. The suspension was used for RT-PCR assay of SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
Two target genes, including open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab) and nucleocapsid protein (N),
were simultaneously amplified and tested during the real-time RT-PCR assay. Target 1

using a SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection kit. Reaction mixture contains 12 μL of reaction
buffer, 4 μL of enzyme solution, 4 μL of probe primers solution, 3 μL of diethyl
pyrocarbonate–treated water, and 2 μL of RNA template. RT-PCR assay was performed
under the following conditions: incubation at 50 °C for 15 minutes and 95 °C for 5 minutes,
40 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 15 seconds, and extending and collecting fluorescence
signal at 55 °C for 45 seconds. A cycle threshold value (Ct-value) less than 37 was defined as
a positive test result, and a Ct-value of 40 or more was defined as a negative test. These
diagnostic criteria were based on the recommendation by the National Institute for Viral
Disease Control and Prevention (China). A medium load, defined as a Ct-value of 37 to less
than 40, required confirmation by retesting. Only RT-PCR confirmed cases were included in
the analysis.
Flow Cytometry Data Analysis
All antibodies were obtained from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA, USA). Two 100-μL
samples of blood were placed in two tubes for staining according to mmanufacturer’s manual.
After this procedure, 1 mL of red-cell lyses buffer was added to each tube and incubated for
10 minutes and then washed with Sorvall cell washer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham,
MA, USA). Cells were then resuspended in 350 μL of phosphate-buffered saline and acquired
with the use of FACSCanto™ flow cytometry; daily quality control and assurance were
carried out with the use of seven-color setup beads (BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA, USA).

Statistical Analysis
Categorical variables were described as frequency rates and percentages, and continuous
variables were described using mean, median, and interquartile range (IQR) values. Means
for continuous variables were compared using independent group t tests when the data were
normally distributed; otherwise, the Mann-Whitney test was used. Data (non-normal

distribution) from repeated measures were compared using the generalized linear mixed
model. Proportions for categorical variables were compared using the χ2 test, although the
Fisher exact test was used when the data were limited. All statistical analyses were performed
using SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) version 13.0 software (SPSS Inc).
For unadjusted comparisons, a 2-sided α of less than 0.05 was considered statistically
significant. The analyses have not been adjusted for multiple comparisons and, given the
potential for type I error, the findings should be interpreted as exploratory and descriptive.
Because the cohort of patients in our study was not derived from random selection, all
statistics are deemed to be descriptive only.

Results
Presenting Characteristics
The study population included 69 hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2
pneumonia without comorbidities and 14,117 normal controls. 50.7% patients were male and
49.3% were female; 1.5% patients were asymptomatic cases, 63.8% (44/69) patients were
mild cases, and 36.2% (25/69) patients were severe or critical cases. Compared with mild
patients (n=44), severe or critical patients (n=25) were significantly older (median age, 67
years [IQR, 58-79] vs. 49 years [IQR, 36-60]; p<0.01). Fever was present in 98.6% of the
patients. The second most common symptom was cough (62.3%), fatigue (58.0%), sputum
(39.1%), and headache (33.3%). Less common symptoms were chill, sore throat, shortness of
breath, anorexia, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting (Table 1). The median incubation period was
4 days (IQR, 2 to 7). On admission, the degree of severity of COVID-19 was categorized as
mild in 44 patients and severe or critical in 25 patients. Compared with mild patients (n=44),
severe or critical patients (n=25) were significantly older (median age, 67 years [IQR, 58-79]
vs. 49 years [IQR, 36-60]; p<0.01) (Table 1).

The COVID-19 mortality rate in China is 2.3%.6 However, the mortality rate is 4.6% (2,282
death cases in 49,540 confirmed cases）in Wuhan, 1.9% (8 death cases in 414 confirmed
cases) in Beijing, and 0.9% (3 death cases in 338 confirmed cases) in Shanghai based on
China CDC official report on February 29, 2020. Our findings showed that the levels of

lymphocytes were 0.8（IQR, 0.6-1.1）109/L in Wuhan, 1.0（IQR, 0.7-1.4）109/L in Beijing,
and 1.1 (IQR, 0.8-1.5) 109/L in Shanghai before admission to hospitals, respectively,
indicating that cellular immune function related to the severity of disease. Our previous report
shows that neutrophils increase in non-survivors on day 11 and day 17, whereas, lymphocytes
decrease in non-survivors on day 11 and day 17 significantly (p < 0.05) indicating cellular
immunity related to mortality.14

In 69 patients, there was an asymptomatic case in admission and the patient developed
symptom 3 days after positive RT-PCR test.

Radiologic and Laboratory Parameters in Mild and Severe or Critical Patients
The radiologic and laboratory findings were showed (Table 1). These data could helpfully
distinguish between mild and severe or critical patients. All of the 69 enrolled patients
showed bilateral patchy patterns, or ground-glass opacity, or local patchy shadowing of chest
CT scan. (Table 1, Figure 1). On admission, the predominant pattern of abnormality observed
was bilateral patchy patterns (49.3%), local patchy shadowing (29.0%), and ground glass
opacity (21.7%).

Due to lack of reference ranges for blood routine and lymphocytes of normal Chinese Han
population, we systematically analyzed the 14,117 healthy adult Chinese Han people of 18-86
years old and classified them as an age group every 10 years for the convenience of other
researchers in the future (Table 2).

The reference ranges of blood routine are as followings (Table 2): white blood cell (4.83-6.50,
109/L), lymphocyte (1.5-2.4, 109/L), hemoglobin (140-154, g/L), platelet (189-236, 109/L),
alanine aminotransferase (14-18, U/L), aspartate aminotransferase (17-21, U/L), creatinine
(63-70, μmol/L), C-reactive protein (0.09-0.12, mg/L), and lactate dehydrogenase (142-165,
U/L).

On admission, leucocytes were no difference between mild and severe or critical cases (Table
1). However, the patient's leukocyte count was 74.1% (4.3/5.8) of the median value in normal
controls (Table 1, Table 2). Neutrophils and lymphocytes showed significant difference (p <
0.05) between mild and severe or critical cases (Table 1). In addition, the patient's
lymphocyte count was 45.9% (0.9/1.959) of the median value in normal controls (Table 1,
Table 2).

The phenomenon of lymphocyte depletion (PLD) observed in severe or critical cases (Table
3). As the disease progressed and clinical status deteriorated, the levels of lymphocytes
progressively decreased before death. Further analyzing 69 cases of lymphocyte subsets
showed that CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes have significant difference (p < 0.01) between
mild and severe or critical cases (Table 4).

Our findings also show significant differences (p < 0.05) in lactate dehydrogenase, troponin I,
D-dimer, procalcitonin, and interleukin-6 (IL6) between mild and severe or critical cases
(Table 1). Levels of aspartate aminotransferase of patients were elevated in comparison with
normal controls. The levels of C reaction protein (CRP) were 121-fold higher than the value
in normal controls, however, no difference observed between mild and severe or critical cases
(Table 1, Table 2). There are 3.6% patients with acute kidney injury, however, no difference
observed between mild and severe cases.14 There is no acute kidney injury since serum
creatinine level is within a normal range (Table 1, Table 2), indicating that patients with
comorbidities might prone to acute kidney injury. 14

All patients were tested for nine respiratory pathogens, the nucleic acid of influenza viruses A
and B. We did not find other respiratory viruses in any of the patients. Three cases of fungal
infections were diagnosed as Candida albicans.

Main Interventions and Outcomes
All patients were treated in isolation. 38 (55.1%) patients received antiviral treatment,
including oseltamivir (75 mg every 12 h, orally). 31 (44.9%) patients were treated with

antibiotics. The antibiotics used generally covered mild pathogens and some atypical
pathogens; when secondary bacterial infection occurred, medication was administered
according to the results of bacterial culture and drug sensitivity. The antibiotics used were

methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, as well as antifungal drugs. Six patients
significantly increased in IL6 were also treated with methylprednisolone. Three patients used
non-invasive ventilator mechanical ventilation. Two patients used an invasive ventilator to
assist ventilation. The ventilator adopted P-SIMV mode, the inhaled oxygen concentration
was 35–100%, and the positive end-expiratory pressure was 6–12 cm H2O. No patients were
treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Moreover, 7.3% patients were
diagnosed ARDS, 7.3% patients were diagnosed acute cardiac injury (troponin I>28 pg/mL)
and 4.4% patients were diagnosed fungal infections or shock (Table 1).

By the end of February 29, three (4.3%) patients have been discharged; one (1.5%) patient
had died; one (1.5%) patient had recovery; 64 patients were still in hospital (Table 1). Among
the 25 patients with severe or critical disease, a primary composite end-point event occurred
in 5 patients (20.0%), including 12.0% who were underwent non-invasive mechanical
ventilation, 8.0% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 4.0% who died (Table
1).

Discussion
This report, to our knowledge, is the first retrospective multicenter study of COVID-19 with
normal controls. The study population included 69 hospitalized COVID-19 patients without
comorbidities and 14,117 normal controls. 50.7% patients were male and 49.3% were female;
1.5% patients were asymptomatic cases, 63.8% patients were mild cases, and 36.2% patients
were severe or critical cases. The median incubation period was 4 days (IQR, 2 to 7). The
median age of the patients was 57 years (IRQ, 43 to 69); 39.1% of the patients were older
than 60 years of age. Fever was present in 98.6% of the patients. The second most common
symptom was cough (62.3%), fatigue (58.0%), sputum (39.1%), and headache (33.3%). Less
common symptoms were chill, sore throat, shortness of breath, anorexia, diarrhea, nausea,

and vomiting (Table 1). On admission, the degree of severity of COVID-19 was categorized
as mild in 44 patients and severe or critical in 25 patients. Compared with mild patients
(n=44), severe or critical patients (n=25) were significantly older (median age, 67 years [IQR,
58-79] vs. 49 years [IQR, 36-60]; p<0.01). There is no acute kidney injury since serum
creatinine level is within a normal range (Table 1, Table 2), indicating that patients with
comorbidities might prone to acute kidney injury. 14

For the asymptomatic case, we speculate that the patient is currently taking HIV medications
and the medication is interfering with the results of RT-PCR. Further research and
observation are needed.

Our findings included the PLD at presentation were associated with the severity of disease.
The severe PLD or the acquired immunodeficiency (CD4 lymphocytes are below 200
cells/mm3) is common in HIV patients. When CD4 lymphocytes are below 200 cells/mm3,
clinicians might pay attention to fungal infections. There were three cases of fungal infections
seen in our study indicating the lymphocyte depletion associated with fungal infections
(Table 1, Table 3) as patients with T cell depletion have increased susceptibility to fungal
infections.15,16 Our findings also show significant differences (p < 0.01) in IL6 and D-dimer
between mild and severe or critical groups, suggesting that IL6 and D-dimer are important
parameters for the severity of disease (Table 1).

It has been reported that SARS-CoV directly infects monocytes, macrophages and T
lymphocytes in human.17 The PLD may also be secondary to activation of T lymphocytes.18
COVID-19 has spread rapidly since it was first identified in Wuhan and has been shown to
have a wide spectrum of severity as SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 receptors in 10-20 fold
higher affinity than SARS-CoV binds to the same receptors.7,19 The report shows
SARS-CoV-2 cell entry depends on ACE2 and TMPRSS2.8 Therefore, it is necessary to
further study whether lymphocytes have ACE2 receptor and TMPRSS2 expression during the
developmental stage since the PLD exists. A SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay for lymphocyte
subsets in severe or critical cases should be followed up. Our findings also suggest that

lymphocyte subsets should be analyzed at admission immediately no matter how COVID-19
affected lymphocytes through directly or indirectly. When patients are confirmed as
COVID-19, clinicians should order tests for lymphocyte subsets in order to intervene early in
the consequences of the PLD.
This study has several limitations. First, only 69 cases were included. However, this report is
the first multicenter study of SARS-CoV-2 infection without comorbidities and 14,117
normal controls were analyzed. Through this report, a larger multicenter cohort study can be
introduced in the future. Second, among the 69 cases, most patients are still hospitalized at
the time of manuscript submission. Therefore, it is difficult to assess all risk factors for poor
outcome. Third, the assay of IgG and IgM antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in serum is not
available yet. Fourth, the clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia of 2019 in
Wuhan and SARS-CoV pneumonia of 2003 in Beijing should be compared and studied. 20
Fifth, the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infecting the lungs and intestines through the
ACE2 receptor and TMPRSS2 or the acquired immunodeficiency (CD4 cells below 200
cells/mm3) associated with COVID-19 (the severe or critical cases) seen in some patients
directly or indirectly caused by SARS-CoV-2 is not understood, and further research and
observation are needed.
Conclusions
In this multicenter case series of 69 patients without comorbidities, the full spectrum of
asymptomatic, mild, severe, and critical cases is described. 50.7% patients were male and
49.3% were female; 1.5% patients were asymptomatic cases, 63.8% patients were mild cases,
and 36.2% patients were severe or critical cases. 4.3% patients have been discharged; 1.5%
patient had died; 1.5% patient had recovery. Among the 25 patients with severe or critical
disease, 12.0% patients were underwent non-invasive mechanical ventilation, 8.0% patients
underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 4.0% patients died.
