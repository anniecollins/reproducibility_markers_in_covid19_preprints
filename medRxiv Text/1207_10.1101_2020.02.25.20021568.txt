Abstract

46

Background: Computed tomography (CT) is the preferred imaging method for diagnosing 2019

47

novel coronavirus (COVID19) pneumonia. Our research aimed to construct a system based on

48

deep learning for detecting COVID-19 pneumonia on high resolution CT, relieve working

49

pressure of radiologists and contribute to the control of the epidemic.

50

Methods: For model development and validation, 46,096 anonymous images from 106 admitted

51

patients, including 51 patients of laboratory confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and 55 control

52

patients of other diseases in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University (Wuhan, Hubei province,

53

China) were retrospectively collected and processed. Twenty-seven consecutive patients

54

undergoing CT scans in Feb, 5, 2020 in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University were prospectively

55

collected to evaluate and compare the efficiency of radiologists against 2019-CoV pneumonia

56

with that of the model.

57

Findings: The model achieved a per-patient sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 93.55%, accuracy

58

of 95.24%, PPV of 84.62%, and NPV of 100%; a per-image sensitivity of 94.34%, specificity of

59

99.16%, accuracy of 98.85%, PPV of 88.37%, and NPV of 99.61% in retrospective dataset. For 27

60

prospective patients, the model achieved a comparable performance to that of expert radiologist.

61

With the assistance of the model, the reading time of radiologists was greatly decreased by 65%.

62

Conclusion: The deep learning model showed a comparable performance with expert radiologist,

63

and greatly improve the efficiency of radiologists in clinical practice. It holds great potential to

64

relieve the pressure of frontline radiologists, improve early diagnosis, isolation and treatment, and

65

thus contribute to the control of the epidemic.

Introduction

68

In December 2019, a new coronavirus infection disease (hereinafter referred to as COVID-19) was

69

first reported in Wuhan. Subsequently, the outbreak began to spread widely in China and even

70

abroad.[1-3]

71

The clinical manifestations of the COVID-19 pneumonia is complicated and could be

72

characterized as fever, cough, myalgia, headache, and gastrointestinal symptoms onset.[4]

73

Although the nucleic acid detection was considered determinant for identifying the COVID-19

74

infection and more rapid detection kit for the novel coronavirus has come into mass production,

75

computed tomography (CT) scan is still the most efficient modality for detecting and evaluating

76

the severity of pneumonia.[5] An update series demonstrate that CT findings were positive in all

77

140 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients, even in the early stage.[4,6] In the fifth version of

78

diagnostic manual of COVID-19 launched by the National Health and Health Commission of

79

China, the radiographic characteristics of pneumonia was included the clinical diagnostic standard

80

in Hubei Province.[7] Subsequently, 14,840 new cases of COVID-19 were reported within one

81

day on Feb 13, 2020 in Wuhan, including 13332 cases of clinical diagnoses.[8] This highlighted

82

the importance of CT in the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia.

83

Due to the outbreak of the COVID-19, thousands of patients waited in line for CT

84

examination in the designated fever outpatient hospital at Wuhan and other cities. As of Feb 14,

85

there are 5,534 suspected cases, 38,107 confirmed patients receiving treatment in hospital, and

86

77,323 cases under medical observation in Hubei province.[9] Most of them need to undergo CT

87

examination, however, there are less than 4,500 radiologists in cities of Hubei according to the

88

China Health Statistical Yearbook (2018).[10] Meanwhile, because the lung infection foci are

89

small in the early stage of the COVID-19 infection, thinner layer (2.5mm, 1.25mm or even

90

0.625mm) scanning were usually needed instead of conventional CT scan (5 mm) for diagnosis,

91

which would be more time-consuming. All these made radiologists overloaded, delay the

92

diagnosis and isolation of patients, affect patient’s treatment and prognosis, and ultimately, affect

93

the control of COVID-19 epidemic.

94

Deep learning, an important breakthrough in the domain of AI in the past decade, has huge

95

potential at extracting tiny features in image analysis.[11] Our group also succeeded in recruiting

96

this technique in minor lesion detection and real-time assistance to doctors in gastrointestinal

97

endoscopy.[12-16]

98

In the present research, we construct and validate a system based on deep learning for

99

identification of viral pneumonia on CT. Our model has comparable performance with expert

100

radiologist, but take much less time.

101
102

Method

103

Patients

104

We first retrospectively collected 46,096 anonymous images from 106 admitted patients, including

105

51 patients of laboratory confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and 55 control patients of other

106

diseases in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University (Wuhan, Hubei province, China) for model

107

development. The patients’ CT scan images and reports, history, clinical manifestations, physical

108

findings, and viral pathogen results were all collected. For prospective patients, 27 consecutive

109

patients undergoing CT scans were enrolled in the designated CT rooms in Feb 5, 2020 in Renmin

110

Hospital of Wuhan University.

111

This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University.

112

Written informed consent was provided by all prospective participants. Because of virus

113

contamination, the signed informed consents were carefully sealed and kept in the specific place

114

according to the Law of the People's Republic of China on Infectious Disease Prevention and

115

Control.[17] For patients whose CT scans were stored in the retrospective databases, informed

116

consent was waived by the Ethics Committee.

117
118

Diagnostic testing for COVID-19

119

Patient's respiratory secretions were collected and transferred to a sterile test tube with a virus

120

transport medium. Fluorescent RT-PCR analysis of samples was performed using the COVID-19

121

nucleic acid detection kit developed by Shanghai Geneodx Biotechnology Co., Ltd. This detection

122

kit was approved by the US National Drug Administration (NMPA) on January 26, 2019 and

123

recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).[18] The rapid,

124

high-precision COVID-19 detection kit greatly accelerated the confirmation of human COVID-19

125

infection.

126
127

Datasets

128

As shown in Figure 1, a total of 46,096 CT scan images from 51 COVID-19 pneumonia patients

129

and 55 control patients of other disease were collected for developing the model to detect

130

COVID-19 pneumonia. After filtering those images without good lung fields, 35355 images were

131

selected and split into training and retrospectively testing datasets. Enrolled images in training

132

dataset covered almost all common CT features of COVID19 pneumonia, as presented in Figure 2.

133

Three radiologists with more than 5 years of clinical experience labelled infection lesions of

134

COVID-19 pneumonia patients in training dataset, and selected images containing COVID19

135

pneumonia lesions in testing set, and their labels were combined by consensus. For prospectively

136

testing the model, 13,911 images of 27 consecutive patients undergoing CT scans in Feb 5, 2020

137

in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University were further collected. All CT scans were obtained in

138

Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. The instruments used in this study included Optima CT680,

139

Revolution CT and Bright Speed CT scanner (all GE Healthcare).

140
141

Training algorithm

142

UNet++, a novel and powerful architecture for medical image segmentation was implemented to

143

develop the model.[19,20] We first trained UNet++ to extract valid areas in CT images using 289

144

randomly selected CT images and tested it in other 600 randomly selected CT images. The

145

training images were labelled with the smallest rectangle containing all valid areas by researchers.

146

The model successfully extracted valid areas in 600 images in testing set with an accuracy of

147

100%. For detecting suspicious lesions on CT scans, 691 images of COVID-19 pneumonia

148

infection lesions labelled by radiologists and 300 images randomly selected from patients of

149

non-COVID-19 pneumonia were used. Taking the raw CT scan images as input with a resolution

150

of 512×512, and the labelled map from the expert as output, UNet++ was used to train in Keras in

151

an image-to-image manner. The suspicious region was predicted under a confidence cutoff value

152

of 0.50, and a prediction box pixel of over 25. The training curves of UNet++ for extracting valid

153

areas and detecting suspicious lesions in CT images were shown in Supplementary Figure 1 and

154

Supplementary Figure 2, respectively. The prediction schematic of the model was shown in

155

Figure 3. Raw images were firstly input into the model, and after processing of the model,

156

prediction boxes framing suspicious lesions were output. Valid areas were further extracted and

157

unnecessary fields were filter out to avoid possible false positives. To predict by case, a logic

158

linking the prediction results of consecutive images was added. CT images with the above

159

prediction results were divided into four quadrants, and results would be output only when three

160

consecutive images were predicted to have lesions in the same quadrant.

161
162

Testing of the model in retrospective data

163

To evaluate the performance of the model on CT scan images, five metrics including the accuracy,

164

sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV were calculated as follows: accuracy = true predictions/total

165

number of cases, sensitivity = true positive/positive, specificity = true negative/negative, positive

166

prediction value (PPV) = true positive/(true positive + false positive), negative prediction value

167

(NPV) = true negative/(true negative + false negative). The “true positive” is the number of

168

correctly predicted COVID-19 pneumonia cases/images, “false positive” is the number of

169

mistakenly predicted COVID-19 pneumonia cases/images, “positive” is the number of

170

cases/images of COVID-19 pneumonia patients, “true negative” is the number of correctly

171

predicted non-COVID-19 pneumonia cases/images, “false negative” is the number of mistakenly

172

predicted non-COVID-19 pneumonia cases/images and ‘negative’ is the number of

173

non-COVID-19 pneumonia cases/images enrolled. For image-based metrics, 636 images

174

containing infection lesions identified by radiologists among 11 patients of COVID-19 pneumonia

175

were used as the positive sample, and 9369 CT scan images from 31 patients of non-COVID-19

176

pneumonia were used as the negative sample.

177

Evaluating the efficiency of radiologist in traditional way

178

To evaluate the performance and cost of time of radiologist against 2019-CoV pneumonia,

179

prospectively consecutive patients undergoing CT scans were enrolled in the designated CT rooms

180

in Feb 5, 2020 in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. An expert radiologist was required to

181

read all CT images of enrolled patients using the working computer, and determine if each patient

182

has viral pneumonia. The research assistant used a stopwatch to record the expert’s reading time.

183

The expert radiologist was associate chief physician of the Radiology Department of Renmin

184

Hospital of Wuhan University, with clinical experience of 30 years, and independently diagnosed

185

about 300 viral pneumonia. Hospitalized viral pneumonia cases judged by radiologists were all

186

diagnosed using COVID-19 nucleic acid detection kit to confirm COVID-19 infection. The

187

computed radiography imaging system used by the radiologist was VisionPACS (Intechhosun,

188

Being, China).

189
190

Comparison between the model and radiologist in prospective data

191

The CT scan images of the prospective patients as above were collected and imported into the

192

model for prediction. The model’s performance and cost of time were compared with that of the

193

expert radiologist. Inconsistent results between the expert and model were reviewed by three

194

radiologists, including the expert and other two radiologists, senior staff members of the

195

Radiology Department of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, with clinical experience about

196

10 years, and independently diagnosed about 150 viral pneumonia.

199

To evaluate the performance and cost of time of radiologist against 2019-CoV pneumonia with the

200

assistance of our model, the prediction results of the model (whether a patient has viral pneumonia,

201

and labels marking lesions) were copied to the working computer in the designated CT rooms.

202

After 10 days of wash out period (in Feb 16, 2020), the same expert radiologist was required to

203

re-read all CT images of 27 prospective patients using the working computer where results of the

204

model could be viewed, and determine if each patient has viral pneumonia. The research assistant

205

used a stopwatch to record the expert’s reading time again. Hospitalized viral pneumonia cases

206

judged by radiologists were all diagnosed using COVID-19 nucleic acid detection kit to confirm

207

COVID-19 infection. The computed radiography imaging system used by the radiologist was

208

VisionPACS (Intechhosun, Being, China).

209
210

Statistical analysis

211

A two-tailed paired Student's t test with a significance level of 0.05 was used to compare

212

differences in the cost time of the model and radiologist.

213
214

Role of the funding sources

215

The funder of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data

216

interpretation, or writing of the report. The corresponding author had full access to all the data in

217

the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.

diagnosed as viral pneumonia by the expert radiologist, and the other eleven patients were not.

245

Two other radiologists reviewed the CT imaging, approved the expert’s results, and summarized

246

that the CT characteristics of the 11 patients not diagnosed by the expert include 5 ground glass

247

nodules, 3 diminutive nodules, 2 normal and 1 fibrosclerosis.

248

The model successfully detected all the 16 patients of viral pneumonia diagnosed by the

249

expert. Among the other 11 patients, 2 were also detected by the model. The predictions in one

250

case was fibrosclerosis lesion, and the other one was normal stomach bubble. Using results of the

251

radiologists as the gold standard, the model achieved a per-patient sensitivity of 100%, accuracy

252

of 92.59%, specificity of 81.82%, PPV of 88.89% and NPV of 100% in the 27 prospective patients.

253

Among the 16 patients diagnosed as viral pneumonia by radiologists, 8 admitted patients were

254

confirmed as COVID-19 infection, and the others were outpatients that difficult to follow nucleic

255

acid results. The average prediction time for model was 41.34s per patient (IQR 39.76-44.48). The

256

performance of the model on detecting COVID-19 pneumonia was shown in Table 3.

264

average reading time for him to determine whether each patient has viral pneumonia was 116.12s

265

per case (IQR 85.69-118.17). After 10 days of wash out period, the same expert radiologist re-read

266

the CT images of the 27 prospective patients with the assistance of the AI model. The results for

267

determining whether each patient has viral pneumonia were not changed, while the average

268

reading time of the expert was greatly decreased by 65%. This indicates that the efficiency of

269

radiologist could be greatly improved with the assistance of AI.

270

A website has been made available to provide free access to the present model

271

(http://121.40.75.149/znyx-ncov/index) (Figure 5). CT scan images could be uploaded by both

272

clinicians and researches as a second opinion consulting service, especially in other provinces or

273

countries unfamiliar with the radiologic characteristics of COVID-19. Cases of COVID-19

274

pneumonia were also been made available on the open-access website, which might be a useful

275

resource for radiologists and researchers for fighting COVID-19 pneumonia.

DISCUSSION

278

As of Feb 14, 2020, the national health commission had reported 66,492 confirmed cases,

279

1,523 deaths and 8,969 suspected cases.[21] In the face of such large number of patients and high

280

contagiosity of the novel coronavirus (with an estimated reproduction number R0 of 2.2~6.47),

281

timely diagnosis and isolation are the keys to prevent further spread of the virus.[22-26] CT scan

282

is the most efficient modality for screening and clinically diagnosing COVID-19 pneumonia.[5,7]

283

However, compared to the needs of the patients, the number of radiologists is quite small,

284

especially in Hubei province, China, which could greatly delay the diagnosis and isolation of

285

patients, affect patient’s treatment and prognosis, and ultimately, affect the overall control of

286

COVID-19 epidemic.

287

Deep learning, a technology has shown great performance on extracting tiny features in

288

radiology data, may hold the promise to alleviate this problem.[11] Recently, Ardila D, et al

289

achieved end-to-end lung cancer screening on low-dose chest CT with an AUC of 94.4%.[27]

290

Chae KJ, et al successfully used the convolutional neural network to classify small (≤2 cm)

291

pulmonary nodules on CT scan images.[28] However, there was rare research being conducted to

292

detect viral pneumonia.[11,27,28] In previous work, our group succeeded in recruiting deep

293

learning in minor lesion detection and real-time assistance to doctors in gastrointestinal

294

endoscopy.[12-16] Here, we enrolled this technique in identification of COVID-19 pneumonia in

295

CT images. Results from both retrospective and prospective patients showed that the model was

296

comparable to the level of expert radiologist, and hold great potential to reduce diagnosing time.

297

(Figure 6)

298

Early diagnosis and early isolation of suspected patients are the most important ways to

299

prevent the spread of epidemic.19 Due to the sudden outbreak of COVID19, the radiology

300

department is overloaded and patients have to wait for long times for chest CT scan, which largely

301

increase the risk of cross-infection. In recent days, radiologists’ daily workload is huge in Hubei

302

province, and a CT scan report has to be awaited several hours to achieve. Based on the number of

303

suspected patients and close contacts in being, radiologists in the hardest hit, Hubei province,

304

China, may not be enough to resist the rapid spread of the virus, which holds high estimated R0 of

305

2.2~6.47.[23-26] It could be inferred that before radiologists fulfilling the demands of existing

306

patients, newly infected cases would appear, and the overall burden of radiologists is more

307

overwhelming like a growing snowball. Relieving the pressure of radiologists is essential for the

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.25.20021568; this version posted March 1, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

308

control of virus spreading. In the present study, our model achieved a comparable performance but

309

with much shorter time compared with expert radiologists. It holds great potential to relieve the

310

pressure of radiologists in clinical practice, and contribute to the control of the epidemic.

311

Timely diagnosis and early treatment of infected patients is important for patients’

312

prognosis.[29] The fatality rate of COVID19 patients in Hubei province is significantly higher

313

than that of other regions, which probably due to delayed treatment and shortage of medical

314

resources.[8,30] Accelerating diagnosis efficiency is significant for improving patient outcomes.

315

In the present study, our model helped expert radiologists achieve the same work with much

316

shorter time, which greatly accelerats the efficiency of diagnosis in clinical practice, and may

317

contribute to the improvement of patient outcome.

318

In addition to relieving radiologists’ pressure and accelerating diagnosis efficiency, artificial

319

intelligence also holds the potential to reduce miss diagnosis of COVID-19 patients. The lung

320

infection foci are sometimes mild in the early stage of the COVID-19 infection,5 and requires

321

careful observation under 0.625mm layer scanning. Radiologists vary in skills, and could be

322

affected by subjective status and outside pressure. One miss diagnosis could lead to multiple

323

spread. The model is highly sensitive and stable, and would never be affected by work burden and

324

work time. As a preliminary screening tool, it might help radiologists improve the sensitivity and

325

reduce miss diagnosis.

326

On the basis of the accuracy and efficiency of the model in detecting COVID-19 pneumonia,

327

a cloud-based open-access artificial intelligence platform was constructed to provide assistance for

328

detecting COVID-19 pneumonia worldwide. CT scan images could be uploaded freely by both

329

clinicians and researches as an assistant tool, especially in other provinces or countries unfamiliar

330

with the radiologic characteristics of COVID-19. This free open-access website can read images in

331

batches, provide high-level auxiliary diagnostic services for different hospitals in free, and expand

332

the boundaries of regions and manpower. Cases of COVID-19 pneumonia were also been made

333

available on the open-access website, which might be a useful resource for radiologists and

334

researchers for fighting COVID-19 pneumonia.

335

In summary, the deep learning-based model achieved a comparable performance with expert

336

radiologist using much shorter time. It holds great potential to improve the efficiency of diagnosis,

337

relieve the pressure of frontline radiologists, accelerates the diagnosis, isolation and treatment of

338

COVID19 patients, and therefore contribute to the control of the epidemic.
