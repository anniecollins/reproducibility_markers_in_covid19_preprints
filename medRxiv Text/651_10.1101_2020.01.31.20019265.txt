As the number of novel coronavirus cases grows both inside and outside of China, public health
authorities require evidence on the effectiveness of control measures such as thermal screening
of arrivals at airports. We evaluated the effectiveness of exit and entry screening for 2019-nCoV
infection. In our baseline scenario, we estimated that 46.5% (95%CI: 35.9 to 57.7) of infected
travellers would not be detected, depending on the incubation period, sensitivity of exit and
entry screening, and the proportion of cases which are asymptomatic. Airport screening is
unlikely to detect a sufficient proportion of 2019-nCoV infected travellers to avoid entry of
infected travellers. We developed an online tool so that results can be updated as new
information becomes available.

Background
As of 29 Jan 2019, 5,997 confirmed and 9,239 suspected cases of 2019-nCoV have been
reported from China with 132 deaths confirmed so far 1​​ . There were cases in at least 15 other
countries, identified due to symptoms plus recent travel history to Hubei province, China, which
strongly suggests that the reported cases constitute only a small fraction of the actual number of
infected individuals in China 2​​ . While the most affected region, Hubei province, has now ceased
air travel and closed major public transport routes 3​ it is unlikely that these measures will fully
contain the outbreak.
Despite limited evidence for its effectiveness 4,5​
​ , airport screening is frequently implemented to
limit the probability of infected cases entering other regions or countries. Here we use the
available evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of exit and entry screening for detecting
travellers with 2019-nCoV. We also provide an online app so that results can be updated as
new information becomes available.

Simulation of travellers at each stage of infection
We simulated 100 infected air travellers who are still infected with 2019-nCoV on arrival at their
destination and hence would pose a risk for seeding transmission in a new region. The duration
of travel is the flight time plus a small amount of additional travel time for airport procedures. We
assumed that most individuals will develop symptoms, including fever, at the end of their
incubation period and progress to more severe symptoms after a few days, resulting in
hospitalisation and isolation. Individuals may also exhibit an asymptomatic (subclinical) infection
where they do not exhibit symptoms that would be detected by thermal scanning or cause them
to seek medical care, although these individuals may be infectious. Travellers may exhibit
severe symptoms during their travel; upon arrival they are hospitalised without undergoing entry
screening. We then estimated the proportion of travellers who would be detected by exit and
entry screening, develop severe symptoms during travel, or go undetected, under varying
assumptions of:
- the proportion of asymptomatic infections;
- the sensitivity of exit and entry screening;
- the duration of travel;
- the incubation period;
- the time from the start of symptoms until hospitalisation (Table 1).
We assume that the time of starting travel is randomly and uniformly distributed between the
time of infection and twice the expected time to severe disease; however, we only consider
those travellers who depart before their symptoms worsen to the point that they would seek
hospital care 6​​ . We simulate travellers with individual incubation period, time from onset to
severe disease, flight start times and detection success at exit and entry screening according to
the screening sensitivities (Figure 3). We consider only the travel of infected individuals (not the
proportion of travellers who are infected) and therefore assume a screening specificity of 100%.
An individual will be detected at exit screening if their infection is not asymptomatic, their
departure time exceeds their incubation period, and their stochastic exit screening success
indicates detection. An individual will be detected at entry screening if their infection is not
asymptomatic, their incubation period ends after their departure but before their arrival, they
have not been detected at exit screening, and their entry screening success indicates detection.
Entry screening detections are further divided into detection due to severe symptoms and
detection of mild symptoms via equipment such as thermal scanners. We used 10,000
bootstrap samples to calculate 95% confidence intervals.
The model code is available via GitHub 7​ and the results can be further explored in an R Shiny
app at ​https://cmmid-lshtm.shinyapps.io/traveller_screening/​ (Figure 1).

period and time to severe disease e.g hospitalisation. Results are from stochastic simulation, and so there

twice. Sliders are provided to modify the duration of travel, the sensitivity of both exit and entry screening,
the proportion symptomatic, and the natural history parameters for the infection.

Effect of screening on detection
For the baseline scenario we estimated that 44 (95%CI: 33-56) of 100 infected travellers would
be detected by exit screening, 0 (95% CI: 0-3) case would develop severe symptoms during
travel, 9 (95%CI: 2-16) additional cases would be detected by entry screening, and the
remaining 46 (95%CI: 36-58) would not be detected.
The effectiveness of entry screening is largely dependent on the effectiveness of exit screening
in place. Under baseline assumptions, entry screening could detect 53 (95%CI: 35-72) instead
of 9 infected travellers if no exit screening was in place. However, the probability of developing
symptoms mid-flight increases with flight time and hence exit screening is more effective for
longer flights (Figure 2).
Syndromic screening designed to prevent infected and potentially infectious cases entering
undetected is highly vulnerable to asymptomatic infections and long incubation periods. If the
baseline scenario is modified to have 0% asymptomatic infections and 100% sensitivity of entry
screening, the incubation period will need to be approximately 10-fold shorter than the period
from symptom onset to severe disease (e.g. hospitalisation) in order to detect more than 90% of
infected travellers that would not otherwise report illness at either exit or entry screening.

travellers then progress to symptomatic and severe symptoms. Travellers may fly at any point within the
latent or symptomatic phases; any would-be travellers who show severe symptoms are hospitalised prior
to exit. Vertical lines represent the exit screening at start of travel (solid) and entry screening at end of

Conclusions
A​s a response to the ongoing outbreak of a novel coronavirus originating in Wuhan, the Chinese
government has implemented exit screening for international flights leaving China’s major
airports. Thermal scanning, which can identify passengers with fever (high external body
temperature), allows for passengers exhibiting symptoms of 2019-nCoV infection to be tested
before they board a flight. Similarly, entry screening for flights originating in the most affected
regions may be considered at airports in regions in and outside China. We estimate that the key
goal of syndromic screening at airports - to prevent infected travellers from entering regions with
little or no ongoing transmission - is only achievable if the rate of asymptomatic infections that
are transmissible is negligible, screening sensitivity is almost perfect, and the incubation period
is short. Based on data from Li et al. (2020)​8​, 2019-nCoV has a shorter incubation period than
SARS, and a higher rate of asymptomatic infections​9​. Under generally conservative
assumptions on sensitivity, we find that 46.5% of infected travellers will enter undetected.
Entry screening is an intuitive barrier for the prevention of infections entering a region or
country. However, evidence on its effectiveness is limited and given the lack of specificity, it
generates a high overhead of screened travellers uninfected with the targeted pathogen​4​. For
example, when entry screening was implemented in Australia in response to the 2003 SARS

outbreak, 1.84 million people were screened, 794 were detained, and no cases were
confirmed​10​. While some cases of 2019-nCoV have been identified through airport screening in
the current outbreak we estimate that likely many more infected travellers have passed through
screening undetected.
It is important to note that our estimates are based on a number of key assumptions that cannot
yet be informed directly by evidence from the ongoing 2019-nCoV outbreak. The current
outbreak has spread rapidly and early evidence suggests that the average severity is lower than
SARS. This may also suggest a substantial proportion of asymptomatic cases. A recent analysis
of a family transmission cluster is based on a small sample size but 1 in 6 infections was
asymptomatic 9​​ ; a major impediment for the effectiveness of syndromic screening. However, if
asymptomatic cases were not infectious they would not pose a risk for seeding infection chains
on arrival. To allow easy adaptation of our results as new insight becomes available in the
coming weeks we developed an online app.
Furthermore, the most up-to-date data on the incubation period or the time until recovery of
2019-nCoV has been used in this analysis, yet these figures are likely to change over time as
more data becomes available. Unless the incubation period is only a small fraction of the
duration of clinical symptoms, and fever in particular, syndromic screening is likely to detect an
insufficient fraction of infected cases to prevent local infections. In addition, the sensitivity of
airport screening for the detection of 2019-nCoV has not been evaluated. However, we chose
conservative estimates and show that with reduced sensitivity the effectiveness of syndromic
screening would further decline.
In many international airports, information is provided to travellers from affected regions
advising recommended action if they develop symptoms on or after arrival​11–14​. While this is
likely to be an effective strategy, we find that airport screening for initial symptoms, via thermal
scanners or similar, on either exit or entry is unlikely to detect a sufficient proportion of
2019-nCoV infected travellers in order to avoid entry of infected travellers and therefore the
potential for seeding of local transmission.
