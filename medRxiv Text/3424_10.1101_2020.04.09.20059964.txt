Key Points

46

Question: What are the demographic and clinical characteristics associated with testing

47

positive for coronavirus 2019 (Covid-19+), and among Covid-19+ subsequent hospitalization

48

and intensive care among Veterans in the United States?

49

Findings: In this retrospective cohort study of 2,026,227 Veterans aged 54-75 years and active

50

in care, 585/3,789 (15.4%) tested Covid-19+. Black race was strongly associated with Covid-19+,

51

but not with hospitalization or intensive care. Among Covid-19+, laboratory abnormalities and a

52

summary measure of physiologic injury were strongly associated with hospitalization and

53

intensive care.

54

Meaning: Racial differences in testing positive for Covid-19 may be an underestimate of the

55

general population as racial health disparities in the Veterans Affairs Healthcare System tend to

56

be smaller than in the private sector. Risk of hospitalization and intensive care may be better

57

characterized by laboratory measures and vital signs than by comorbid conditions or prior

58

medication exposure.

Abstract

60

Importance: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection causes

61

coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), an evolving pandemic. Limited data are available

62

characterizing SARS-Cov-2 infection in the United States.

63

Objective: To determine associations between demographic and clinical factors and testing

64

positive for coronavirus 2019 (Covid-19+), and among Covid-19+ subsequent hospitalization

65

and intensive care.

66

Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective cohort study including all patients tested for

67

Covid-19 between February 8 and March 30, 2020, inclusive. We extracted electronic health

68

record data from the national Veterans Affairs Healthcare System, the largest integrated

69

healthcare system in the United States, on 2,026,227 patients born between 1945 and 1965

70

and active in care.

71

Exposures: Demographic data, comorbidities, medication history, substance use, vital signs, and

72

laboratory measures. Laboratory tests were analyzed first individually and then grouped into a

73

validated summary measure of physiologic injury (VACS Index).

74

Main Outcomes and Measures: We evaluated which factors were associated with Covid-19+

75

among all who tested. Among Covid-19+ we identified factors associated with hospitalization or

76

intensive care. We identified independent associations using multivariable and conditional

77

multivariable logistic regression with multiple imputation of missing values.

78

Results: Among Veterans aged 54-75 years, 585/3,789 (15.4%) tested Covid-19+. In adjusted

79

analysis (

80

5.78) and the association remained in analyses conditional on site (OR 2.56, 95% CI 1.89-3.46).

81

In adjusted models, laboratory abnormalities (especially fibrosis-4 score [FIB-4] >3.25 OR 8.73,

82

95% CI 4.11-18.56), and VACS Index (per 5-point increase OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.43-1.84) were

83

strongly associated with hospitalization. Associations were similar for intensive care. Although

84

significant in unadjusted analyses, associations with comorbid conditions and medications were

85

substantially reduced and, in most cases, no longer significant after adjustment.

86

Conclusions and Relevance: Black race was strongly associated with Covid-19+, but not with

87

hospitalization or intensive care. Among Covid-19+, risk of hospitalization and intensive care

88

may be better characterized by laboratory measures and vital signs than by comorbid

89

conditions or prior medication exposure.

Introduction

91

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection causes coronavirus

92

disease 2019 (Covid-19) and is an evolving pandemic. Limited data are available characterizing

93

SARS-Cov-2 infection in the United States. Unadjusted analyses restricted to Covid-19 cases in

94

China,

95

lung disease (COPD), hypertension, vascular disease, renal disease, and liver disease are

96

associated with more severe disease. Further, while some have speculated that use of

97

angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE), angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), and

98

nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) may exacerbate disease,

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is the largest integrated healthcare system in the

102

United States. All care is recorded in a national electronic health record with daily uploads into

103

a central data repository. As a result, it is possible to extract data on patients tested for Covid-

104

19, including outpatient and inpatient records, laboratory values, and pharmacy fill/refill data.

105

When a well-characterized longitudinal cohort is supplemented with Covid-19 testing data, it is

106

possible to answer important questions rapidly using validated methods.

Data Source

116

Using data from the VA national Corporate Data Warehouse on members of the VA Birth

117

Cohort, we identified patients tested for Covid-19 from date of first recorded VA test on

118

February 8, 2020 through March 30, 2020. Available data included demographics, outpatient

119

and inpatient encounters, diagnoses, laboratory results, vital signs, health factors (e.g., smoking

120

and alcohol health behaviors), and pharmacy dispensing records.

Main Study Outcomes

135

We examined three outcomes: 1) testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19+), 2)

136

hospitalization, and 3) admission to an intensive care unit (ICU). We used VA inpatient bed

137

section codes 12 (medical) and 13 (cardiac) to identify ICU admission.

138

139

Covid-19 tests

140

We identified Covid-19 tests conducted in the VA using text searching of laboratory results

141

containing terms consistent with SARS-CoV-2 or Covid-19. If a patient had more than one test

142

and all were negative we selected first negative, otherwise we used date of first positive.

143

Patients for whom results were pending (n=93) or inconclusive (n=33) were excluded. Nearly all

144

tests utilized nasopharyngeal swabs, 1% were from other sources. Testing was performed in VA,

145

state public health and commercial reference laboratories using emergency use authorization

146

approved SARS-CoV-2 assays.

147

148

Comorbidity

149

We extracted diagnostic codes for asthma, cancer, COPD, chronic kidney disease, diabetes

150

mellitus, hypertension, liver disease, vascular disease, and alcohol use disorder (definitions

155

We collected pharmacy fills for ACE/ARBs, chemotherapy and immunosuppressive drugs, and

156

prescription NSAIDs and determined which medications were active in the year prior to testing.

157

Exposure windows for NSAIDS ended 14 days prior to baseline to minimize the potential of

158

protopathic bias. Exposure windows for other medications not used to treat Covid-19

159

symptoms ended three days prior to baseline.

160

161

Vital Signs, Clinical Laboratory Data, and a Summary Measure of Physiologic Injury

162

Vital signs measured within two days of baseline included body mass index (BMI), oxygen

163

saturation, pulse, systolic blood pressure, and temperature. We chose laboratory findings

164

closest to baseline within a year prior or up to one week after baseline. Measures included

165

alanine aminotransferase, albumin, aspartate aminotransferase, creatinine, estimated

166

glomerular filtration rate,

167

blood cell count, and lymphocyte count. We calculated a validated composite measure of

168

Statistical Analysis

172

We evaluated characteristics of patients undergoing Covid-19 testing, and among Covid-19+,

173

factors associated with hospital admission and intensive care, using chi-square, Fisher’s exact,

174

and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, as appropriate. For bivariate comparisons, statistical significance

175

reflects complete case analysis. When modeling Covid-19+, we restricted analyses to factors

177

medication history, health behaviors, and vital signs). Because age, black race, ACE/ARB use,

178

and NSAID use are of special interest, we included them in all multivariable models. Otherwise,

179

variables significant at p<0.05 in unadjusted analyses were included in the multivariable

180

models. When modeling hospital admission and intensive care, we compared

181

models including individual laboratory values to a model including VACS Index. In

182

analyses we explored the association between black race and Covid-19+ with a multivariable

model conditioned on site, among sites having at least five positive tests.

Veterans were more likely to be tested than white Veterans (28.0 versus 15.6). Women were

204

more likely to be tested than men (23.3 versus 18.3). Testing generally decreased with age (age

205

54-59: 21.5; age 60-64: 22.2; age 65-69: 18.6; and age 70-75: 15.4). Veterans living in urban

Discussion

268

Our analysis represents over 2 million veterans, aged 54-75 years, receiving care in the largest

269

integrated healthcare system in the United States. The study was conducted within an

270

established cohort and based on well annotated national electronic health record data,

271

enabling a rapid and reliable analysis of Covid-19 testing and initial outcomes. As a result, we

272

were able to validate and extend previous findings, to include a careful consideration of who is

273

Covid-19+ and, given a positive test, what factors were independently associated with

274

hospitalization and intensive care. We found that black Veterans were twice as likely to be

275

tested and 2.5 times as likely to test positive than non-black Veterans, even after adjusting for

276

urban residence and conditioning on geographic location. While we saw modest evidence of an

277

association between exposure to NSAIDs and risk of Covid-19+, vital signs and laboratory

278

measures better characterized risk of hospitalization and intensive care than did comorbid

279

diagnoses or prior medication exposures.

280

281

In unadjusted analyses, black Veterans were over four times as likely to test positive compared

282

to non-black Veterans; adjusting for urban versus rural residence did not change this

283

association. While black Veterans were much more likely to be tested at high prevalence

284

facilities, conditioning our analysis by site did not eliminate the association; black race retained

285

over a two-fold increased risk for testing Covid-19+. Of note, black Veterans were also more

286

likely to be tested, which could dilute the proportion positive. Further, black Veterans did not

287

experience higher rates of hospitalization or intensive care. Based on prior experience with

288

1918 Spanish Flu and 2009 H1N1 epidemic, public health experts have warned that minority

289

populations may be at higher risk of infection due to reduced capacity to implement physical

290

distancing.

291

disparities in VA tend to be smaller than in the private sector.

Our findings may be an underestimate of the US population as racial health

293

Women were more likely to be tested for Covid-19 than men, and men were twice as likely to

294

test positive. This association strengthened after adjustment and in conditional analyses (

295

2) but should be considered preliminary given limited numbers of women in this analysis.

As reported previously

elevated temperature was independently associated with testing

298

positive, hospital admission and intensive care, underscoring the value of including fever in the

299

current testing algorithms. Findings from the multivariable regression suggest that other factors

300

might also be used to indicate a test, including black race, male sex, and lack of an alternative

301

explanation for cough symptoms. To wit, we found that current smoking, COPD, and alcohol

302

use disorder, factors that generally increase risk of pneumonia, were associated with decreased

303

probability of testing positive. While they were not associated with hospitalization or intensive

304

care, it is too early to tell if these factors are associated with subsequent outcomes such as

305

respiratory failure or mortality.

307

Presence of particular comorbid diagnoses may be less prognostic than overall acute on chronic

308

injury reflected in laboratory abnormalities largely encompassed in the VACS Index. In

309

unadjusted analyses, several comorbid conditions were associated with hospitalization and

310

intensive care but were not independently associated after adjusting for vital signs and

311

laboratory data. Further, while elevated white blood cell counts and decreased lymphocyte

312

counts were associated with hospitalization and intensive care, the pronounced independent

313

association with FIB-4 (a composite of platelets and transaminases) and albumin suggest that

314

virally induced hepatic inflammation may be a harbinger of the cytokine storm.

319

admitted, and the 12.6-point difference between those who received and did not receive

blood pressure. However, confidence intervals were wide, include clinically important

330

differences, and conclusions may change as the epidemic evolves. We will continue to update

331

these analyses as more data become available.

332

333

While this analysis adds information to the evolving pandemic, its limitations must be kept in

334

mind. First, a small proportion of Veterans have been tested and rates of testing vary widely by

335

site. Second, women represented a small number of Veterans in the sample (184 tested, 13

336

positive). Third, our analysis of outcomes is preliminary as many Covid-19+ patients are still in

337

care. Fourth, while a strength of this analysis is our ability to determine active VA medications,

338

we could only detect NSAID exposure based upon VA pharmacy fill/refill data, individuals are

339

also likely to purchase NSAIDS over the counter. As real-world data become available, more

340

sophisticated and focused pharmacoepidemiological analyses will be required to address

341

concerns regarding potential risk of medications associated with Covid-19.

342

343

Conclusion

344

Black race was strongly associated with Covid-19+, but not with hospitalization or intensive

345

care. Unadjusted associations between medication exposure, comorbid disease, and

346

hospitalization and intensive care are diminished after adjustment. Risk of hospitalization and

347

intensive care associated with Covid-19 may be better characterized by vital signs and

348

measures of physiologic injury than by comorbid conditions or medication history.
