Abstract

SARS-CoV-2 genome accumulates point mutations constantly. However, whether
non-synonymous mutations affect COVID-19 severity through altering viral protein
function remains unknown. SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing revealed that the number
of non-synonymous mutations correlated inversely with COVID-19 severity in Tokyo
Metropolitan area. Phylogenic tree analyses identified two predominant groups which
were differentiated by a set of six-point mutations (four non-synonymous amino acid
mutations). Among them, Pro108Ser in 3 chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) and
Pro151Leu in nucleocapsid protein occurred at conserved locations among

β-coronaviruses. Patients with these mutations (N = 48) indicated significantly lower odds
ratio for developing hypoxia which required supplemental oxygen (odds ratio 0.24 [95%
CI 0.07-0.88, p-value = 0.032]) after adjustments for age and sex, versus those lacking this
haplotype in the canonical Clade 20B (N = 37). The Pro108Ser 3CLpro enzyme in vitro
decreases in the activity by 58%, and the hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass
spectrometry reveals that mechanisms for reduced activities involve structural perturbation

at the substrate-binding region which is positioned behind and distant from the 108th
amino acid residue of the enzyme. This mutant strain rapidly outcompeted pre-existing
variants to become predominant in Japan. Our results may benefit the efforts underway to
design small molecular compounds or antibodies targeting 3CLpro.

Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of the
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. As an RNA virus with limited fidelity for
genome replication, the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome constantly accumulates point mutations at
an average of two nucleotides per months (GISAIDs: http://www.gisaid.org/), while large
rearrangements such as a 382-base deletion in the region encoding ORF8 can occur (1,2).
Although the 382-base deletion was associated with a milder clinical course, whether the
accumulation of point mutations is associated with a better prognosis is unclear.
Our institute, Keio University Hospital, has a catchment area of the Tokyo Metropolitan
area and the surrounding prefectures, and we have been performing whole viral genome
sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients since March 2020, aiming to characterize
healthcare-associated infections rapidly and effectively and to prevent the spread of infection
(3). Molecular viral genome sequencing studies have indicated that the number of mutations is
indeed increasing (4,5). According to a Japanese governmental report, the daily number of
newly identified COVID-19 patients in Tokyo plateaued during the time period when
restrictions were imposed on the entry of foreigners to Japan, while the number of seriously ill
patients has been decreasing since May 2020

(https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/covid-19/kokunainohasseijoukyou.html). Hence, the relative
proportion of seriously ill patients has been decreasing, and the mortality rates in Japan appear
to be lower than the rates reported in Western countries (https://covid19.who.int/) (6).
We hypothesized that the accumulation of mutations may have contributed to the
decrease in clinical virulence. Molecular surveillance of patients infected in the Tokyo
Metropolitan area led us to characterize the non-synonymous Pro108Ser mutation in the 3
chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) which has been focused on therapeutic targets for feline
coronavirus (7).

Results
Viral genome sequence analysis
A total of 70 viral haplotypes were observed in the 90 individuals. A mean of 11.8
mutations (SD = 3.1]) separated the lineage from the founding Wuhan haplotype (the
central haplotype of clade A). None of the strains had truncating mutations such as
frameshift or non-sense mutations. The number counts of non-synonymous mutations
among the strains varied from 2 to 12 (mean, 7.5 [SD], 2.4]), as compared with the
Wuhan reference strain.

Clinical background of COVID-19 patients
The clinical characteristics of the 90 patients are shown in Supplementary Table 1.
Nineteen patients (23.3%) required supplemental oxygen, and eight (8.9%) developed
acute respiratory distress syndrome; five of these eight patients died.

Number counts of non-synonymous mutations of SARS-CoV-2 and severity of COVID-19
The number counts of non-synonymous mutations were significantly higher among
the COVID-19 patients who did not require supplemental oxygen (Figure 1A: mean, 7.9
[SD 2.2] vs. 5.9 [SD 2.2], p-value < 0.001) and increased as the severity decreased (Figure
1B: JT = 404, p-value < 0.001). The number counts of non-synonymous mutations with
deleterious PROVEAN scores were also higher among the patients who did not require
supplemental oxygen (mean, 1.5 [SD, 1.1] vs. 0.9 [SD 0.9], p-value = 0.016) and
increased as the severity decreased (JT = 556, p-value = 0.035).

We investigated whether any of the phylogenic clade containing non-synonymous
mutations contributed to a milder clinical course. The overall genetic diversity was
relatively low, presumably because effective international border restrictions and
successful quarantine efforts were in place. A divergent tree analysis of the whole viral
genome sequences and classification at Keio University Hospital (N = 90) and in Japan (N
= 9106) according to the internationally recommended nomenclature showed that most
(i.e., 85 [94.4%] in our study and 8426 [92.5%] in Japan) patients had strains derived from
Clade 20B, respectively (Figure 2A) (8). The remaining 5 patients in our cohort study
belonged to Clade 19A with the functionally relevant Asp614Gly mutant in the spike
protein (9), and were therefore excluded from further study. Patients from Clade 20B
(Keio, N = 85; Japan, N = 8426) were additionally divided into two subgroups by defining
a subgroup as patients who had strains with no more than 5 nucleotide differences. The
first subgroup was designated as the subclade 20B-T (Our study, N = 48 [56.5%]; Japan,
N = 4172 [49.5%]), which had the basic haplotype of Clade 20B but had additional 6
single nucleotide mutations: c.4346 U>C, c.9286 C>U, c.10376 C>U, c.14708 C>U,
c.28725 C>U and c.29692 C>U (Figure 2A, yellow). Of the six mutations, four were
non-synonymous: c.4346 U>C (Ser543Pro in papain-like protease [PLpro]), c.10376 C>U

(Pro108Ser in 3CLpro), c.14708 C>U (Ala423Val in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase
[RdRp]), and c.28725 C>U (Pro151Leu in nucleocapsid protein); the remaining two other
mutations did not affect the amino acid translation of the viral proteins. The second
subgroup was designated as Clade 20B-nonT (Our study, N = 37 [43.5%]; Japan, N =
4254 [50.5%]), which showed the haplotype of Clade 20B, and was defined by seven
mutations separating the lineage from the founding Wuhan haplotype, but had fewer than
five single nucleotide mutations. Analyses of the cumulative total number and frequency
curve showed that the relative fraction of Clade 20B-T increased during the time frame of
this study (Figures 2B-C). Mapping of the suspected geographic locations where infection
in individual patients took place indicated that the patients with Clade 20B-T or Clade
20B-nonT were infected in the Tokyo Metropolitan area and its neighboring prefectures
(Figure 2D). This observation, together with a lack of patients with strains belonging to
other clades (except for the 5 patients with Clade 19A who belonged to the same cluster)
suggested that Clade 20B and its variation Clade 20B-T were the predominant strains in
Japan during the observation period.

Milder clinical course in Clade 20B-T patients

A comparison of the clinical characteristics of the patients with Clade 20B-T (N = 48)
with those of the patients with Clade 20B-nonT (N = 37) is shown in Table 1. Age, sex,
symptoms at admission, and outcome did not differ significantly between the two main groups,
but requiring oxygen supplementation was significantly lower among the patients with Clade
20B-T than in those with Clade 20B-nonT (12.5% vs. 32.4%, p-value = 0.033). An exact
logistic regression analysis showed that patients with Clade 20B-T had a lower odds ratio for
developing hypoxia requiring supplemental oxygen, versus those with Clade 20B-nonT
(adjusted odds ratio, 0.24 [95% CI, 0.07-0.88], p-value = 0.032; Table 2) after adjustments for
age group (< 65 years or ≧65 years) and sex (female or male).

Molecular evolutionary characterization of four non-synonymous mutations unique to
Clade 20B-T
We used molecular evolutionary analyses to decipher which of the four
non-synonymous mutations that characterize the Clade 20B-T haplotype contributed to a
milder clinical course. Studies of the conservation of the amino acid residues around the
non-synonymous mutations in Clade 20B-T indicated that residues at and around
Pro108Ser in the 3CLpro (NSP5), and those at and around Pro151Leu in the nucleocapsid

protein were highly conserved in β-coronaviruses (Figure 3A, B). By contrast, amino acid
residues at and around Ser543Pro in the PLpro (NSP3) and Ala423Val in RNA-dependent
RNA polymerase (RdRp, NSP12) were only weakly conserved (Figure 3A). On the other
hand, the serine in the PLpro at residue 543 and the Ala at residue 423 in RdRp, are
substituted with proline and valine in some β-coronaviruses, where both mutations were
observed in Clade 20B-T, suggesting that Ser543Pro in the PLpro and Ala423Val in RdRp
are likely to be functionally neutral. The PROVEAN predicted that these 2 mutations were
not deleterious.
Thus, Pro108Ser in the 3CLpro and Pro151Leu in the nucleocapsid protein can be
considered plausible candidate amino acid mutations that are functionally relevant and
may explain a milder clinical course. Because 3CLpro is well characterized by biochemical
and pharmacological analysis (10,11) whereas nucleocapsid protein is not, we focused on
the function-structure relationship of the P108S mutant of 3CLpro for further investigation.

P108S 3CLpro reduces the catalytic activity and attenuates the sensitivity to GC376
We prepared recombinant proteins of WT and P108S of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro to
determine the activities by a fluorescence-based cleavage assay (Figure 4A) (11). The

enzymatic activity of the P108S was suppressed significantly as compared with that of the WT
(Figures 4B). The Km value of P108S (215.7 μM) was lower than that of WT (110.3 μM), and
the activity is also decreased by 58%, so far as judged by comparison of the Kcat/Km values of
the WT and P108S 3CLpro enzymes (Figure 4C). These results suggest that the P108S mutation
interferes with the ability of the enzyme to allow substrate binding.
We further examined the sensitivity of P108S mutant against a competitive 3CLpro
inhibitor GC376. Recently, a feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) inhibitor GC376 has
been reported to block the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro activity by binding to the substrate-binding
pocket (12,13). The enzymatic activity of WT was potently inhibited (Ki=1.93 μM) by GC376.
On the other hand, the inhibitory effect of GC376 on P108S mutant was decreased by Ki= 3.74

μM (Figure 4D).
Since previous studies of SARS-CoV 3CLpro indicates that dimerization of 3CLpro
activates its enzymatic activity (14,15), we analyzed the dimeric states of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro
WT and P108S with SV-AUC. Analysis of the WT and P108S similarly showed concentration
dependencies of the weight averaged s-value (Supplementary Figure 1), indicating that the
values of monomer-dimer dissociation constants are comparable between WT and P108S
mutant proteins in the given concentration ranges. The analysis with circular dichroism (CD)

spectroscopy showed no discernible differences in the secondary and tertiary structures
between the two proteins (Supplementary Figure 2). On the other hand, HDX-MS enabled to
detect the structural perturbations around the substrate-binding pocket including C128-L141
close to P108 and Y161-D176 (Figure 5A-D), suggesting that the P108S mutation perturbs the
pocket which is behind and distant from the mutation.

Discussion
The number count of non-synonymous mutations was inversely correlated with the
severity of COVID-19 disease in a cohort of 90 patients whose viral genome sequences
had been completely sequenced. Patients with a viral haplotype containing the 3CLpro
Pro108Ser tended to have a milder disease course than those with a viral haplotype
lacking the mutation. Furthermore, the Kcat/Km value of 3CLpro containing Ser108 was
decreased by 58% as compared with that of 3CLpro containing Pro108. Altogether, these
clinical and experimental observation suggest that Pro108Ser, which is becoming
prevalent in Tokyo, is associated with milder clinical course.
3CLpro is the main protease that cleaves viral polyproteins into functional proteins
(16). Based on the SV-AUC, CD spectroscopy, and HDX-MS results, it can be concluded that

although the mutation of Pro108 to Ser does not affect the overall structure or association state
of 3CLpro, the substrate binding site is locally impacted by the mutation, leading to the reduced
binding affinity to substrate rather than the monomer-dimer transition of the protease. Thus,
Pro108Ser may play an important role in viral replication and pathogenicity.
Since the time of the SARS-CoV epidemic in 2002 and 2003, various therapeutic
agents and vaccines have been developed, but not with particularly satisfactory results
(17). Apart from human coronavirus infections, GC376 has been shown to be effective
against FIPV, which belongs to the α-coronavirus family. GC376 exerts its antiviral action
through a reduction in viral replication by creating a covalent bond with the active sites in
3CLpro protein (18,19). The administration of GC376 is associated with a high rate of
disease remission and no significant side effects when used against FIPV (20). These
findings together with recent studies showing an inhibitory effect of GC376 on the 3CLpro
of SARS-CoV-2 through the repression of viral replication in vitro suggest that GC376
and its homologs represent promising therapeutic options (7,12,13). Although Pro108Ser
decreased the activity of GC376, both Pro108Ser and GC376 had the inhibitory effects on
3CLpro, giving an important clue to developing an anti-viral drug targeting 3CLpro (21).

In general, RNA viruses continue to survive and proliferate by constantly changing
their forms through mutations and adapting to various environments, but quasispecies
with high replicability have difficulty when it comes to long-term survival because of their
high sensitivity to environmental influences (i.e., survival of the fittest) (22). The latest
observation in the United Kingdom that the strain VOC 202012/01 emerged in southeast
England in November 2020 has rapidly spread towards fixation is compatible with this
theory (23). On the other hand, quasispecies with low replicability may have reduced
infectivity and pathogenicity but actually have long-term survival advantages because they
are less likely to be subjected to natural selection (i.e., survival of the flattest) (24).
Coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2, are known to have relatively high
but incomplete fidelity in replicating their genome (25). Of the proteins involved in the
replication of the viral genome, proteases, including 3CLpro, are critical for viral
replication. Therefore, Pro108Ser in 3CLpro may lead to a situation in which the virus is
less susceptible to natural selection and better suited to long-term survival, reducing viral
infectivity and virulence. In fact, Japan whole genome data (N = 9106) recently updated
on 10th December 2020 revealed that the Japanese-specific Clade 20B-T including
Pro108Ser in 3CLpro progressed to fixation within the Clade 20B during the time period

when restrictions were imposed on the entry of foreigners to Japan. We should observe
carefully whether Clade 20B-T with these unique mutations would represent a survival of
the flattest in Japan.
The present study was limitated in that we could not fully explore the contribution
of the other putatively deleterious mutation Pro151Leu in tetramer-forming nucleocapsid
protein, which enters the host cells along with the viral RNA and is responsible for
processing the assembly and release of viral particles (26). The computer-based protein
structure predicted that the Pro151Leu mutation in nucleocapsid proteins is less flexible,
but has no significant changes in protein structure or stabilities (Supplementary Figure 3).
In conclusion, viral genome sequencing in Tokyo showed that Pro108Ser in 3CLpro,
ameliorates the COVID-19 severity. The specific mutant strain containing Pro108Ser in
3CLpro constitutes a major Clade 20B-Tokyo. Our protein analysis demonstrated that the
3CLpro mutant reduces the function of the protein. The mutant strain rapidly outcompeted
pre-existing variants to become the dominant one in Japan. Our results may benefit the
efforts under way to design small molecular compounds or antibodies targeting 3CLpro.

Study design and patients
A total of 187 patients who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 between 17th
March and 31st August on the basis of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) results at Keio University Hospital were enrolled. Of these 187 patients, 134
(71.7 %) underwent whole viral genome sequencing. Of these, 44 patients with only
partial genome sequences resulting from insufficient PCR amplification were excluded,
leaving 90 patients for analysis (Supplementary Figure 4). Thirty-two of these 90 patients
had been reported previously (3). The medical records of all 90 patients were reviewed to
obtain data on clinical characteristics and treatments received, and PCR data obtained
from samples collected from the nasopharynx, sputum or saliva were collected. The study
protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Keio University School of Medicine
(approval number: 20200062) and was conducted according to the principles of the
Declaration of Helsinki.

Definitions and classification of disease severity of COVID-19 infection
Disease severity of patients was classified according to the clinical management
guidelines of the World Health Organization (27) and Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labour,

and Welfare (https://www.mhlw.go.jp/content/000650160.pdf). In some of patients with
mild or moderate symptoms, the presence of pneumonia could not be determined because
they did not have chest X-ray or computed tomography examinations. Therefore, we
classified disease severity into the following three categories: “mild to moderate,”
(patients did not require supplementary oxygen); “severe,” (patients required oxygen
supplementation but not a ventilator); and “critical,” (patients who developed sepsis or
acute respiratory distress syndrome and required a ventilator [Supplementary Table 2])
(27).

DNA sequencing method
The whole viral genome sequences, PCR-based amplification and phylogenic tree
analysis were determined as previously reported (Takenouchi et al.) (3). All point
mutations including non-synonymous and synonymous mutations were annotated with
ANNOVAR software and assessed with VarSifter
(https://research.nhgri.nih.gov/software/VarSifter/). The multiple amino acid sequence
alignments of various β-coronaviruses were compared with Molecular Evolutionary
Genetic Analysis software (MEGA, https://www.megasoftware.net/) (Supplementary

Table 3). The functional relevance of non-synonymous mutations was predicted with a
Protein Variation Effect Analyzer (PROVEAN v1.1.3,
http://provean.jcvi.org/seq_submit.php), the calculations of which are not dependent on
sequence conservation among animals. Scores under a threshold value of -2.50 were
considered deleterious.

Cloning and protein preparation of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro
The SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro DNA fragments encoding the Wuhan strain or the strain
containing Pro108Ser in non-structural polyprotein 5 (NSP5) gene were prepared using a
reverse transcription kit (SuperScript III, ThermoFishher) and were amplified by PCR
using primers (forward: 5’-TTTGGATCCAGTGGTTTTAGAAAAATGGCA-3’,
reverse: 5’-TTTGTCGACTCATTGGAAAGTAACACCTGAGCA-3’). The fragments
were digested with Bam HI and Sal I and then ligated into pCold GST containing the
cleavage site for PreScision Protease (GE Healthcare) at the N-terminal region. The
expression vectors for the 3CLpro Wuhan strain type (WT) or the Pro108Ser mutant
(P108S) were transformed into BL21 (DE3), and the bacteria were incubated in LB with
ampicillin at 37°C until OD600 was reached at 0.8. Protein expression was induced by 1

mM isopropyl-β-thiogalactopyranoside for 16 h at 4°C. The cell pellets were re-suspended
in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH7.5), 100 mM NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20,
sonicated twice for 5 min at 4°C, and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min. The
supernatant was incubated with glutathione Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare) for 2h at 4°C.
The resin was then washed five times with the same buffer, and the GST tag was cleared
by the addition of PreScision Protease and further incubation for 16 h at 4°C. Then, the
3CLpro was prepared using size-exclusion chromatography (Superdex 200; GE
Healthcare).

Enzyme kinetics analysis using fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based assay
The enzymatic activities of 3CLpro WT and P108S were determined using a
fluorescent substrate with the cleavage site of SARS CoV-2 3CLpro
(Dabcyl-KTSAVLQ↓SGFRKME-Edans; GL Biochem). 3CLpro WT or P108S at a final
concentration of 5 μM was incubated in a buffer of 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH7.5), 100 mM
NaCl, and 5 mM DTT with the addition of the substrate at a final concentration of 3.125,
6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, 100 or 200 μM at room temperature. The change in fluorescence
intensity was monitored with a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Cytation 5; BioTek) at an

emission wavelength of 460 nm and an excitation wavelength at 340 nm. The kinetic
parameters were determined with GraphPad Prism 8 software and the initial rate
measurement of the substrate cleavage. For the inhibition assay, the SARS-CoV 3CLpro
inhibitor GC376 (Selleck) at a final concentration of 1, 2, 5, 10, or 20 μM was incubated
with 5 μM 3CLpro WT or P108S and 12.5, 25 or 50 μM of substrate.

Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy
CD spectra were collected in the far-UV (200-260 nm) and the near-UV (250-340
nm) spectral regions. Spectra were recorded with a CD spectrometer J-1500 (JASCO
Corporation) in a quartz cuvette (1 mm cell length for far-UV and 10 mm for near-UV) at
20ºC. The protein samples were prepared in 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer solution (pH 7.3)
containing 150 mM NaCl with concentration of 5 µM for the far-UV CD measurements
and 20 µM for the near-UV CD measurements. The spectrum of the buffer was measured
as a blank and was subtracted from the sample data. Four scans were averaged for each
spectral region with a scan rate of 50 nm/min. The data pitch and the bandwidth were 0.5
nm and 1 nm, respectively.

Sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation (SV-AUC)
SV-AUC experiments were performed using the Optima AUC (Beckman Coulter)
at 20°C with 1, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 80 µM of 3CLpro WT and P108S dissolved in 20
mM Tris-HCl buffer solution (pH7.3) containing 150 mM NaCl. Next, 390 µL of each
sample was loaded into the sample sector of a 12-mm double-sector charcoal-filled Epon
centerpiece, and 400 µl of buffer was loaded into the reference sector of each cell. Data
collection was performed at 42,000 rpm using a UV detection system. Data were collected
every 240 s with a radial increment of 10 µm at 230 nm for 1, 2.5, and 5 µM samples, at
235 nm for 10 µM samples, at 240 nm for 20 µM samples, at 290 nm for 40 µM samples,
and at 295 nm for 80 µM samples. The collected data were analyzed using a continuous
c(s) distribution model implemented in program SEDFIT (version 16.2b) (28) with fitting
for the frictional ratio, meniscus, time-inmutation noise, and radial-inmutation noise. Both
of the partial specific volumes of WT 3CLpro and the P108S were 0.731 cm3/g, which was
calculated based on the amino acid composition of each sample using the program
SEDNTERP 1.09. The buffer density and viscosity were calculated using program
SEDNTERP 1.09 as 1.00499 g/cm3 and 1.0214 cP, respectively. Figures of the c (s20, w)
distribution were generated using the program GUSSI (version 1.3.2) (29). The

weight-average sedimentation coefficient of each sample was calculated by integrating the
range of sedimentation coefficients where peaks with an obvious concentration
dependence were observed. To determine the dissociation constant of the monomer-dimer
equilibrium (KD), the concentration dependence of the weight-average sedimentation
coefficient was fitted to the monomer-dimer self-association model implemented in the
program SEDPHAT (version 15.2b) (30,31).

Hydrogen Deuterium Exchange Mass Spectrometry (HDX-MS)
HDX-MS experiments were conducted using Waters HDX with LEAP system
(Waters). 80 μM protein solutions (SARS CoV-2 3CLpro WT and SARS CoV-2 3CLpro
P108S) were diluted 20-fold with 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer solution (pD 7.3) prepared with
D2O containing 150 mM NaCl, and incubated at 20°C for various hydrogen/deuterium
exchange time period (0.5, 1, 10, 60, or 240 min). The concentration of the protein
solution during deuterium exchange was 4 μM, and based on the KD estimated from
SV-AUC, each protein was considered to be present in more than 98% monomer. The
exchange reaction was quenched by dropping the pH to 2.4 with mixing equal volume of
4 M Guanidinium chloride, 0.5 M Tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP),

pH 2.2. One hundred pmol of quenched samples were immediately injected, desalted, and
separated online using a Waters UPLC system based on a nanoACQUITY platform. The
online digestion was performed over 5 min in water containing 0.05% formic acid at 4°C
at a flow rate of 100 μl/min. The digested peptides were trapped on an ACQUITY UPLC
BEH C18 1.7 μm peptide trap (Waters) maintained at 0°C and desalted with water and
0.1% formic acid. Flow was diverted by a switching valve, and the trapped peptide
fragments were eluted at 40 μl/min onto a column of 1 × 100 mm (C18 1.7 μm,
ACQUITY UPLC BEH, Waters) held at 0°C, with a 12 min linear acetonitrile gradient
(8–40%) containing 0.1% formic acid. The eluate was directed into a mass spectrometer
(Synapt HD, Waters) with electrospray ionization and lock mass correction (using
Glu-fibrinogen peptide B). Mass spectra were transformed using MassLynx (Waters) and
acquired over the m/z range of 100–2000. Pepsin fragments were identified using a
combination of exact mass and MS/MS, aided by ProteinLynx Global SERVER (PLGS,
Waters). Peptide deuterium levels were determined using DynamX 3.0 (Waters). The
relative deuterium uptake percentage was calculated for each peptide by dividing the
mean of deuterium uptake,

coordinate for the tetramer of nucleocapsid protein (protein data bank ID “6VYO”). We
then used the DynaMut server (http://biosig.unimelb.edu.au/dynamut/) to infer the effect
of non-synonymous mutations on the nucleocapsid protein 3D structures in terms of
molecular stabilities, and flexibilities (33). We also estimated the differences of free
energy change (ΔΔG) and vibrational entropy change (ΔΔSVib) accompanied by the
mutation using DynaMut (34), which implements ENCoM reports on the impact on
protein stability and flexibility accompanied by mutations in the wild‐type structure.
Structural changes, such as changes in cavity volume, packing density, and accessible
surface area, are correlated with ΔΔG, thereby ΔΔG can be used as an indicator of the
impact of a mutation on protein stability (35). A ΔΔG value of less than zero indicates that
the mutation causes destabilization, while a ΔΔG above zero indicates protein
stabilization.

Statistical analysis
The main parameter of the clinical study was the grade of disease severity.
Comparisons of categorical variables between two groups were assessed using the Fisher
exact test. A Student’s t-test was used to compare abnormally distributed quantitative

tendency among three groups. An exact logistic regression analysis was used to examine
the odds ratio for requiring supplemental oxygen. The following covariates were
considered for inclusion in the multivariate model: age group (< 65 years or ≧ 65 years),
sex, and infection group (Clade 20B-T or 20B-nonT). Statistical analyses were performed
using R statistical Software (version 3.6.2), and all statistical tests were two-sided.

Figure 1: Number of non-synonymous mutations of SARS-CoV-2 is inversely
correlated with COVID-19 disease severity.
(A) The number of non-synonymous mutations (vertical axis) was significantly lower in
COVID-19 patients who required supplemental oxygen than in those who did not
(Student’s t-test: mean, 7.9 [SD, 2.2] vs. 5.9 [SD, 2.2], *p-value < 0.001). (B) The number
of non-synonymous mutations (vertical axis) tended to decrease as the COVID-19
severity increased (Jonckheere-Terpstra trend analysis: JT = 404, * p-value < 0.001).

time-resolved phylogenic tree. Most of the Japanese strains were derived from National
Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) submitted on December 10 in GISAID, but were
not specified by towns/cities or precise obtaining dates (obtaining month only). Therefore,
we designated all the NIID data for the first day of the month (i.e., 2020/4 → 2020/4/1).
Lines from phylogenic tree of Keio University Hospital (left) to that of all Japanese strains
(right) indicate the phylogenetic relation and Nextstrain assignment of Japanese strains.
Right- and left-directed arrows in the horizontal axis indicate observation dates in Keio
University Hospital and Japan, respectively. Yellow branches represent the predominant
Clade “20B-T” both in Keio University Hospital and in Japan which had the six additional
mutations compared with the remaining strains Clade “20B-nonT” of Clade 20B. (B)
Temporal trends of the number of patients of Clade 20B-T and Clade 20B-nonT at our
institute. Clade 20B-T became predominant over Clade 20B-nonT. (C) The cumulative
frequency of Clade 20B-T increased steadily to exceed 50% at our institute. (D) The
suspected location of infection of individuals from Clade 20B-T and those from Clade
20B-nonT scattered over the Tokyo Metropolitan area and its neighboring prefectures.
