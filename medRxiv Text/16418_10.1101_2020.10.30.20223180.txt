Abstract
Healthcare professionals are at higher risk of contracting the novel coronavirus due to their work
exposure in the healthcare settings. Practicing appropriate preventive measures to control COVID19 infection is one of the most important interventions that healthcare workers are expected to use.
The aim of this study was to assess the level of risk perception and practices of preventive measures
of COVID-19 among health workers in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. A hospital-based cross-sectional
study was conducted from 9th to 26th June 2020 among healthcare professionals working at six
public hospitals in Addis Ababa. Data were collected using a self-administered structured
questionnaire. Frequency, percentage, and mean were used to summarize the data. A binary
logistic regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with risk perception
about COVID-19. A total of 1,134 participants were surveyed. Wearing facemask (93%), hand
washing for at least 20 seconds (93%), covering mouth and nose while coughing or sneezing
(91%), and avoiding touching eyes, nose, and mouth (91%) were the commonly self-reported
preventive practices. About 88% perceived that they were worried about the risk of becoming
infected with coronavirus, and majority (91%) worried about the risk of infection to their family.
The mean score of overall fear and worry of COVID-19 was 2.37 on a scale of 1 to 3. Respondents
who ever provided clinical care to COVID-19 patients were more likely to report fear and worry
(adjusted OR=1.34, 95% CI:1.02-1.91), however those who ever participated in Ebola or SARS
outbreaks were less likely to report fear and worry due to COVID-19 crisis (adjusted OR=0.66,
95% CI:0.48-0.90). This study has revealed widespread practices of preventive measures and the
highest perceived risk of COVID-19 among healthcare workers. Therefore, an effective risk
communication intervention should be implemented to ensure the maintenance of appropriate
practices during the current COVID-19 pandemic.

Introduction
The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that was declared as a pandemic by the World
Health Organization (WHO) on the 11th of March 2020 [1] has affected over 37 million people
and has caused more than one million deaths globally as of 12th October 2020 [2]. The new severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has now spread to 213 countries and
territories around the world. Up to 20th September 2020, Ethiopia reported a total of 68,820
confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases and 28,314 recoveries from over
1,202,818 total tests, among whom 1,096 have died [3]. Over 1,311 health workers have contracted
coronavirus in Ethiopia as of 17th September 2020.

Healthcare providers who are in the healthcare settings to care for the COVID-19 patients are
highly vulnerable to SARS-COV-2 infection [4]. Most healthcare workers are working in isolation
units, critical care units, intensive care units (ICUs), emergency units, working in frontline
positions, and having contact with suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases. During the early
stage of COVID-19 pandemic in the USA, the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among
healthcare workers was 7.3% and particularly, infections were most common among nurses [5]. In
the south of the Netherlands, 96 (5%) of 1796 health care workers screened in three hospitals were
tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 just 10 days after the first reported COVID-19 case in the country
[6]. More than 278 physicians from almost all medical specialties have died due to COVID-19 as
of 15 April 2020 with the majority (44%) from Italy mainly because of lack understanding of the
virus and its preventive measures [7]. Studies in China reported 3,387 COVID-19 cases among
HCWs (4.4% of all cases), with 23 attributable deaths [8]. In some countries at the peak of their
infection, such as Spain, they have reported that 13% to 14% of the country’s cases were in

healthcare workers [9]. Overall, as much as 10% of healthcare workers are infected with SARSCoV-2 in some countries [4] and the WHO has developed infection prevention and control
guidance to be implemented at the national and healthcare facility level in order to reduce
coronavirus infection among healthcare workers [10].

Studies have identified major sources of worry and anxiety among healthcare professionals due to
lack of appropriate PPE; being exposed to COVID-19 at work and taking the infection home to
their family; not having rapid access to testing if they develop COVID-19 symptoms and
concomitant fear of propagating infection at work; uncertainty that their organization will
support/take care of their personal and family needs if they develop infection; access to childcare
during increased work hours and school closures; and support for other personal and family needs
as work hours and demands increase [11]. A recent qualitative study from China reported the
challenges facing frontline healthcare workers during the COVID-19 outbreak, including a high
risk of infection, insufficient PPE, heavy workloads and manpower shortages, confusion,
discrimination, isolation, separation from their families, and burnout [12]. Under these stressful
conditions, healthcare professionals have been challenged to effectively engaged in the fight
COVID-19.

A good level of understanding the risk perception and preventive practices of healthcare
professionals is essential to protect the health workers and prevent the COVID-19 pandemic
through effective risk communication. Studies conducted during the early stages of a pandemic
have suggested that perceived personal risk of infection and the health effects are linked to
engagement in protective behaviors [13]. Since the occurrence of the epidemic in Ethiopia, the

MoH, in collaboration with its partners, conducted different trainings on preventive measures for
healthcare professionals at several hospitals and health centers, with supplies of PPE materials.
However, so far, no study has been undertaken in Ethiopia on risk perception and preventive
practices of healthcare professionals during the current COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, levels
of confidence and feelings of healthcare workers about COVID-19 are unknown. It was therefore
necessary to carry out this study to investigate the level of risk perception and preventive practice
of healthcare professionals towards the COVID-19.

Methods
Study setting and design
This hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted from 9th to 26th June 2020 at six public
hospitals in Addis Ababa city administration, three months after the first confirmed COVID-19
case in Ethiopia in March 2020. Addis Ababa city is the most populated urban city in the country,
and had a population of about 3.6 million in 2019 [14]. The city also had better health infrastructure
and the highest number of qualified medical personnel compared with any city or region in the
country. There were 12 hospitals and close to 100 health centers belonging to the public center,
and about 25 private hospitals in Addis Ababa city. There were also over 17,000 healthcare
professionals in the city, including 2,441 (14%) physicians and 8,172 (47%) nurses by the end of
July 2019 (MOH 2011 EC Health Indicators). The hospitals selected for the current study provide
outpatient and inpatient services for the city residents and patients coming from different parts of
the country.

Study population and sampling
The study was conducted among all healthcare professionals working in the different clinical
departments or units of six public hospitals in Addis Ababa, mainly Gyn&Ob, Surgery, Pediatrics,
Internal Medicine, OPD, emergencies, intensive care, operation room/ward, screening/triage,
laboratory and anesthesia. The selected hospitals included: Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital
(TASH), Zewditu Memorial Hospital (ZMH), Ghandi Memorial Hospital (GMH), Menelik II
Hospital, Yekatit 12 Hospital Medical College (Y12HMC) and St. Paul Hospital Millennium
Medical College (SPHMMC). The study population included intern doctors, resident doctors,
general practitioners, medical specialists and sub-specialists, health officers, anesthetists, nurses,
midwives, pharmacists, laboratory technologists, physiotherapists, X-ray and laboratory
technicians, all of whom may expect to encounter suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients.

A multi-stage sampling, using a mix of purposive and non-random sampling, was applied to select
the study participants. In the first stage, the six hospitals were purposively selected from 12
hospitals in the city. In the second stage, clinical departments or units were selected, and in the
third stage, study participants were selected proportionally to the estimated number of healthcare
professionals working in different departments and units of the hospital. All eligible participants
in each department/unit who consented to participate were recruited into the study. Since COVID19 is a new disease, we assumed that at least 50% of study participants had higher risk perception
regarding COVID-19, and the estimated sample size was calculated with 95% confidence limit,
with 4% precision and a design effect equal to 1.5 using 20 % non-response rate. Accordingly, the
minimum total sample size targeted for this survey was 1,080 respondents. A total of 1,200
participants were targeted for the study.

Data Collection
A structured paper-based self-administered questionnaire was used to collect the data. The
questionnaire is composed of parts on the demographic (gender, age) and occupational
characteristics of the respondents (hospital, department/unit, professional category, and work
experience), as well as their preparedness to combat COVID-19, potential risk of becoming
infected with the virus, worries about the potential risk to their family and loved ones, feelings and
fears about COVID-19. Questions related to measures taken to prevent infection from the virus
included hand washing for at least 20 seconds, use of disinfectants, wearing facemask, physical
distancing, covering mouth and nose while coughing and sneezing and other preventive measures.
The questionnaire was developed in English by the authors of the study based on the previously
conducted studies and visiting the WHO websites for frequently asked questions on risk perception
of healthcare professionals. Most of the questions were designed as ‘yes/no’, ‘agree/disagree’, and
‘worried/not worried’ using different rating scales.

A total of 12 experienced data collectors with health backgrounds were involved in the data
collection of this survey. A guideline was developed by the research team to guide the data
collectors and supervisors for data collection, quality assurance of data and ethical conduct.
Training and orientation on the survey tool and methodology including how to administer the SAQ
were conducted for the data collectors using webinar on 2nd June 2020. After explaining the
purpose of the study and obtaining written or oral informed consent, study participants were given
a paper-based questionnaire at their workplace and they filled out their own questionnaires. The
purpose of the study was clearly stated in the questionnaire and the participants were asked to
complete the questionnaire with honest answers after giving their consents. The study participants

were encouraged to fill out the questionnaire whilst the data collectors were still in the hospital
during the data collection period. A collection center was also prepared in the Hospital Director’s
office to also gather the questionnaires from the healthcare workers that were unable to directly
deliver the completed questionnaires to the data collectors. The data collection took place
simultaneously in the six hospitals. The questionnaires were checked for completeness and
consistency upon collection. All responses were anonymous.

Risk perception among the healthcare professionals in this study was measured using questions on
perceived fears and worries, vulnerability and feelings, and behavioral responses regarding
COVID-19 [15-16]. Preventive practices of COVID-19 in this study include hygiene behaviors
(such as hand washing; covering mouth and nose with a hand or tissue while coughing or sneezing;
avoiding touching eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands; using hand sanitizer; disinfecting
surfaces); mask wearing, physical distancing and avoiding crowds and public places [17].

Data analysis
Data were entered into the Census Surveys Professional (CSPro) Version 7.2 statistical software
package and subsequently exported to SPSS version 23.0 (SPSS Inc., IBM, USA) for cleaning and
data analysis. Descriptive analysis was applied to calculate the frequencies, proportions and mean
scores, and the results were presented as a proportion for the categorical variables, and as a mean
± standard deviation for the quantitative variables. A Chi-square was used to establish significance
and relationship between variables. The study participants were asked 12 questions related to their
fears and worries (risk perception) about COVID-19, such as losing someone they love due to the
disease, health system overcrowding, mental and physical health, etc., on a 3-point scale, where

1=don’t worry at all, 2=worry somehow and 3=worry a lot. A sum of scores (ranged 12-36) was
made and the level was classified into two groups using the Visual Binning in SPSS (low
fear/worry ≤29 and high fear/worry >29 score). Univariate odds ratios (crude OR) and multivariate
odds ratio (adjusted OR) were derived by using univariate and multivariate logistic regression
models, respectively, to identify the main factors associated with healthcare workers high risk
perception. Statistical significance was considered for P<0.05. The internal consistency
(reliability) of the questions was tested by applying Cronbach’s alpha and the Cronbach’s alpha
coefficient of the reliability of scale was estimated at 0.91, which is highly acceptable.

Ethical considerations
The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of the College
of Health Sciences at Addis Ababa University (AAU). Permission to undertake this study was
obtained from every relevant authority at all levels. Official letters from AAU were written to each
hospital to cooperate and participate in the survey. The purpose and significance of the study was
introduced to the study participants, and all participants provided written or oral consent before
participating in the study. Anonymity and data confidentiality were ensured, and no identifiable
data from participants were collected. All study respondents were asked to only fill the
questionnaire once to avoid duplication of data and that their participation in the study was entirely
on voluntary basis. All personnel involved in the survey received orientation on COVID-19
infection prevention and control measures.

Results
Characteristics of study participants
A total of 1,134 (92%) healthcare professionals consented and completed the questionnaires, out
of 1,228 possible participants from six public hospitals in Addis Ababa. Among 1,134 healthcare
personnel, nearly 40% of them were nurses, followed by physicians (22.4%) and interns (10.8%).
Table 1 summarizes the demographic and occupational characteristics of the study participants and
their professional affiliation. Among 1,102 respondents reporting gender, 45.9% were males, with
females making 51.3% of all respondents. Among 982 participants with available data on age, the
mean (±SD) age was 30.3±6.4 years and ranged from 22 to 70 years old, with the majority within
the age group of 20-29 years (57.9%) (31.0±5.6 years for physicians, 25.6±3.3 years for interns
and 30.7±6.5 years for nurses). Among 252 physicians participated in the study, general
practitioners and resident doctors accounted for 44.8% and 42.9%, respectively, while medical
specialists and sub-specialists accounted for the remaining 12.3%. About 17% of the respondents
represented other professional categories such as anesthetist, pharmacist, health officer,
radiographer and laboratory technologist. Majority (17.2%) of the respondents worked in Gny&Ob
department, while 13.8% were in surgical department, 13.3% in pediatrics, 13.0% in medical and
10.5% in OPD departments. Most respondents worked as staff for less than 10 years in the hospital
(73.2%), and nearly 10% worked for 10 or more years.

COVID-19 preventive practices

The self-reported prevalence of different preventive measures practiced by healthcare
professionals to prevent themselves from coronavirus infection is shown in Table 2. The overall
highest practice showed among healthcare participants were wearing facemask (93%), hand
washing for at least 20 seconds (92.7%), covering mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing
(90.9%), and avoiding touching eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands (90.5%). These

measures were commonly reported (>90%) for physicians, intern doctors, nurses and other
healthcare professionals except the midwives who reported <90%. A lower percentage of selfreported practices were observed in physical distancing (84.3%), the use of disinfecting surfaces
(76.1%), and staying home when feeling cold or sick (64.6%), with similar pattern across the
different categories of healthcare workers.

This study also investigated the attitude of the healthcare workers with regard to which group of
people they recommend to use a facemask or N95 respirator. The vast majority of the respondents
(94.8%) recommended the use of a facemask by all healthcare professionals, all healthy people to
protect themselves from coronavirus infection (90.1%), and people with close contact with
suspected or confirmed COVID-19 (88.8%). About 87% of all respondents suggested that N95
respirator should be used by all healthcare professionals as well as by people who are being in

close contact with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients. About five in 10 (48%) of the
respondents recommended the use of N95 respirator by healthy people to protect themselves
against coronavirus infection. About 65% and 48% of the respondents from TASH and SPHMMC,
respectively, recommended the use of N95 respirator for all healthy people to protect themselves
from COVID-19.

Exposure and preparedness in providing care to COVID-19 and other infectious disease
outbreaks
Only about one-third (30.7%) of the study participated reported that they ever participated in direct
clinical care to patients affected by infectious disease outbreaks such as Ebola, SARS and cholera.
Nearly three in 10 (28.9%, n=328) respondents reported that they ever provided direct clinical care
to at least one suspected/confirmed COVID-19 patient, with 39.1% participants from SPHMMC,
34.5% from MH and 31.1% from TASH. Regarding the level of preparedness of healthcare
professionals to provide direct clinical care to COVID-19 patients, 33.6% (n=381) reported that
they were prepared to provide direct clinical care to COVID-19 patients. In contrast, about twothird (66.4%) of the healthcare workers reported that they were not prepared to manage COVID19 patients.

Risk perception of healthcare professionals due to their role in the COVID-19 pandemic

The study participants were asked questions about their personal health, potential risks of
becoming infected with COVID-19 or the potential risks to their families and loved ones due to
their clinical role in the hospital. About 30% and 43% of the participants somewhat or strongly
worried, respectively, that their personal health is at risk during the COVID-19 pandemic due to
their role in the hospital (Table 3). Nevertheless, 6% and 13.5% of respondents reported that they

somewhat not worried or even not worried at all that their personal health was not at risk due to
COVID-19. About 38% and 50% of all respondents perceived that they were somewhat worried
or extremely worried about themselves, respectively, due to the potential risk of becoming infected
with coronavirus by their clinical role in the hospital setting these days, with only 5.6% perceived
that they were not worried about the risk of being infected with the virus. Majorities of the
respondents (64.4%) extremely worried about the potential risk of infection to their family and
loved ones, and the remaining 26.7% were somewhat worried. Only 4.4% of the respondents were
not worried about the risk of COVID-19 to their family and loved ones.

The study participants were asked 12 questions to quantify their fears and worries (risk perception)
about COVID-19 crisis, on a 3-point scale, where 1=don’t worry at all, 2=worry somehow and
3=worry a lot. Of the total 1134 study participants, 952 (84%) had complete responses on all the
12-items for computing the total score. About 66% of the respondents reported that they worried
a lot about losing someone due to COVID-19, 66.7% worried a lot about the health of their loved
ones, and 67.5% worried a lot about the health system being overloaded by the patients of COVID19, followed by a lot of worries about the economic recession in the country (58%), and restricted
access to food supplies (56.1%) (Table 4). The study also revealed that there were respondents
who were ambivalent or didn’t worry at all about COVID-19 crisis.

An overall fear and worry index about COVID-19 was created using 12 questions. The overall
score for the scale was calculated by summing up the score of all questions (from 12 to 36). The
higher the score, the greater the fear and worry of the COVID-19. Table 5 presents the mean scores
for each and the overall worry indicators of COVID-19 crisis by professional category. Overall,
the participants reported an average of moderate-to-high levels of COVID-19 worry (2.37) on each
item, ranging from 2.1 on ‘becoming unemployed’ to 2.6 on ‘losing someone they love’, ‘health
system being overloaded’ and ‘someone’s loved health’. The overall average worry score of the
12 items for the COVID-19 crisis was high, with a mean (±SD) of 28.4 (±5.9), ranging from 12 to
36. The total average fear and worry scores for the hospitals ranged from 25.6 (±6.8) at TASH to
31.3 (±5.0) at GMH; and was further categorized into three levels i.e. low, moderate, and high fear
and worry level. Figure 1 shows the pattern of the total fear and worry scores of COVID-19 crisis,
and about 56% of respondents from TASH showed a relatively low fear and worry score compared
to the highest (50.9%) fear and worry score reported by participants from GMH.

The total fear and worry scores of COVID-19 was finally changed into binary using the Visual
Binning in SPSS (low fear/worry ≤29 and high fear/worry >29 score). Table 6 shows the results
of bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses of predictors associated with
respondents mean scores of fears and worries about COVID-19 crisis. In the bivariate analyses
departments/units and the hospitals were significantly associated with fear and worry scores of
COVID-19 crises. Nurses were 1.52 times more likely to report fear and worry (OR=1.52, 95%
CI:1.09-2.13, P<0.015), and healthcare workers who ever participated in clinical care to Ebola,
SARS and cholera patients were 0.67 times less likely to report fear and worry due to COVID-19
crisis (OR=1.67, 95% CI:0.51-0.88, P<0.005).

In the multivariable logistic regression analyses, hospitals retained the statistical significance for
the fear and worry score, where respondents from TASH (adjusted OR=0.49, 95% CI:0.32-0.75,
P=0.001) and Y12HMC (adjusted OR=0.52, 95% CI:0.32-0.84, P=0.008) were less likely to report
fear and worry about COVID-19 crisis (Table 6). In contrast, respondents from GMH were more
likely to fear and worry for COVID-19 crisis (adjusted OR=1.77, 95% CI:1.10-3.18) than those
from the SPHMMC respondents. Healthcare professionals ever provided clinical care to suspected/
confirmed COVID-19 patients were 1.34 times more likely to report fear and worry due to COVID19 crises (OR=1.34, 95% CI:1.02-1.91, P=0.037), however respondents who ever participated in
clinical care to Ebola, SARS and cholera patients were 0.66 times less likely to report fear and
worry due to COVID-19 crisis (OR=0.66, 95% CI:0.48-0.90, P=0.009). Gender, professional
category and preparedness to provide direct care to COVID-19 patients did not appear significant
in the multivariable logistic regression model to predict the odds of fear and worry score for
COVID-19 crisis.

Discussion
Since its emergence in December 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic is a global public health concern
and the most current topic of discussion across every facet of life, especially among the healthcare
professionals and patients. This study was conducted in Addis Ababa city during 09-26 June 2020,
three months after detection of the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Ethiopia. Addis Ababa
city is the most affected part in the country. The study aimed to assess the risk perceptions and
protective behaviors of COVID-19 among healthcare professionals in the city. Our study
participants include medical doctors, interns, nurses, midwives, pharmacists, medical laboratory
technologists, and technicians. These categories of healthcare professionals have direct or indirect

close personal exposures with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients while performing their
clinical duties.

The overwhelming majority of the participants in our study reported a high level of practice
towards the prevention of COVID-19 infection particularly regarding using facemask, hand
washing for at least 20 seconds, covering mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing, and
avoiding touching eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands as far as possible. This finding is
consistent with the finding of a similar study conducted in China, where the risk of spread of
COVID-19 has largely improved the infection prevention and control behaviors of healthcare
professionals working in hospitals [18]. In a study conducted in Egypt, hand washing, refraining
from touching eyes, mouth and nose, and using surgical facemask were the most frequently
accepted preventive measures among health workers [19]. The WHO recommends the use of
primary preventive measures that includes regular hand washing, social distancing, and respiratory
hygiene (covering mouth and nose while coughing or sneezing) by healthcare workers in order to
prevent the spread of the virus among themselves and patient’s close contacts [20].

Studies conducted during the early stage of the pandemic revealed that healthcare workers had
insufficient knowledge about COVID-19 pandemic to protect themselves from coronavirus
infection [21]. In one study in Greece, only 25% of healthcare practitioners washed their hands
after touching a patient, despite the fact that 94% of the respondents knew that SARS-CoV-2
transmission could be reduced with hand washing [22]. Although hand washing is recommended
for the general public in order to prevent the transmission of COVID-19, hand hygiene is
mandatory for health care practitioners, in order to prevent infections, both for oneself and for the

patients [23]. In the present study, the use of facemask was reported to be 93%. A recent study
conducted in Addis Ababa just before our study revealed that about two-third of the healthcare
workers demonstrated a poor practice of facemask utilization [24]. Similar results were reported
in North-East India that majority of the healthcare workers (91%) reported that they used surgical
masks, 97% were using hand sanitizer and 97% participants were properly using hand hygiene
[25].

In the present study, the majority of the study participants recommended mask-wearing by all
healthcare professionals, all healthy people to protect themselves from coronavirus infection, and
people with close contact with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Similarly, about 87% of the
respondents suggested that N95 respirator should be used by all healthcare professionals as well
as by people who are being in close contact with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients. In
Pakistan, 71% of the healthcare workers believed that wearing general medical masks was
protective against COVID-19 [26], and studies also suggested that surgical masks are similarly as
effective as N95 respirators if used with hand wash and other infection prevention precautions
[27]. However, a rapid systematic review on the efficacy of facemasks and respirators against
coronaviruses and other respiratory transmissible viruses reported that continuous use of
respirators is more protective compared to the medical masks, and medical masks are more
protective than cloth masks among health workers in healthcare settings [28].

This study demonstrated that about one-third of all respondents in our study either participated in
direct clinical care to patients affected by an infectious disease outbreak (e.g., Ebola virus, SARS,
cholera, Zika virus) (31%) or provided direct clinical care at least for one suspected or confirmed
COVID-19 patients (29%) during the current COVID-19 epidemic. This percentage is higher from

other studies on this subject in the early days of the COVID-19 outbreak in China [29]. A
significant number (38%) of healthcare professionals in the current study expressed lack of or low
level of preparedness to manage suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients. This raises a concern
regarding the ability and confidence of the healthcare workers to combat COVID-19 infection.
Despite these concerns, along with the shortage of PPE and inadequate training during the COVID19, the healthcare workers continue to work with the management of suspected or confirmed
COVID-19, working in the hospital setting where COVID-19 patients were admitted, risking their
lives to save their patients. However, this could highlight the risk of infection among healthcare
workers and cross-contamination within hospitals and could lead to a higher rate of hospitalacquired infections. Therefore, our study provides considerable insights into the necessity of
immediate and determined efforts focused on training programs and providing an adequate supply
of PPE to ensure the safety of health personnel during the COVID-19 pandemic [30].

In the present study, about 88% of the healthcare professionals were afraid of being infected with
the disease and about 91% were worried about the potential risk of transmitting the virus to their
family and loved ones. The risk of contracting the virus was perceived to be very high at the time
of the study. Healthcare workers expressed worry and fear of infection due to the contagious nature
of the virus, close contact with suspected and confirmed COVID-19 patients, and infection
happening to their family and colleagues. In Iran, it was found that about 92% of the healthcare
workers worried about being infected with the virus and transmitting it to the family [31]. In a
study conducted in Henan province of China, 89% of healthcare workers had sufficient knowledge
of COVID-19, 85% were concerned about infection with the virus, and 90% followed correct
practices regarding the prevention of COVID-19 [32]. About 83% of the healthcare workers in
Egypt reported increased risk perception because of the concern of being infected with COVID24

19 and fear of transmitting the disease to their families, and 89% stated that they were more
susceptible to COVID-19 infection mainly due to the shortage of PPE [19].

In the current study, the overall risk perception expressed in fear and worry score of the study
participants regarding COVID-19 crisis was considerably higher, with a mean of 28, ranging from
12 to 36. Various studies have reported the psychological impact of COVID-19 on healthcare
professionals [33]. A recent scoping review found that the frontline healthcare workers are at an
increased risk of direct physical and mental consequences as the result of providing care to patients
with COVID-19 [34]. Studies demonstrated that more than 50% of healthcare professionals report
symptoms of depression, insomnia, and anxiety due to COVID-19 [35]. A recent study carried out
in Pakistan on fear and anxiety among healthcare professionals reported that about three-fourth of
them had fear of getting infected during the management of COVID-19 patients, and another twothird reported severe anxiety, which was particularly more common among nurses [36]. Studies
also reported excessive workload, isolation, mental stress and discrimination among frontline
health professionals, thus, contributing to physical exhaustion, emotional disturbance, worry and
fear [37]. A Cochrane review reported the suffering of healthcare workers from work-related or
occupational stress, which can be reduced by cognitive-behavioral training as well as mental and
physical relaxation [38]. A multicenter study conducted among frontline nurses in China showed
poor mental health during the COVID-19 outbreak, mainly due to the fear of contracting the virus
and high workload [39]. Moreover, the same study revealed that nurses who were confident in
their infection control knowledge and skills had lower stress levels than those who felt less
prepared.

Finally, this study had several limitations. First, the study had a potential to be affected by selection
bias and eligible participants might be excluded. Second, this study was conducted in six public
hospitals in Addis Ababa, and may possibly limit the generalization of the results and findings to
other public and private hospitals. Third, the study focused on more general populations of
healthcare professionals similar to other studies [32,40] rather than healthcare workers who might
have direct contact with COVID-19 patients [41]. At last, the results of this study are based on
self-reported data, and the respondents may overestimate or underestimate the responses in a way
that they believe is socially acceptable rather than reporting actual or genuine answers. Despite
these limitations, the results obtained provide important information to guide health
communication efforts that can support prevention efforts of COVID-19 among healthcare
professionals.

Conclusions
In conclusion, our study has illuminated the current level of risk perception and preventive
practices of COVID-19 among healthcare professionals, with a special focus on those working in
the clinical departments of the hospitals who have direct or indirect contact with COVID-19
patients. The present study findings demonstrated that healthcare professionals participated in the
study showed a universally higher preventive practices to prevent COVID-19 infections. The
healthcare workers perceived high level of COVID-19 risk particularly due to shortage of PPE,
and majority reported that they didn’t receive any training in infection prevention and control
measures since COVID-19, although they had adequate level of practice to protect themselves
from the infection of novel coronavirus. Likewise, majority of the participants reported that they
worried about the potential risk of becoming infected with COVID-19 and transmitting the disease
