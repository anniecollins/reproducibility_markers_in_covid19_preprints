ABSTRACT

The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, originating from Wuhan, China in
early December, has infected more than 70,000 people in China and other countries and has
caused more than 2,000 deaths. As the disease continues to spread, the biomedical society
urgently began identifying effective approaches to prevent further outbreaks. Through rigorous
epidemiological analysis, we characterized the fast transmission of COVID-19 with a basic
reproductive number 5.6 and proved a sole zoonotic source to originate in Wuhan. No changes in
transmission have been noted across generations. By evaluating different control strategies
through predictive modeling and Monte carlo simulations, a comprehensive quarantine in
hospitals and quarantine stations has been found to be the most effective approach. Government
action to immediately enforce this quarantine is highly recommended.

INTRODUCTION

The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, originated in Wuhan, a city
located in central China, in early December, is fast spreading to more than 30 countries
(Benvenuto et al., 2020; She et al., 2020). In less than 3 months, the disease has infected more
than 70,000 people globally, and has caused more than 2,000 deaths. On January 30th, 2020, the
World Health Organization declared COVID-19 as a public health emergency of international
concern. Upon composing this manuscript, the coronavirus is concurrently spreading and
claiming more than 100 lives per day. This outbreak induces an urgency to determine the
characteristics of COVID-19 transmission and implement optimal strategies to control the
epidemic.
Coronavirus is an enveloped, positive-sense, single stranded RNA virus found in a variety
of mammals, including bats, civets, camel, and pangolins (Ge et al., 2013; Kandeil et al., 2019;
Liu et al., 2007; Rockx et al., 2011). Two strains of coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-1 and MERSCoV, have been reported to cause severe respiratory syndromes, resulting in deadly epidemics in
2002 and 2012, respectively (Fung and Liu, 2019; Luk et al., 2019). This current coronavirus,
denoted as SARS-CoV-2, is the seventh known coronavirus to infect humans. (Benvenuto et al.,
2020).
To effectively fight and end the COVID-19 epidemic, the transmission of the disease and
zoonotic source of origin must be accurately identified, leading to the discovery of an optimal
strategy to control this outbreak. By studying the cases and clinical features from early reports,
this paper illustrates rigorous epidemiological models and the associated statistical methods to

estimate the transmission rates in different stages and scenarios and predict the outcomes for
different control strategies.

METHODS

Data sources
The numbers of cases from January 21st to February 20th, 2020 were obtained from the
daily reports by National Health Commission (NHC) of China. As NHC did not release case
reports until January 21st, the case numbers prior to January 21st were obtained from two recent
clinical reports (Huang et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020). The number of patients diagnosed out of
Wuhan was obtained from the report by (Guan et al., 2020) which summarized 1,099 cases
confirmed by January 29th, 2020. The case numbers for the Diamond Princess Cruise were obtained
from the daily reports by Yokohama Port Quarantine Center.

SEIQ model
A susceptible-exposed-infectious-quarantine model was used for transmission analysis and
prediction of epidemiological spread,

where S, E, I, Q and N were the number of susceptible (S), exposed (E), infectious (I),
quarantined (Q) and total population. The population in Wuhan (N) is 11,081,000. Assuming that
a patient was quarantined immediately after the diagnosis was confirmed, Q was equal to the
confirmed number of cases. β is the daily transmission rate, defined as the expected number of
infections caused by one infectious person per day. Once a susceptible (S) person becomes
infected, the status is changed to exposed for an incubation period, 1/α. Theoretically, the patient
is not infectious during the incubation period. After incubation, the patient experiences disease
onset and becomes infectious (I). The time interval between disease onset to quarantine (Q) is the
infectious time, 1/γ.

Estimating transmission
Because the SEIQ model cannot be solved explicitly, β was estimated using the Monte
carlo method, which simulated the two independent Poisson processes: daily exposed cases and
the individual incubation time. To estimate β, there are two scenarios to consider. Firstly, the
number of cases may only be available at the beginning and end of the study period. The
examples used were the Diamond Princess Cruise and Wuhan prior to January 20th when the
diagnosis kit was not sufficiently available. In this scenario, β was estimated by Monte carlo
approximation of the number of cases at the end of the targeted time period. Secondly, the
number of Q is made available each day for the examples and the number of confirmed cases in
China after January 20th. In this scenario, γ was first determined from clinical reports for the
targeted time period, and then β was estimated by minimizing the mean squared errors from
1,000 Monte carlo samples that approximated the Q curve.

Epidemics prediction
To evaluate different control strategies, Monte carlo samples were generated given β, γ, initial
E, and initial I. The simulation was based on two independent Poisson processes: daily exposed

cases and the individual incubation time. The daily means and 95% confidence intervals for Q were
obtained over 1,000 Monte carlo runs.

RESULTS

The transmission in open cities
Epidemiological analysis was performed on data collected from the Mainland of China between
January 1st and January 20th, 2020. During this period, the suspected zoonotic source, the Huanan
Seafood Market, was closed and travel restrictions were not yet enforced by the government. Based
on the reported clinical analysis for the 425 cases prior to January 23rd, the average inoculation time
interval was found to be 5.2 days and the average time interval from disease onset to a clinical visit
was 5.8 days (Li et al 2020). In this study, the total number of cases, 8247, including both confirmed
and suspected patients, on January 26, 2020 were used as the number of onsets (I+E) for January
20th, 2020. In the same way, the total number of cases reported between January 1st and January 7th,
which totaled 136, was used as I0 in the SEIQ model. Because the SEIQ model cannot be solved
explicitly, Monte carlo simulation was exploited to determine the daily transmission rate β0=0.44
with 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.43 to 0.47 (Figure 1A). Given the mean time interval between
onset and hospital quarantine of 12.5 days, the basic reproductive number, R0, was estimated to be
5.5 (95% CI 5.3 to 5.8).

The transmission in an enclosed crowded environment
Most of infected cases in December 2019 were linked to the Huanan Seafood Market,
which retails seafood and wild animals. It is believed that an enclosed and crowded environment
is favorable for coronavirus transmission, however the epidemiological data is lacking. To test
the hypothesis, the recent Diamond Princess cruise epidemic was used as a comparable case
study. A clear disease outbreak was reported on this cruise. A passenger, who visited China on
January 10th, was on board from January 20th and January 25th before being confirmed with a
SARS-CoV-2 infection. All people on board have been quarantined at sea since February 5th and
621 out of 3711 people were confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2. As some of the patients were
known to be infected after the quarantine, possibly due to central air conditioning and family
infection, only the confirmed cases (n=135) by February 10th (five days incubation plus one day
diagnosis) were used for a conservative estimation of transmission. Using a SEIQ model while
Q=0, the daily transmission rate, β, was found to be 1.04 (95% CI 0.69-1.87) (Figure 1B), which is
twice as much as the transmission rate in open cities. Using the infection period of 12.5 days, the
effective reproductive number on the cruise, Rc, was 13.0 (95% CI 8.63-23.375).

A sole zoonotic source
The link between many of the December cases and the Huanan Seafood Market indicates
that the Huanan Seafood Market is one of the zoonotic origins of SARS-CoV-2, if not only.
After the forced shutdown of the Huanan Seafood Market on January 1st, the effectiveness of the
zoonotic infection and a potential secondary source of SARS-CoV-2 that continued to infect the
Wuhan people remained in question.

To characterize the zoonotic infection of COVID-19, a SEIQ model was constructed to
analyze for the epidemic from the Hunan Seafood Market in December 2019. The first SARSCoV-2 onset was found on December 1st 2019 (Huang et al., 2020), and by the 1st of January, 41
patients were confirmed and quarantined. Using the 5.8-day interval between disease onset and
clinical visit, 136 cases diagnosed in the first 6 days of January were included, bringing the total
number of infections to 177. Given β0=0.44, the development of the epidemic was simulated by
initializing with a range of numbers (from 1 to 5) of infections on December 1st using the SEIQ
model. It showed that at most one infected patient can be allowed in the model, which induced a
mean of 174 infections (95% CI 161-187) by January 1st. Instead of one, if two unrelated people
were infected by December 1st, the 95% CI would be (291, 318) on January 1st, significantly larger
than the expected 177 cases. Thus, the transmission would be so minimal that it would not
substantially contribute to the final number of infections, even if there existed a second zoonotic
source. In the same sense, the results did not support a continuous zoonotic source within the Huanan
Seafood Market, which would have resulted in a higher overall number of infections in the later
trajectory.

No transmission variations between generations
As an RNA virus, coronavirus conveys a high mutation rate (Benvenuto et al., 2020),
raising concerns whether the transmission would change between generations. The significantly
higher mortality rate observed in Wuhan suggested that the transmission may attenuate over
generations. To test this hypothesis, the patients infected in December 2019 were considered as
the first generation because most of the cases had links to the Huanan Market, while the patients
infected in January 2020 were considered the second-or-later generation. Given the data from
December (assuming there is only one case at the beginning of December), β was estimated to be

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.24.20026773; this version posted February 25, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

0.41 (95% CI 0.31-0.56) (Figure 1C), which was not significantly different from the transmission
rate β0=0.45, obtained between January 1st and 20th. Furthermore, the transmission rates between

Wuhan and other cities were also compared. Based on Guan et al’s analysis of 1,099 patients
confirmed by January 29th (Guan et al., 2020), 616 were identified outside of Wuhan. Out of the
616 patients193 had recently visited Wuhan. Using a mean infectious period of 5 days, β was
calculated to 0.438 (β=(616-193)/193/5=0.438), which was within the 95% confidence interval
of the previous estimation of β0 in Wuhan, 0.44 (95% CI 0.43-0.47). Therefore, no evidence of
attenuation of transmission was found.

Control strategies
Unprecedented measures were taken in Wuhan to stop the spread of COVID-19. Immediately
after the official announcement of the novel coronavirus, home isolations and personal protection
equipment such as face masks and gloves were enforced. Public transportation was limited and,
eventually, all canceled. On January 23rd, the government suspended all plane, train and bus travel in
and out of Wuhan. On February 2nd, a comprehensive quarantine strategy was taken by the Chinese
government. All home-isolated patients were mandated to be hospitalized in the newly built square
cabin hospitals, and all people who had suspected symptoms or had close contacts were demanded
for mandatory isolation in the quarantine stations. The effects of these steps may not be clear until
the end of the epidemic. Nevertheless, an intermediate analysis is needed for evaluating various
control strategies.

Considering the one-day delay in the quarantine of the patients in the square cabin hospitals, the
SEIQ model was used to fit the data into two phases, from January 23rd to February 2nd, and from
February 3rd to February 20th. In the first phase, γ was chosen to be 1/6 based on the analysis by

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.24.20026773; this version posted February 25, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

(Yang et al., 2020). Using least squared errors for an exhaustive search of β, the optimal
transmission rate became 0.54, which was greater than the basic transmission rate β0=0.44 (Figure
2A). In the second phase, the time interval from disease onset to quarantine was assumed to drop by
another 50% due to the implication of the square cabin hospitals. Thus, γ=1/6, the transmission rate β
decreased to 0.10, which was an 81.5% reduction from the first phase and a 77.3% reduction from
the basic transmission rate. In conclusion, the aggressive quarantine strategy of building square cabin
hospitals has effectively decreased the transmission, whereas the usefulness of the travel ban, home
isolation, and personal protection is still unclear.

To further investigate the timing of the comprehensive quarantine, given β=0.10 and γ=1/6,
simulated isolations were employed to track the numbers of confirmed cases (Q) at various starting
dates, January 1st, 10th, 20th, and 30th. The initial number of cases was estimated by the SEIQ model.
The predicted Q value was plotted on a logarithm scale up to February 29th (Figure 2B). It was noted
that all curves tended to stabilize after the quarantine measures, and the time interval to stabilization
increased as the number of initial cases increased. Beginning the quarantine on January 1st, 136 initial
cases were reported. Curve stabilization was achieved after about 10 days, with 235 cases reported at
the end of this period. January 10th started with approximately 1,250 cases and ended with 1,834
cases and January 20th started with about 8,250 and ended with about 12,000. The January 30th
quarantine took almost 20 days to reach stabilization, and the final number of cases, 62,635, was
nearly double the initial number of cases, 38,397. It was noted that the prediction was rather accurate
as illustrated by the small 95% CI (gray area), and the CI decreased to negligible as the initial
number of cases increased.

DISCUSSION

COVID-19 is spreading at a much higher rate and at a larger scale compared to the 2003
SARS epidemic. The basic reproductive number, R0, for SARS was determined to be 3 with 95%
CI being 2 to 4 (Dye and Gay, 2003). However, contrary to public knowledge, the earlier reports
from the COVID-19 outbreak provided a R0 number less than or equal to that for SARS (Li et al.,
2020; Wu et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020). This may have resulted from an inaccurate number of
clinical cases due to delayed clinical visits, overloading of clinical resources, and a low
sensitivity of the COVID-19 diagnosis kit. With more clinical reports published, the case
numbers were adjusted based on the information presented, which gave a more accurate
transmission estimation. The basic reproductive number for COVID-19 was then found to be 5.6,
which is substantially higher than that for SARS.

In an enclosed and crowded environment, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was thought to
significantly increase. The Diamond Princess Cruise provided an excellent case study as the
development of COVID-19 on the cruise line has a clear infectious source, exposure time,
quarantine time, and total number of infections. The transport of the virus through the central air
conditioning system and the ineffective quarantine of the ship’s crew, however, raised some
concerns. Nevertheless, a conservative estimation of transmission using only 50% of the
confirmed cases has proven the high transmission rate in an enclosed crowded ship. This
suggested that the initial offense within the Huanan Seafood Market could be at a high level.

The likely zoonotic origin also raised questions about additional sources other than the
Huanan Seafood Market. This argument was partially supported by several early cases with no

known links to the Huanan Seafood Market. Rigorous statistical models were used to test the
hypothesis of a second zoonotic source, and the development of case numbers did not support
this hypothesis. Though our model cannot completely exclude the possibility of additional
zoonotic sources, it suggested a minimal effect by such sources. Furthermore, the model did not
support the constant zoonotic infection within Huanan Seafood Market throughout December. If
the zoonotic transgression was sustained, a larger number of infected cases would have been
observed. Based on the data from the Diamond Process Cruise, the transmission rate was higher
in an enclosed and crowded place, like the Huanan Seafood Market. However, similar
transmission rate was observed in December as in January. This is likely due to the market’s
daytime only operating hours, reducing the contact time. This result further suggested similar
transmission rate between generations, which was confirmed by comparing the transmission in
Wuhan and other cities. High mutation rates have been observed in the genome sequences
collected from more than 100 human specimens. However, the effect that these mutations have
on transmission may not be observed in such a short time period.

The Chinese government took unprecedented measures to fight the new epidemic and those
measures raised global controversy for their necessity and effectiveness. The restrictive travel
ban and home isolation enforced in Wuhan was expected to largely decrease the transmission
and prevent further spread of the disease within weeks. Nevertheless, the coronavirus infection
was continuously increasing exponentially in late January and early February in Wuhan. In this
model, an increase in the transmission rate (from 0.44 to 0.54) was observed during this time
period. It suggested that the travel ban and home isolation cannot effectively prevent the disease
spread. This was likely due to the probable cross-contamination in the long waiting lines at the

clinics and the contagion among family members. The limited medical resources only allowed
patients with severe symptoms to be hospitalized. A low sensitivity of diagnosis further
increased the waiting time for a confirmed case. Insufficient hospital beds resulted in a large
number of home isolated patients, often leading to family infection. Observing the tremendous
epidemic, the Chinese government built square cabin hospitals with more than twenty thousand
beds and quickly moved all patients into these hospitals. All people with suspected symptoms or
with close patient contacts were isolated in the government-managed quarantine stations. This
comprehensive quarantine method has successfully reduced the transmission rate by 81.5%, and
also greatly shortened the infectious time interval. The analysis in this study showed that the
epidemic can be controlled within a few weeks if the comprehensive quarantine was conducted
on January 20th or earlier. Concurrently with the development of this manuscript, it was reported
that South Korea had more than 1,000 home isolations in the city of Daegu for a suspected
SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is highly recommended that other countries immediately quarantine
all suspected patients.

This model was developed using the cases up to February 20th. As the case numbers
increase, the transmission features may change and some of the assumptions, such as the
infectious period, may vary. The cases reported in Wuhan were known to be less than the actual
number in January due to overloading of clinical resources and the low sensitivity of diagnosis.
This study attempted to overcome these limitations by using the clinical information verified by
several reports and relying only on the beginning and ending cases. Therefore, this model tended
to reflect the real trend of this critical epidemic and it provides more convincing evidence to
guide the control of this disease by the government.

Figure 1. Estimation of the transmission rate β. For each β, 1,000 simulation runs were
conducted and the low (green) and high (red) bounds of the 95% confidence intervals were
plotted. The dashed blue lines indicated the 95% confidence interval of β for the targeted number
of cases. A. Simulation of β for the time period from January 1st to 20th in China. 8247 was the
total number of infectious (I) and exposed (E) on Jan. 20th. B. Simulation of β for the Diamond
Princess Cruise. 135 was the total number of infectious (I) and exposed (E) on February 4th. C.
Simulation of β for the time period from December 1st to January 1st in Wuhan. 135 was the
number of infectious (I) on Jan. 1st.

Figure 2. Simulation and prediction of the number of infections. A. The numbers of
confirmed cases (Q) were predicted from the SEIQ model. The 95% confidence interval (gray
area) were obtained from 1,000 Monte carlo runs. B. Simulations for quarantine were performed
at 4 different starting dates: January 1st, 10th, 20th, and 30th. The predicted number of confirmed
cases (Q) was plotted at the natural logarithm scale. The 95% confidence interval (gray area) for
each curve was provided.
