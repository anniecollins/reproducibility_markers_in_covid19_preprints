Summary

21

22

Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory

23

syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is pandemic. However, data concerning the

24

epidemiological features, viral shedding, and antibody dynamics

25

asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers and COVID-19 patients remain controversial.

26

We enrolled 193 subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Ningbo and Zhoushan,

27

Zhejiang, China from January 21 to March 6, 2020. All subjects were followed up to

28

monitor the dynamics of immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG against SARS-CoV-2. Of

29

those, 31 were asymptomatic carriers, 149 were symptomatic patients, and 14 were

30

presymptomatic patients. Compared to symptomatic patients, asymptomatic carriers

31

were younger and had higher levels of white blood cell and lymphocyte, lower levels

32

of C-reactive protein and viral load, and shorter viral shedding duration. Conversion

33

of IgM from positive to negative was shorter in asymptomatic carriers than in

34

COVID-19 patients (P=0.030). The proportion of those persistently seropositive for

35

IgG was higher in COVID-19 patients than in asymptomatic carriers (P=0.037). Viral

36

load was higher in symptomatic than presymptomatic patients. Viral shedding was

37

longer in presymptomatic patients than in asymptomatic carriers. Conclusively,

38

asymptomatic carriers have a higher antiviral immunity to clear SARS-CoV-2 than do

39

symptomatic patients and this antiviral immunity is not contributable to humoral

40

immunity.

INTRODUCTION

46

47

Novel coronavirus disease in 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory

48

syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has being pandemic since it was firstly

49

recognized in China in late December 2019 [1]. The case number keeps increasing.

50

Globally, as of 9:42am CET, December 11, 2020, there have been 68,845,368

51

confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 1,570,304 deaths, reported to World Health

52

Organization [2]. Family clustering and hospital-based transmission were the two

53

major epidemiological features of this outbreak at the early stage, and continued to be

54

an important cause of community-based SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a low

55

prevalence region [3-6]. COVID-19 patients and asymptomatic carriers are the main

56

sources of SARS-CoV-2 infection but might have differences in some features [7].

57

However, data concerning SARS-CoV-2 transmission and viral shedding duration

58

between COVID-19 patients and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers remain

59

controversial. It has been summarized from early studies that viral load of

60

asymptomatic carriers is comparable to symptomatic patients [8]. In another study, it

61

has been demonstrated that a considerably higher viral load is present in samples from

62

fatal cases compared to asymptomatic carriers [9]. Difference in the dynamics of

63

antibody against SARS-CoV-2 between asymptomatic carriers and COVID-19

64

patients remains unknown. To provide the information for recognizing differences

65

between asymptomatic and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects, we

66

conducted a study to investigate the epidemiological feature, laboratory findings, viral

67

shedding, and antibody conversion of SARS-CoV-2 infected cases among

68

asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers and symptomatic/presymptomatic COVID

69

patients in two cities, a low prevalence region in Zhejiang, China.

METHODS

72

73

Study design and patients

74

75

It is an ambispective cohort study. The study enrolled all confirmed cases with

76

SARS-CoV-2 infection on Ningbo city and a familial clustering infection with

77

SARS-Co-2 in Putuo district of Zhoushan city from January 21 to March 6, 2020.

78

Epidemiological, clinical characteristics, pathogen and serological test results were

79

collected by Ningbo Municipal Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Ningbo

80

CDC) and CDC of Putuo district, Zhoushan (Putuo CDC). Some baseline information

81

including demographic and pathogenic data of those patients were reported [10, 11].

82

After that, we continued to investigate viral load and viral shedding of SARS-CoV-2,

83

laboratory tests, and the dynamics of serum immunoglobulin M (IgM) and

84

immunoglobulin G (IgG) against SARS-CoV-2 between asymptomatic carriers and

85

COVID-19 patients. All patients were followed up to monitor the dynamics of IgM

and IgG against SARS-CoV-2. Those with antibody tests for two times or more

87

within 160 days were included in antibody seroconversion analysis. Diagnoses and

88

disease staging of COVID-19 were carried out according to the Protocol for the

89

Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 (Version 7th), National Health Commission of

90

the People’s Republic of China [12]. Specifically, COVID-19 was diagnosed if the

91

patient was tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA and accompanied by

92

clinical symptoms including fever and cough. Asymptomatic carrier was identified in

93

close contactors of COVID-19 patients if they did not have any symptom. We also

94

classified as COVID-19 patients with onset of disease and those during the incubation

95

period (presymptomatic). All diagnosed COVID-19 patients were classified as mild,

96

common, severe, and extremely severe types. This study was approved by the Ethics

97

Commissions of Ningbo CDC and Putuo CDC. Written informed consent was waived

109

population gatherings were recorded as well.

110

111

Clinical information included the date of symptom onset and admission to designated

112

hospitals, clinical manifestation, routine laboratory examinations, and radiographic

113

examinations. The clinical manifestations, chest computed tomography images, and

114

laboratory results of patients in Ningbo were collected from the electronic medical

115

record systems in the two designated hospitals: Ningbo First Hospital and Huamei

116

Hospital. The information of patients from Zhoushan was collected from Zhoushan

117

Maternal and Child Health Care Hospital and Putuo Hospital. Two researchers (PL

118

and YD) independently reviewed all of the data to doubly check the accuracy of data

Detection of antibodies against SARS-COV-2

135

136

IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2 in the frozen reserved fasting serum samples were

137

detected using the diagnostic enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. The

138

diagnostic kits used for Ningbo patients and Zhoushan patients were manufactured by

139

Innovita Biological Technology (Tangshan, China) and Nanjing Wending Biotech

140

Company (Nanjing, China), respectively [15]. Briefly, testing results by Innovita

141

ELISA kits were determined by the color reaction. Dark band was considered positive.

142

Light band indicated weak positive. Disappearance of the expected band was

143

considered negative. Testing results by Wending ELISA kits were presented as

144

OD/CO. Sample was positive if the ratio of optical density (OD) to the cut-off value

145

(CO) was equal or greater than 1 and negative if the ratio was less than 1. A higher

146

OD/CO value indicated a higher level of antibody concentration.

178

Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers were significantly younger than symptomatic

179

COVID-19 patients and presymptomatic COVID-19 patients. Compared to

180

symptomatic COVID-19 patients, asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers had higher

181

levels of circulating white blood cell (WBC) and lymphocyte, lower levels of

182

C-reactive protein (CRP) and viral load, and shorter viral shedding time. Interestingly,

183

viral load was significantly lower in presymptomatic COVID-19 patients than in

184

symptomatic COVID-19 patients. The viral shedding duration was significantly

185

longer in presymptomatic COVID-19 patients than in asymptomatic carriers. The

186

first-time serological tests showed that nearly one-third of asymptomatic carriers and

187

symptomatic COVID-19 patients were seronegative for IgM against SARS-CoV-2

188

while the seronegative rates for IgG to SARS-CoV-2 were around 7% in the two

189

populations, respectively (Table 1).

198

(47.5%) COVID-19 patients (P=0.647). However, the median time interval of IgM

asymptomatic carriers, which was significantly shorter than 25.50 (IQR, 6.75-56.75)

201

days in COVID-19 patients (P=0.030). SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG seroconversion

202

from positive to negative or weak positive occurred in 8 (53.4%) asymptomatic

203

carriers, while this occurred in 15 (25.5%) COVID-19 patients (P=0.059). Importantly,

204

5 (33.3%) of asymptomatic carriers were consistently seropositive for IgG against

205

SARS-CoV-2, however, this was 39 (66.1%) in COVID-19 patients (P=0.037).

206

Furthermore, there was no significant difference in the time interval of IgG

207

seroconversion between the two groups (Table 2, Figure 1).

Intrafamilial transmission of SARS-CoV-2

210

211

Four family clusters were recorded in the study, 3 from Ningbo and 1 from Zhoushan.

212

A total of 15 subjects (7 asymptomatic carriers and 8 COVID-19 patients) were

213

confirmed to be infected by SARS-CoV-2 in the 4 familial clusters. Of the 7

214

asymptomatic carriers, 3 were children at the age of 12 years or younger, 3 adults

215

aged from 18 to 60 years, and a 75-year-old woman. Of the 8 COVID-19 cases, 4

216

were older than 60 years and diagnosed as severe cases, 3 of the 4 severe cases had

217

underlying diseases. The remaining 4 were mild patients at the age between 18 and 60

218

years. Only one of the 4 mild cases had an underlying disease. Although intra-familial

219

transmission was the major cause of acquiring

220

proportion of those who acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection via intra-familial

221

transmission was significantly higher in asymptomatic carriers than in COVID-19

222

patients (89% vs. 61%, P=0.028) (Figure 2). In the familial cluster in Putuo, the index

case’s wife who acquired the infection from his husband had a typical dynamic

224

feature in antibodies. The titers of IgM and IgG started to decrease after nearly a

SARS-CoV-2 infection, the

month’s increase after the exposure, and then increased again (Figure 3). The second

226

increase in IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2 was correlated to the time that she took

care of her parents who had severe COVID-19 in the hospital.

229

Discussion

230

231

To characterize the epidemiological features including immunological response, viral

232

transmission, and antibody seroconversion in asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers,

233

we made a comprehensive comparison between asymptomatic carriers and

234

COVID-19 patients in this study. Compared to symptomatic COVID-19 patients,

235

asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers were younger and had higher levels of

236

circulating WBC and lymphocyte and a lower level of CRP. These data indicate that

237

asymptomatic carriers have a stronger antiviral immunity and a lower level of

238

systemic inflammation. It has been proven that innate and adaptive lymphocytes and

239

inflammatory factors were closely related to disease progression of COVID-19, from

240

mild to severe [16, 17]. In a previous prospective study, we have demonstrated that

241

lower circulating counts of T lymphocytes, CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells as well as

242

higher circulating levels of neutrophil proportion, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio,

243

interleukin-6, CRP, and procalcitonin facilitate the progression of COVID-19. Of

244

those, CD8+ T cell exhaustion plays an important role in the pathogenesis of

245

COVID-19 [18]. Other studies have also shown that disease severity is negatively

246

associated with NK cells and CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T lymphocyte levels, while

247

intensive expansion of highly cytotoxic effector T cell subsets, such as CD4+

248

effector-granulysin, CD8+ effector-granulysin, and NKT CD160, is associated with

249

convalescence of COVID-19 patients [19-21]. These evidences strongly indicate that

250

damage of innate immunity and T cell-mediated immunity, which might be caused by

251

proinflammatory factor-induced inflammation, play key roles in the development of

252

COVID-19.

253

254

In this study, we also found that around 7% of asymptomatic carriers and COVID-19

255

patients during or after the incubation were seronegative for IgG against SARS-CoV-2,

256

indicating SARS-CoV-2 infection might not induce sufficient humoral immunity

257

against SARS-CoV-2. In the follow-up study, IgM seroconversion from positive to

258

negative was much faster in asymptomatic carriers than in COVID-19 patients

259

(P=0.030). The overall rate of IgG seroconversion from positive to negative or weak

260

positive was around 30% within 160 days after the diagnosis (Table 2), indicating that

261

IgG against SARS-CoV-2 is not stable. Virus-specific IgG decayed substantially in

262

most individuals [22]. This was also observed in Importantly, seroconversion of IgG

263

against SARS-CoV-2 from positive to negative or weak positive occurred 53.4% in

264

asymptomatic carriers and 25.5% in COVID-19 patients (P=0.059), while

265

consistently seropositive rate of IgG against SARS-CoV-2 was significantly higher in

266

COVID-19 patients than in asymptomatic carriers (P=0.037). The similar

267

observations concerning rapid seroconversion of the antibody against SARS-CoV-2 or

268

short-lived immune response after mild infection were also reported in the frontline

269

health care personnel in the US and active workers in France [23, 24]. These data

270

indicate that humoral immunity against SARS-CoV-2 was not efficiently aroused by a

271

relative short exposure of SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic carriers or in those with a

272

stronger innate and cell immunity. Long-term seropositive rate of antibody against

273

SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients, which has been previously reported [25, 26],

274

indicates the feasibility of antibody-generating vaccination in the worldwide

275

prophylactic effort. However, repeat exposure to the same virus may arouse a higher

276

humoral immunity. A family cluster occurred in Putuo, Zhoushan should be a suitable

277

example to address this issue (Figure 3). The index patient’s wife should be once

278

more infected by the same SARS-CoV-2 from her patients, because both antibodies

279

increased again after declined. Our data imply that boosting vaccination with

280

SARS-CoV-2 might be important.

281

282

Interestingly, compared to COVID-19 patients, asymptomatic carriers had a lower

283

level of viral load and shorter viral shedding time (Table 1). Our finding is different

284

from a study carried out in Chongqing that asymptomatic carriers had a significantly

285

longer duration of viral shedding than the symptomatic patients, possibly because

286

asymptomatic carriers contained presymptomatic patients in the reported study [27].

287

In this study, we confirmed that the viral shedding duration was significantly longer in

288

presymptomatic COVID-19 patients than in asymptomatic carrier (Table 1). Lower

289

viral load and shorter viral shedding duration in asymptomatic carriers should be

290

unlikely caused by the neutralizing antibody, because the antibody, either IgM or IgG,

291

was declining more rapidly in asymptomatic carriers than in COVID-19 patients.

292

Innate immunity and cell-mediated immunity should play key roles in repressing viral

293

replication in asymptomatic carriers [28]. Lower viral load and shorter viral shedding

294

time should be due to a relative stronger antiviral immunity, as a high viral load often

295

predisposes adverse outcomes of COVID-19 [9, 29]. To develop effective vaccine

296

against SARS-CoV-2, it is important to arouse the specific cell immunity, instead of

297

focusing on humoral immunity.

In this study, we found that viral load increased from presymptomatic to symptomatic

300

COVID-19 patients (Table 1), indicating that infectivity should be the highest at the

301

stage of disease onset. Asymptomatic carriers had a lower level of viral load and

302

shorter viral shedding duration, indicating that the transmissibility of asymptomatic

303

carriers was relative weaker. In the 4 familial clusters, we found that asymptomatic

304

carriers were mostly children and young adults, mild patients were young and

305

middle-aged adults between 18 and 60 years, and severe cases were older than 60

306

years with underlying diseases. Family members were exposed to the same source of

307

infection. However, they had diverse clinical manifestations: children were often

308

asymptomatic whereas old members were very sick. This observation is quite in

309

consistent with the findings of large epidemiological studies that children acquire

310

SARS-CoV-2 infection mostly have mild respiratory symptoms or are asymptomatic,

311

whereas elderly patients with COVID-19, especially male patients, are more likely to

312

progress into severe-type and even die of this disease [30-33]. Thus, the host

313

immunity and underlying inflammation, which is often affected by ageing, underlying

314

diseases, and dysregulated macrophage response [35], should be the major

315

determinants of disease severity of COVID-19. Although asymptomatic carriers often

316

acquire the infection from family members, they can transmit SARS-CoV-2 into

317

family members and hospital centers, and eventually kill aged members. As a

318

considerable percentage of SARS-CoV-2 infections may be asymptomatic or

319

presymptomatic, enhanced testing approaches may be needed to detect those who

320

transmit the virus.

322

Our study has some limitations. First, follow-up should be extended to observe the

323

duration of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. Second, sample size of asymptomatic

324

carriers with SARS-CoV-2 infected was relatively small.

325

326

Conclusions

327

328

Asymptomatic carriers have a higher level of antiviral immunity and lower level of

329

inflammation to clear SARS-CoV-2, resulting in a lower capacity of SARS-CoV-2

330

transmission, than do symptomatic COVID-19 patients. This antiviral immunity

331

should not be contributable to humoral immunity because both IgM and IgG against

332

SARS-CoV-2 are declining more rapidly in asymptomatic carriers than in COVID-19

333

patients. The severity of COVID-19 is associated with older age and underlying

334

diseases in familial clustering cases. Our data also suggest that boosting vaccination

335

with SARS-CoV-2 should be important. This study may help not only in elucidating

336

the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 interacts with host immunity in determining

337

the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection, but also in optimizing the strategy for the

338

worldwide prophylactic action to develop SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.
