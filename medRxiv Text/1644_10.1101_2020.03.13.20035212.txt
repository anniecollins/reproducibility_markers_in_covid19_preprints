ABSTRACT
In the end of 2019, the epidemic of a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) occurred
in Wuhan and spread rapidly. Changsha, a city located south to the epicenter,
was soon impacted. To control the transmission of the coronavirus and avoid
nosocomial infection, triage procedures based on epidemiology were
implemented in a local hospital of the city. This retrospective study analyzed
the data collected during the triage period and found that COVID-19 patients
were enriched seven folds into the Section A designated for rapid detection and
quarantine. On the other side, roughly triple amounts of visits were received at
the Section B for patients without obvious epidemiological history. Eight COVID19 cases were spotted out of 247 suspected patients. More than 50% of the
suspected patients were submitted to multiple rounds of nucleic acid analysis
for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of the 239 patients who were diagnosed as negative
of the virus infection,188 were successfully revisited and none was reported as
a COVID-19 case. Of the eight COVID-19 patients, three were confirmed only
after multiple rounds of nucleic acid analysis. Besides comorbidities, delayed
sharing of epidemiological history added another layer of complexity to the
diagnosis in practice. While SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is being alerted in many
countries, our report will be helpful to other colleagues in rapid identification of
COVID-19 cases and controlling the transmission of the disease.

INTRODUCTION
The current epidemic of Coronavirus Diseases 2019 (COVID-19) associated
with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) occurred in
Wuhan (Hubei province) in December 2019 and rapidly spread to other areas
in China and more than 100 other countries.1-4 According to the World Health
Organization (WHO), as of March 1, 2020, the cumulative confirmed cases of
COVID-19 in China have reached 79 968 with 2873 deaths (fatality rate 3.6%).5
More than 60% of the confirmed cases were reported from Wuhan.6 Besides
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is the third coronavirus species from
the genus Betacoronavirus that leads to major epidemics in 21st century.3 To
prevent the disease transmission, China has suspended all public transport in
and out of Wuhan since January 23, 2020.7

Changsha, a city located 350 kilometers south of the epicenter, reported its first
imported COVID-19 case on January 21 and the highest level of public health
emergency response was declared two days later.8 The common symptoms of
COVID-19 patients at illness onset include fever, cough, expectoration,
headache, myalgia or fatigue, diarrhoea and haemoptysis.1,9,10 Some of these
symptoms resemble much like other diseases including flu, which has high
occurrence in winter. To avoid the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within hospital,
triage procedures for patients were implemented between January 28 and
February 20 in a local hospital (Xiangya Hospital) of Changsha to facilitate the

rapid detection and quarantine of COVID-19 patients. Here we describe the
clinical practice of triaging patients in the epidemic of SARS-CoV-2, along with
the clinical and laboratory characteristics of eight COVID-19 cases identified
from more than 240 suspected individuals with various symptoms triaged to the
section for patients without obvious epidemiological history.

METHODS
Triage and patients
This single-centre, retrospective, observational study was done at Xiangya
Hospital (Changsha, China). Patients with fever, respiratory symptoms, myalgia,
fatigue, or other symptoms possibly related to SARS-CoV-2 infection were
received at the triage reception between January 28 and February 20 before
being directed to the Section A or B based on epidemiological characteristics.11
Patients, who met one of the following conditions within 14 days before illness
onset, were sorted to the Section A: (a) exposure to Hubei province or local
communities with confirmed COVID-19 cases reported; (b) exposure to patients
with similar symptoms from regions mentioned in (a); (c) exposure to known
COVID-19 patients; (d) association with clustering occurrence (Figure 1A).
Other patients were directed to the Section B.

Besides symptoms, clinical and laboratory characteristics suggestive for SARSCoV-2 infection are: (i) chest computed tomographic (CT) results with

pneumonia features; (ii) normal or reduced leucocyte count or reduced
lymphocyte count in early onset.1,9,12,13 At the Section A, patients having mild
symptoms without both (i) and (ii) were recommended for home quarantine with
prescription. Others were quarantined to take oropharyngeal swab (if not
specified otherwise) for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid analysis by real-time reverse
transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). At the Section B, patients
with suspected chest CT characteristics (i) were also quarantined for nucleic
acid analysis. Others were further evaluated by doctor based on symptoms
(fever, respiratory symptoms, myalgia/fatigue, etc.), comorbidities, vital signs
and blood routine characteristics: patients with severe symptoms were
quarantined for treatment and nucleic acid analysis and were transferred to
relevant units for further treatment when diagnosed as negative for SARS-CoV2 infection; patients having mild symptoms without (ii) were recommended for
home quarantine with prescription, and the rest were submitted for nucleic acid
analysis and were recommended for home quarantine with prescription if
negative result of SARS-CoV-2 was obtained (the second nucleic acid test after
24 hours was recommended and performed based on patient’s availability)
(Figure 1A). Self-quarantined patients were followed up by phone visiting.
Identified COVID-19 patients were immediately transferred to designated
hospitals for quarantine and treatment. All medical personnel working at both
sections and the triage reception were equipped with appropriate protections.14
Suspected patients submitted for nucleic acid analysis at the Section B were

enrolled in this study. The Ethics Commission of Xiangya Hospital approved
this study (No. 202003031). Written informed consent was waived due to the
rapid emergence of this infectious disease.

Data collection
Blood routine, biochemical, radiological and microbiological data together with
demographics, epidemiological characteristics, medical histories and vital signs
(body temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, blood oxygen
saturation) of patients were collected from a local server. If data were missing
from the records or clarification was needed, data were obtained by direct
communication with patients, attending doctors, or other healthcare providers.
All data were checked by two physicians (W. Wang and G. Huang). Patients
with negative results of RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 infection were revisited by
phone when applicable.

Laboratory test
Clinical specimens for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test were obtained in
accordance with clinical guidelines.15 Oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal
swabs were collected with synthetic fiber swabs, maintained in 2-3 mL viraltransport medium and stored between 2 °C and 8 °C until ready for test. RNA
was extracted following the manufacture instruction (SANSURE). Laboratory
confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 was performed using real-time RT-PCR kit

following the manufacture instruction (SANSURE) on the ABI Q5 PCR machine.
Analysis for influenza A/B virus was performed using antigen detection reagent
(colloidal gold method). Routine bacterial examinations were also performed.

RESULTS
In total, 1125 patients (visiting number) were received at the triage reception
(January 28–February 20). Following the triage procedures, 305 visits were
directed to the Section A, and 22 COVID-19 cases (7%, 22/305) were confirmed.
In the first ten days of triage, confirmed cases were identified nearly every day
(Figure 1B). On the other side, 820 visits were directed to the Section B, and
eight cases (1%, 8/820) were confirmed (Table S1). Seven of them were
spotted in the first ten days (Figure 1B). The implemented triage procedures
effectively enriched COVID-19 patients into the Section A and reduced the
possibility of transmitting the virus to other patients and medical stuff. During
the triaging period, the number of reported COVID-19 patients in Changsha
rapidly increased ten times (from 24 to 242) and reached plateau after February
14 (Figure 1B).

Of the 820 visits in the Section B, 239 individual patients were suspected, but
laboratory evidence did not support for SARS-CoV-2 infection. 52% (124/239)
of them did multiple rounds of nucleic acid test. 188 of 223 patients with contact
information were successfully followed up by phone visiting a few days after the

last nucleic acid test. None was reported as a COVID-19 case. 89% (167/188)
of the patients were phone visited more than a week after their last nucleic acid
test (Figure 2). 7% (13/188) of them were double checked by additional medical
institutions.

Of the eight COVID-19 patients identified by the Section B, five (cases 1–5)
were confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection after one round of nucleic acid
analysis (Figure 3 and Table S2). Cases 1 and 2 had no obvious
epidemiological history. Cases 3, 4 and 5 (a familial cluster) arrived at the
Section B initially without revealing both the contact history with people from
Wuhan on a family event as well as the common symptoms among themselves.
They were quarantined after the critical epidemiological information was given
to the doctor during diagnostic inquiry and were soon confirmed to be positive
for SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure 3). Case 6 was evaluated as suspected
COVID-19 case after arriving at the Section B (according to the chest CT
images provided by another hospital) and was quarantined for further diagnosis.
Nucleic acid analysis was performed on the first and the third day during
quarantine. The second analysis supported for the virus infection (Figure 3).

Case 7 arrived from Wuhan on January 22 and was admitted into the hospital
in quarantine with cough, high fever and lymphopenia on January 23 before the
triaging period (Figure 3, Table S3). The chest CT progress with the ground

glass shadow was consistent with the early imaging manifestation of viral
pneumonia (Figure S1). Multiple rounds of nucleic acid analysis (at least 24
hours apart) before and after being transferred to the Section B failed to detect
SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure 3). The clinical features of the patient aggravated
(Table S3). Subsequently, sputum of the patient was induced by 3% hypertonic
saline nebulization and collected for RT-PCR analysis and the virus infection
was confirmed (Figure 3). Of note, sputum-promoting operation was not
routinely performed, as the effect of aerosol transmission of the virus indoor is
of concern.

Before the epidemic alert, case 8 was admitted into the gastroenterology
department due to retching for three weeks. During hospitalization (January 15–
22), other symptoms (shortness of breath, chest tightness), which were
concealed before by retching, were revealed to the medical staff. He was
diagnosed with polyserous effusions, constrictive pericarditis and lung infection
and was discharged because of the alleviation of the above symptoms (Figure
3). Before triage, he visited the emergency department due to coughing. The
number of leucocytes and lymphocytes was in normal range (Table 1). The
chest CT images on January 26 showed bilateral pleural effusion and
pericardial effusion (Figure 4A). On February 3, he was admitted to the ICU due
to severe coughing and dyspnea with normal blood cell count, no recent
suspicious epidemiological history, nor typical chest CT images of viral infection

(Figure 4B, Table 1). Four days later, the chest CT images significantly changed
and indicated possible viral infection. He was directed to the Section B (Figure
4C). However, the results from double nucleic acid analyses did not support for
SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure 3). Meanwhile, the symptoms (e.g. dyspnoea,
chest tightness) were relieved with supportive treatments. However, the
patient’s condition aggravated soon and he was sent into the emergency room.
Since the chest CT images still indicated possible viral infection, multiple rounds
of nucleic acid analysis were performed and confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection
(Figures 3 and 4D). Of note, both oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs
were collected for nucleic acid analysis, but only the latter returned a positive
result for SARS-CoV-2.

DISCUSSION
Our retrospective study describes the clinical practice of triaging patients based
on epidemiology in a local hospital of Changsha during the COVID-19 outbreak.
The triage procedures last for 24 days covering the rapid spreading phase of
SARS-CoV-2 in the city. Comparing to the situation of the Section B, patients
with the virus infection were concentrated seven folds into the Section A, which
was designated for rapid screening and quarantine. The first 10 days were
shown to be critical in reducing the chance of spreading SARS-CoV-2. More
than 85% of COVID-19 patients were identified during this period.

Rapid identification and isolation of COVID-19 patients was key to control the
nosocomial infection, yet the pressure on Section B was still high. The virulence
of SARS-CoV-2 seems to be weaker than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, but the
ability of transmission among humans is stronger.16 During the 24 days of triage,
roughly triple amounts of visits were received at the Section B as compared to
the Section A. 247 individuals were suspected and received careful
examination. More than 50% of them did multiple rounds of nucleic acid
analysis at least 24 hours apart for signs of SARS-CoV-2. Eventually, eight
COVID-19 cases were confirmed. Revisiting the patients diagnosed as
negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection did not reveal that any COVID-19 patient
was missed. Besides different course and severity of illness, delayed sharing
of epidemiological history adds another layer of complexity to the diagnosis,
underlining thorough diagnostic inquiry.

Most COVID-19 patients were identified as positive with one or two rounds of
nucleic acid analysis in our study. Two cases (cases 7 and 8) seemed to be
more complicated than usual. Case 7 arrived at the Section B with two negative
nucleic acid reports already. The course of chest CT images, haematological
features as well as previous Wuhan experience prompted three more rounds of
nucleic acid analysis and finally confirmed the SARS-CoV-2 infection using the
lower respiratory tract specimen. Case 8 had been enrolled into the hospital
multiple times starting before the epidemic was alerted. Though being

thoroughly examined, his comorbidities, no obvious recent epidemic history as
well as the initial two negative results of nucleic acid analysis interfered the
diagnosis. Accordingly, he was not in quarantine for treatment for roughly six
days in the triage period. We only learned during the retrospective study that
more than 200 people had returned to his town from Hubei province before
January 25. Although this piece of information could not serve as concrete
evidence for anything, it would have promoted the doctor to have second
thoughts when looking at his case. After being finally confirmed as a COVID-19
case, overlapping patients along his track in the gastroenterology department
and in the ICU were revisited. More than ten patients regarded as close
contacts in the emergency department were quarantined for observation and
diagnosis. Relevant medical stuff was submitted to CT/nucleic acid analysis.
No one was found to be infected by SARS-CoV-2. Several additional measures
were believed to contribute to this outcome: all patients were persuaded to
actively wear masks during treatment in hospital area; disinfection of the
hospital environment and medical stuff was implemented at least twice more
frequently than usual during this period.

So far, no specific medication is available to cure COVID-19. Current clinical
treatment is mainly supportive.12 The globalization of economy has facilitated
the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from one single city to six continents within
very short time. When the daily reported new COVID-19 cases have been

decreasing in China, they are continuously increasing in many other countries.
On March 11, the WHO has characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic.4 The
worldwide shortage of personal protective equipment has also been alerted.
Triage — a medical practice that can be traced back to Napoleon’s time — has
been integrated into daily practice in modern medical system.17 Yet, most
clinicians, if not all, have no direct experience in the context of fighting a novel
viral epidemic emergency. Our retrospective study of the triaging practice
together with the diagnostic and clinical course of eight COVID-19 patients from
247 suspects will help other colleagues to control the transmission of the virus
in the current COVID-19 outbreak.

FIGURE LEGENDS
Figure 1. The triaging process in the local hospital. (A) The flowchart of
triaging procedure. In total, 1125 visits were triaged to the Section A (305 visits)
and B (820 visits). Suspected patients based on epidemiological history and
CT/BR were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 infection by real-time RT-PCR. 22 and
8 COVID-19 patients were identified in the Section A and B, respectively. The
inset represents the epidemiological characteristics for triaging. See text for
more details. BR: blood routine. (B) The epidemic situation of COVID-19 in
Changsha. Confirmed and discharged cases of COVID-19 in Changsha are
plotted in red and blue, respectively (left axis). The triaging period (January 28–
February 20) is shaded. Cumulative visits to the Section A and B (right axis) are
plotted in black circle and triangle, respectively (days with COVID-19 patients
confirmed are marked in red and green with the number of patients indicated).

Figure 2. Follow-up of 188 patients excluded for SARS-CoV-2 infection by
the Section B. The number of patients visited by phone (bar, left axis) and the
average number of RT-PCR analysis per patient (black line, right axis) is plotted
against the time interval between the phone visiting and the last RT-PCR
analysis performed in the Section B. No patient was found to be a COVID-19
case after the last diagnosis in the Section B as negative for SARS-CoV-2
infection.

Figure 3. Timeline of illness onset and medical experience of the eight
COVID-19 patients. Dates with possible exposure history to SARS-CoV-2 are
marked in yellow and quarantine dates in pink. Real-time RT-PCR positive or
negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection is represented by red or white star,
respectively. Influenza A/B virus was not detected. The asterisks mark the dates
of CT images shown in Figure S1 (for case 7) and Figure 4 (for case 8). Cities
A and B are not in Hubei province.

Figure 4. The course of chest CT images of case 8. (A) Images from January
26 show bilateral pleural effusion and pericardial effusion. (B) Images from
February 3 show bilateral pleural effusion and pericardial effusion with a small
area of ground-glass opacity in the left upper lung. (C) Images from February 7
show increased ground-glass opacity of the left upper lung with bilateral pleural
effusion. A small area of new ground-glass opacity appeared in the right lung.
(D) Images from February 11 show the further enlarged ground-glass opacity
of the left upper lung. New ground-glass opacity is visible in the rest areas of
lungs. The left pleural effusion decreased, and the right pleural effusion
increased.
