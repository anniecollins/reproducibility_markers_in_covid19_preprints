Abstract
Direct RNA sequencing using an Oxford Nanopore MinION characterised the
transcriptome of SARS-CoV-2 grown in Vero E6 cells. This cell line is being widely
used to propagate the novel coronavirus. The viral transcriptome was analysed using
a recently developed ORF-centric pipeline. This revealed the pattern of viral
transcripts, (i.e. subgenomic mRNAs), generally fitted the predicted replication and
transcription model for coronaviruses. A 24 nt in-frame deletion was detected in
subgenomic mRNAs encoding the spike (S) glycoprotein. This feature was identified
in over half of the mapped transcripts and was predicted to remove a proposed furin
cleavage site from the S glycoprotein. This motif directs cleavage of the S glycoprotein
into functional subunits during virus entry or exit. Cleavage of the S glycoprotein can
be a barrier to zoonotic coronavirus transmission and affect viral pathogenicity. Allied
to this transcriptome analysis, tandem mass spectrometry was used to identify over
500 viral peptides and 44 phosphopeptides, covering almost all of the proteins
predicted to be encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 genome, including peptides unique to
the deleted variant of the S glycoprotein. Detection of an apparently viable deletion in
the furin cleavage site of the S glycoprotein reinforces the point that this and other
regions of SARS-CoV-2 proteins may readily mutate. This is of clear significance given
the interest in the S glycoprotein as a potential vaccine target and the observation that
the furin cleavage site likely contributes strongly to the pathogenesis and zoonosis of
this virus. The viral genome sequence should be carefully monitored during the growth
of viral stocks for research, animal challenge models and, potentially, in clinical
samples. Such variations may result in different levels of virulence, morbidity and
mortality.

Introduction
Since the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARSCoV-2) as a human pathogen at the end of 2019, the virus has spread globally,
causing > 312 000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 13,400 deaths as of the 22nd
March, 20201. Although vaccines are under rapid development to prevent SARS-CoV2 infection, little is known of either the immune correlates of protection or the ability of
the virus to avoid the host immune response through mutation and recombination2.

The genome sequence was rapidly determined and revealed that SARS-CoV-2 is
most closely related to bat coronavirus RaTG13 and clusters with SARS-CoV, that
emerged in 2002, in the genus Betacoronavirus of the family Coronaviridae3,4. Based
on homology to other known coronaviruses3,4, the genome sequence was used for
viral transcript prediction and the annotation of ORFs. Coronaviruses use a complex
strategy to express their genetic information5, and transcription is initiated from defined
(and sometimes cryptic) transcription associated sequences6. Similar, to other
coronaviruses, the SARS-CoV-2 29.9 kB RNA genome contains two large ORFs,
ORF1a and ORF1ab, predicted to be initially translated into the polyproteins, pp1a,
and pp1ab that arises by ribosomal frameshifting (Figure 1A). The polyproteins are
post-translationally processed by viral encoded proteases to produce 16 proteins that
are conserved between coronaviruses and proposed to function in the synthesis of
viral RNA and immune evasion7. During viral genome replication a set of “nested”
subgenomic mRNAs are produced that are predicted to encode the structural proteins
spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) and at least nine small
accessory proteins, some of which are unique to SARS-CoV-23,4. The subgenomic

mRNAs have a common 5’ leader sequence and are 3’ co-terminal with a polyA tail.
This feature is likely to be added by viral encoded proteins in the cytoplasm of an
infected cell.

Recently, the SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome has been examined using direct RNAseq
(dRNAseq)8,9. Furthermore, a recent proteomic study showed that a number of the
predicted viral proteins are produced in infected cells, but not all of the predicted viral
proteins were detected10. We pioneered the use of combining transcriptomics and
proteomics to study viral infections in vitro and in vivo, initially using the well
characterised respiratory virus, adenovirus but also respiratory syncytial virus and
highly pathogenic zoonotic viruses such as Hendra virus11-13. More recently we have
focussed on the latest technologies to study the transcriptome of viruses, including
direct RNA sequencing on nanopore devices using long read length sequencing. In
particular, we developed a novel ORF-centric pipeline to analyse the very large
amounts of transcriptomic data generated by this technique14. This pipeline was first
used on data generated from adenovirus infected cells. The approach rapidly
reproduced transcript maps that correlated highly with the previously described
transcriptome maps of adenovirus which have been carefully curated over several
decades.

The SARS-CoV-2 subgenomic mRNAs encoding the structural proteins and their
expression profiles are of particular interest as the encoded proteins are likely targets
of a protective immune response. The coronavirus S glycoprotein is present as a
homotrimer, protruding from the surface of the virion. It is a key determinant of viral
tropism and the major antigenic target15,16. The S glycoprotein is a class I fusion

protein comprised of two domains, S1 and S2, responsible for receptor binding and
the fusion of viral and cellular membranes respectively17,18. The coronavirus S
glycoprotein of coronaviruses is primed for cell entry by host cell proteases that cleave
the protein at one or more positions. Cleavage of a “S1/S2” site at the boundary of the
S1 and S2 domains occurs for some coronaviruses whilst cleavage at a “S2” site is
common to all coronaviruses and results in activation of a highly conserved fusion
peptide immediately downstream of the S2 site19-21. Although the SARS-CoV-2 S
glycoprotein shares 97% identity with that of bat coronavirus RaTG1322, an important
difference is the presence of a four amino acid insertion (681PRRA684) at the S1/S2
cleavage site that introduces a potential furin-like cleavage site23,24. The furin cleavage
site is also not found in other “lineage B” betacoronaviruses including SARS-CoV, but
has been detected in betacoronaviruses in other lineages, suggesting that this region
has arisen during natural evolution25.

Here we used a combined transcriptomics and proteomics approach to produce a
correlated transcriptome and proteome map of SARS-CoV-2 in the African Green
monkey kidney cell line Vero E6. This cell line is routinely used globally to propagate
viruses from clinical samples as well as to generate stocks of virus for academic
research, drug susceptibility testing and vaccine challenge studies. There was a close
correlation between predicted viral transcriptome and proteome maps as well as novel
transcripts that encoded for proteins detected by tandem mass spectrometry. Finally,
evidence was gathered for an in-frame deletion inside the S glycoprotein that removed
the proposed furin cleavage site.

Results.
Complete characterisation of a novel and dangerous pathogen at a molecular level is
highly desirable. Although analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 genome enables high
confidence prediction of potential transcripts and ORFS, there is a pressing need to
have the predictions confirmed and novel transcripts identified and assessed for
biological significance and role in virulence and pathogenesis. At the same time,
independent confirmation that viral transcripts were expressed was achieved by
tandem mass spectrometry-based proteomics. This provided direct observation of the
whole range of viral proteins and helped resolve ambiguities in the transcriptomic data.
Finally, identification of phosphorylation sites provided an invaluable list of therapeutic
targets based on kinase inhibitors. Using proteomics informed by transcriptomics (PIT)
11

on duplicate infected cells offered a rapid and high resolution approach to these key

molecular virology questions.

Overview of dRNAseq outputs
Long read length sequencing using an Oxford Nanopore MinION on polyA+ RNA from
cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 was used to characterise viral RNA species. This
technique has recently been used to study herpes viruses, coronaviruses and
adenovirus transcriptomes 14,26,27. In total, 1,588,330 sequences were base called and
passed QC, of those 527,401 were mapped to the BetaCoV/England/02/2020 genome
using minimap2 (Figure 1b). In addition, an average polyA tail length for each
transcript was generated using nanopolish and this information was added to the
analysis pipeline. A strict cut off of a 20 nt minimum polyA length was employed and
386,903 transcripts passed this test. Accurately determining the 5’ end of direct

RNAseq transcripts has been shown to be problematic 14,27,28. The accepted model for
coronavirus transcription (Figure 1a) proposes that all viral mRNAs have a common
5’ end

29

and the analysis herein was further restricted to those transcripts that met

this criterion which reduced the total number of identified full length subgenomic
mRNA molecules to 72,124. Figure 1c illustrates a transcription map of those
transcripts that start at the expected location and have a known ORF as the 5’ most
ORF. Transcripts that could express all of the predicted ORFs were present, including
for the newly predicted ORF10

30

. However, only one transcript was detected and as

previously suggested 8,9 the status of this as a genuine transcript needs careful further
investigation. Moreover, non-canonical TRS joining events were detected leading to,
for example, apparently bone fide subgenomic transcripts coding for ORF7b. this was
also recently reported by Kim et al. 8. The distribution of transcripts with a 5’ UTR
consistent with the model of coronavirus mRNA expression that would also code for a
predicted protein are shown in Table 1. Also reported are the average polyA tail
lengths of each transcript group. These appeared to be shorter than most human
eukaryotic transcripts but is consistent with recently reported findings for SARS-CoV2 8. Finally, the data from the analysis pipeline was tabulated and describes the
structure of transcripts, how often they were observed, what features were present on
each transcript and where the dominant transcription start sites and junctions are
(Supplementary Tables 1- 4).

Novel deletion in the S glycoprotein.
Manual inspection of the transcripts aligned to the virus genome revealed a large
number of reads that aligned to the gene encoding the S glycoprotein with a 24 nt
deletion. This was predicted to result in a deletion of 9 aa, encompassing the proposed

furin-like cleavage site (Figure 2a) with the replacement of a single isoleucine residue.
Indeed the analysis revealed that there were a large number of transcripts that had
both a polyA tail > 20 nt and a start at the proposed transcription start location, more
than the full length S-glycoprotein (Table 1). To confirm this finding and examine if the
deletion was present in the original stock samples at the PHE reference laboratory,
the region was PCR amplified from the virus passaged at Bristol or from the original
stock. These amplified fragments were sequenced using the Sanger method. This
revealed that the Bristol stock was indeed a mixture of genomes but the original stock
was solely wild type sequence. Subsequent examination of a very high quality dataset

did not detect any evidence of similar significant

deletions in the S glycoprotein in their data. However, their dataset contained a
spontaneous deletion within the region of the genome coding for the E protein resulting
in a 9aa in-frame deletion in almost two thirds of the mapped transcripts
(Supplementary Figure 1).

Proteomic detection of known SARS-CoV-2 proteins.
Tandem mass spectrometry was utilised to detect as many viral peptides and
phosphopeptides as possible (Supplementary dataset 5). Table 2 illustrates the
numbers of peptides found for each of the predicted ORFs. Notably, whilst most of the
ORFs detected were also confirmed in the recent report by Bojkova et al.

10

, there

were some differences. Whilst we could not detect peptides from ORF9b as described
by Bojkova et al., peptides corresponding to the ORF9a protein were identified. This
leaves only E, ORF7b and ORF10 to be detected by mass spectrometry. In addition,
peptides unique to proteolytically processed components of the viral replicase
polyprotein pp1ab; namely nsp4, nsp9, nsp12, nsp13, nsp14 and nsp15 were

identified indicating that these important processing steps occurred as predicted
(Table 3).

Initially no unique peptides corresponding to the novel deleted version of the Sglycoprotein were detected by tandem mass spectrometry. However, a typical tryptic
digest protocol would generate very large potentially undetectable peptides.
Accordingly, samples were digested using chymotrypsin and the analysis repeated
revealing a single peptide corresponding to the deleted version of the S-glycoprotein,
but only when using a 5% false discovery threshold. However, this provided sufficient
information to enable a targeted search. This identified nine Peptide Spectral Match’s
(PSMs) with high confidence (i.e. FDR 1%) that corroborated the expression of the
deleted spike protein (Supplementary dataset 6).

Proteomic detection of previously unknown viral proteins.
Transcriptomics and proteomics can be combined to provide unbiased insight into the
proteome of viruses and higher eukaryotes 11,12,31. The ORF centric pipeline was used
to generate a list of possible ORFs which could be made by translating the first ORF
present on every transcript sequenced. As before

14

, to overcome the inherent error

prone nature of nanopore sequencing, the transcript was mapped to the viral genome
and used the mapping information to create pseudo-transcripts based on the
sequence of the viral genome.

Using this list of predicted proteins revealed a large number of novel peptides arising
which could not be explained by the standard list of predicted viral proteins. In the
majority of cases they appeared to be transcripts with rare and unusual structures

likely resulting from rare rearrangements of the viral genome or potentially during
subgenomic mRNA synthesis. However, in some cases a large number of similar
transcripts were supported by direct peptide evidence that these rearrangements are
indeed translated. In particular multiple versions of the N protein with distinct small
internal deletions were detected for which 20 transcripts that could encode for these
proteins were also identified (Supplementary dataset 7). A schematic of such a
deletion in the N protein is shown, indicating the peptide that was identified by tandem
mass spectrometry to support the observed transcripts (Figure 2c).

Phophoproteomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 proteins.
Allied to an analysis of viral peptides, the phosphorylation status of viral proteins was
investigated as this could reveal potential targets for licenced kinase inhibitors.
Phosphopeptides corresponding to locations on the N, M, ORF 3a, nsp3, nsp9, nsp12
and S-glycoprotein were detected (Table 4). The presence of phosphorylation sites on
the S glycoprotein has not been previously noted and may be of significance in terms
of vaccines based on this protein, the location of these sites is illustrated (Figure 3).
The location of the phosphorlaytion sites on the proteins listed is illustrated in Figure
4 and additional models of the phosphorylation sites on the N-terminal RNA binding
domain of the N protein are shown in Figure 5.

Discussion.
This integrated analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome and proteome revealed
significant findings, in particular, the identification of an eight aa deletion in the SARSCoV-2 S glycoprotein that potentially effects protein cleavage, cell tropism and
infectivity. The coronavirus S glycoprotein is made as a larger precursor that must be
primed by cleavage using host cell proteases to enable subsequent viral entry. For
different coronaviruses, cleavage can occur at one or more sites (termed the S1/S2
and S2´ sites) depending on the amino acid consensus sequences present at each
site and has major repercussions on host cell tropism and pathogenesis 19. The SARSCoV S glycoprotein has a single arginine residue at the S1/S2 site (Figure 2b), that
facilitates cleavage by a number of proteases including trypsin, cathepsin L and
TMPRSS11D

32-34

and a consensus sequence for trypsin and/or elastin cleavage at

the S2´ site35,36. By comparison, SARS-CoV-2 has a four amino acid insertion
(680SPRR683) in the S glycoprotein that results in the generation of a furin-like cleavage
site (682RRAR685) at the S1/S2 boundary that is not present in other lineage B
betacoronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and the highly related bat coronavirus
RaTG1323. Moreover, analysis of a cryo-EM structure of the S glycoprotein showed
that the SPRR insertion creates a disordered solvent exposed loop24 that protrudes
from the trimer surface (Figure 3a). It has been proposed that this region is more
available to host cell proteases for processing24. The presence of a furin-like cleavage
site at the S1/S2 boundary results in cleavage of the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein
before viral exit from the cell, whereas the S glycoprotein of coronaviruses such as
SARS-CoV, lacking a S1/S2 furin cleavage site, exit the cells with the S glycoprotein
largely uncleaved, necessitating cleavage prior to or during cell entry20,37,38.

The SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein deletion identified in this study removes the furin
cleavage site, but also Arg685 (corresponding to SARS-CoV Arg667) required for
cleavage of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein. However the sequence

694AY/T696

(numbering of undeleted S glycoprotein, cleavage shown by “/”; Figure 2b) is still
retained and has been identified as a second potential S1/S2 protease cleavage site
for SARS-CoV downstream of the basic Arg667 residue23 suggesting that either the
deleted SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein could be cleaved at this site or only use the S2´
site for cleavage. Recently pseudoviruses expressing the SARS-CoV-2 S-glycoprotein
and the corresponding S glycoprotein with the furin cleavage site removed at the
S1/S2 boundary (residues

680SPRR683

removed) were made and their ability to

mediate entry to Vero E6 and BHK-21 cells expressing hACE2 compared33. Deletion
of the furin cleavage site enhanced the entry of the corresponding pseudovirus into
Vero E6 cells but diminished entry into hACE2 BHK-21 cells. Although the engineered
deletion differed from the naturally occurring deletion described here, this observation
suggests that the naturally occurring deletion (in cell culture) enhances the ability of
the virus to enter Vero cells and was selected for during passage in Vero cells. This
has clear implications for the use of Vero cells to propagate and grow large batches
of the virus for research and especially virus batches grown for use in vaccine
challenge studies. Moreover, it also raises the possibility that even virus stocks which
have been carefully assayed for homogeneity could still spontaneously generate this
deletion during animal challenge studies – particularly in non-human primates and
perhaps especially in animals from the Chlorocebus genus. Thus, vaccine studies will
need to carefully monitor the homogeneity of the challenge virus throughout the study
period. In principle viruses carrying the Bristol deletion in the S glycoprotein may well
be attenuated in vivo in NHPs. The early emergence of a viral population carrying the

Bristol deletion within an individual challenge animal would give the false impression
that an individual animal had a mild infection. Given that animal studies are required
to use the smallest number of animals needed for statistical significance just one event
like this could confound the study. Allied to this is the question of how such a deletion
may affect therapeutic assessment of monoclonal antibodies directed against the
virus. We have already instigated a programme to determine if this deletion also
occurs in human clinical isolates and are currently examining the evolution of the S
glycoprotein deletant virus in human cell lines to determine whether the furin cleavage
site is essential for infection of human cells.

In addition to the S glycoprotein deletion we were also able to find an additional
significant deletion, in high quality data recently deposited by Kim et al.8, in the region
of the E protein. This finding reinforces the potential of the virus to incur unexpected
spontaneous deletions in viral genes during passaging, that are hard to predict and
detect, something researchers need to be vigilant for. A recent analysis showed that
deletion of ORF8 from human clinical isolates is possible

39

and our data shows that

novel SARS-CoV-2 viruses containing deletions or even insertions can arise naturally
and successfully propagate. As the virus continues to spread and potentially comes
under selective pressure from the host response in humans, vaccines and antiviral
drugs in the future, vigilance will be required to detect novel rearrangements/deletions.
Coronaviruses use a distinctive complex mechanism for genome replication that

Allied to this we observed a rarer but detectable set of deletions throughout the viral
mRNA repertoire with several notable deletions that give rise to uniquely identifiable
peptides. This reinforces the potential for SARS-CoV-2 to naturally undergo
deletions/rearrangements throughout the genome under selective pressure,
something perhaps readily predictable from other coronaviruses but now confirmed
directly in at least one cell line. If the plasticity of the SARS-CoV-2 genome follows the
same pathway as HCoV-NL6340 then different isolates will emerge through
recombination and this may result in repeat infection as protection will not be effective.

The detection of numerous phophorylation sites within critical viral proteins is another
key resource. The phosphorylation of the N protein of multiple coronaviruses is well
known41-45 and the phosphorylation sites identified lie in either the N-terminal RNA
binding domain or interdomain linker46. Mapping of the phosphorylation sites on an xray structure of the SARS-CoV-2 N-terminal RNA binding domain showed they were
surface located (Figure 5). However, we believe this is the first report of
phosphorylation of the coronavirus proteins M, nsp3 and S. These are all membrane
bound proteins. M protein is critical in forming the viral particle, nsp3 is a key
multifunctional component of the replication/transcription machinery and S protein is
the major attachment protein respectively47. The phosphorylation sites identified on
the S glycoprotein may be important in assembly of the trimer. Residues T29, S31,
S349, T791 and S816 are all surface located, whilst T240 sits underneath a disordered
loop which when phosphorylated, will add negative charge which may influence loop
conformation. Residues Y789 and (perhaps to a lesser extent) T791 sit at the subunit
interface and may be involved in controlling trimer assembly. S637 and S640 lie in a

modelled loop but are nevertheless potentially interesting. They are close together in
sequence and in the loops modelled for the compact folds these model well as
hairpins. In the chain with the extended domain, the same loop models in an extended
form. This would be consistent with phosphorylation at S637 and S640 forcing the
hairpin apart. These are worth exploring as potential control points for spike
conformational changes from compact to an extended form. Overall the identification
of protein phosphorylation sites is notable but we believe that the greater utility may
be that identifying numerous phophorylation sites on viral proteins will open the
potential for a rational investigation of clinically licenced kinase inhibitors as antiviral
drugs as has previously been observed for SARS-CoV 48.

Finally, this transcriptomic and proteomic dataset is a rich resource for research teams
building a picture of this novel virus as it enables an accurate overview of the
transcription profile and adds significant new direct observational data for the viral
proteins.

Methods
Virus growth and assay.
Vero E6 (ATCC® CRL 1586™) cells were cultured at 37°C in Dulbecco's modified
Eagle's medium (DMEM, Gibco™, ThemoFisher) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS), penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 µg/ml). All work with
infectious SARS-CoV-2 strain England/2/2020 (VE6-T), isolated by Public Health
England (PHE), was done inside a class III microbiological safety cabinet in a
containment level 3 facility at the University of Bristol. A SARS-CoV-2 stock was
produced by infecting Vero E6 cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 and
incubating the cells for 72 hours. The culture supernatant was clarified by
centrifugation and stored in aliquots at -80°C. The titre of the stock was determined by
preparing 10-fold serial dilutions in Eagle’s minimal essential medium (MEM; Gibco™,
ThemoFisher) supplemented with 2% FBS. Aliquots of each dilution were added to 1
× 104 Vero E6 cells in the same medium in each of 12 wells of a 96-well plate. Plates
were incubated at 37°C for 5-7 days and then examined for cytopathic effect. The
TCID50 was calculated according to the method of Reed and Muench 49.

RNA extraction for direct RNA sequencing.
Extraction and sequencing was done as previously described

14

. Briefly, total RNA

was extracted using TRIzol™ reagent (#15596026, Ambion) and the RNA extracted
as per the manufacturer’s recommendations but with 3 x 70% ethanol washes. After
resuspension in RNAse-free water the RNA was polyA enriched and sequenced
immediately using SQK-RNA002 kits and MIN106D R9 version flow cells (Oxford
Nanopore Technologies).

Data analysis, characterisation of viral transcripts.
To cope with the very wide range of transcripts, and to enable grouping of transcripts
into classes, our previously described ORF centric data analysis pipeline was utilised
14

. The transcripts were mapped to the viral genome with minimap2 and the mapping

data was used to identify transcription regulatory sequences (TRS), the sites where
the transcript meets the poly A tail at the end of the genome and junction sites which
the software refers to as splice acceptor/donor sites as it was originally used to
describe spliced adenovirus transcripts. This script produces tables indicating where
on the genome and how often in the data each junction occurs. Subsequently, nearby
events are grouped together for simplicity of analysis. Once this is complete, the
software then assigns each transcript to a “transcript group” depending on its pattern
of TRS, junction sites and poly A locations and counts how many transcripts belong to
each transcript group. Nanopolish50 was used to determine the polyA length of each
sequenced transcript and subsequently the average polyA length was calculated for
each transcript group.

A second in-house script determined which known features are present in each
transcript group and generated pseudo transcripts based on the viral genome
sequence to remove nanopore sequencing errors. The script examined each pseudotranscript to determine what features it has, using a user-specified list of canonical
features or ORFs on the viral genome (Supplementary Data 8). It also produced GFF
files that allow the user to visualise the dominant transcript coding for each ORF as
well as GFF files describing the whole range of transcripts coding for any given ORF.
In addition, an analysis counting the final number of transcripts belonging to each

translated feature was produced. The pipeline generated an ORF-centric view of the
viral transcriptome – classifying transcripts according to the viral proteins coded for.

RNA extraction for sequencing of the suspected deletion region.
To prepare intracellular SARS-CoV-2 RNA, total cellular RNA containing SARS-CoV2 RNA was extracted from the Vero E6 cells used for viral stock production using
TRIzol™ Reagent (Invitrogen™, ThemoFisher) following the manufacturer’s
instructions. Viral RNA was extracted from cell culture supernatants using a QIAamp
Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Approximately 3 kb RT-PCR products covering the S gene deletion were amplified
from the viral RNA using the gene specific primers F9newF and F9newR (5´TAAGGTTGGTGGTAATTATAATTACCTG-3´

and

5´-

AAAATAGTTGGCATCATAAAGTAATGGG-3´) and a SuperScript™ IV One-Step RTPCR System (Invitrogen™, ThemoFisher). A region spanning the deletion was
sequenced

using

primers

Wu_24_L

and

Wu_24_R

(5´-

TTGAACTTCTACATGCACCAGC-3´ and 5´-CCAGAAGTGATTGTACCCGC-3´).

Total Proteome Analysis
Protein lysates were prepared from the Vero E6 cells used for viral stock production.
The cells were harvested in 4X Laemmli buffer (BioRad) and heated to 95 °C for 15
min. A 25 µl aliquot of the sample was separated using SDS-PAGE and the gel lane
cut into 20 slices. The slices were reduced (10 mM DTT, 56 °C, 30 min), alkylated
(100 mM iodoacetamide, room temperature, 20 min) and digested with trypsin (0.5 µg
trypsin per slice, 37 °C, overnight).

This whole process was repeated with

chymotryptic digestion (0.5 µg chymotrypsin per slice, 25 °C, overnight). The resulting

tryptic and chymotryptic peptides were fractionated using an Ultimate 3000 nano-LC
system in line with an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific).
In brief, the peptides from each gel slice in 1% (vol/vol) formic acid were injected onto
an Acclaim PepMap C18 nano-trap column (Thermo Scientific). After washing with
0.5% (vol/vol) acetonitrile 0.1% (vol/vol) formic acid, peptides were resolved on a 250
mm × 75 μm Acclaim PepMap C18 reverse phase analytical column (Thermo
Scientific) over a 150 min organic gradient, using 7 gradient segments (1-3% solvent
B over 1 min, 3-15% B over 58 min, 15-32%B over 58 min, 32-40%B over 5 min, 4090%B over 1 min, held at 90%B for 6 min and then reduced to 1%B over 1 min) with
a flow rate of 300 nl min−1. Solvent A was 0.1% formic acid and Solvent B was
aqueous 80% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid.

Peptides were ionized by nano-

electrospray ionization at 2.2 kV using a stainless-steel emitter with an internal
diameter of 30 μm (Thermo Scientific) and a capillary temperature of 250 °C.

All spectra were acquired using an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer
controlled by Xcalibur 4.1 software (Thermo Scientific) and operated in datadependent acquisition mode. FTMS1 spectra were collected at a resolution of 120
000 over a scan range (m/z) of 375-1550 (for tryptic peptides) or 325-1500 (for
chymotryptic peptides), with an automatic gain control (AGC) target of 4E5 and a max
injection time of 50ms. Precursors were filtered according to charge state (to include
charge states 2-7), with monoisotopic peak determination set to peptide and using an
intensity threshold of 1E3. Previously interrogated precursors were excluded using a
dynamic window (40s +/-10ppm). The MS2 precursors were isolated with a
quadrupole isolation window of 0.7m/z. ITMS2 spectra were collected with an AGC
target of 2E4, max injection time of 35ms and HCD collision energy of 30 %.

A targeted analysis was performed to confirm the identification of the del-spike peptide
(QTQTIASQSIIA) identified by a single peptide spectral match (PSM) in the initial
analysis of chymotryptic peptides. However, there were changes to the acquisition
workflow. Precursors were filtered according to charge state (to include charge state
2) and previously interrogated precursors were excluded using a dynamic window (2s
+/-10ppm). A targeted mass was specified with m/z 712.3759 and z=2.

Phospho Proteome Analysis
Six 30 µl aliquots of the sample were separated by SDS-PAGE until the dye front had
moved approximately 1cm into the separating gel. Each gel lane was excised as a
single slice and subjected to in-gel tryptic digestion as above but using 1.5 µg trypsin
per slice.

The resulting peptides were subjected to TiO2-based phosphopeptide

enrichment according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Pierce). The flow-through
and washes from the TiO2-based enrichment were then subjected to FeNTA-based
phosphopeptide enrichment, again according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Pierce). The phospho-enriched samples were evaporated to dryness and then
resuspended in 1% formic acid prior to analysis by nano-LC MSMS using an Orbitrap
Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) as above.

Data Analysis
The raw data files were processed using Proteome Discoverer software v2.1 (Thermo
Scientific) and searched against the UniProt Chlorocebus sabaeus database
(downloaded March 2020; 19525 sequences), an in-house ‘common contaminants’
database and a custom SARS-CoV-2 protein database using the SEQUEST HT

algorithm. Peptide precursor mass tolerance was set at 10 ppm, and MS/MS tolerance
was set at 0.6 Da. Search criteria included oxidation of methionine (+15.995 Da),
acetylation of the protein N-terminus (+42.011 Da) and methionine loss plus
acetylation of the protein N-terminus (-89.03 Da) as variable modifications and
carbamidomethylation of cysteine (+57.021Da) as a fixed modification. For the
phospho-proteome analysis, phosphorylation of serine, threonine and tyrosine
(+79.966 Da) was also included as a variable modification. Searches were performed
with full tryptic or chymotryptic digestion and a maximum of 2 missed cleavages were
allowed. The reverse database search option was enabled and all data was filtered
to satisfy a false discovery rate (FDR) of 5%.

Figure 1.
Overview of nanopore inferred transcriptome.
Part a illustrates the classical transcription map of coronaviruses adapted for SARS-CoV-2.
The genome is itself an mRNA which when translated gives rise to polyproteins pp1a and,
upon a ribosomal frameshift, pp1ab. These polyproteins are proteolytically processed down
to a range of non-structural proteins termed nsp1-16 some of which will form the viral
replication-transcription complex (RTC). The RTC then generates subgenomic mRNA which
canonically contains a sequence present at the 5’ end of the viral genome known as the
Transcription Regulating Sequence - Leader (TRS - L) linked by discontinuous transcription to
one of several similar sequences downstream of pp1ab. In this manner the remaining ORFS
on the viral genome are placed 5’ most on the subgenomic mRNA and are subsequently
translated.
Part b shows the total read depth across the viral genome for all reads, the maximum read
depth was 511,129.
Part c illustrates the structure of dominant transcript coding for each of the identified ORFS.
Only transcripts that starts inside the leader TRS sequence are considered here. The black
rectangles represent mapped nucleotides and the arrowed lines represent regions of the
genome that are skipped. To the right is noted the 5’ most ORF is that the transcript would
code for, in parenthesis we note how many individual transcripts were observed.
Figure 2
Deletions within the viral mRNA in the S glycoprotein and N
In (a) is shown the read depth over the region deleted in the S glycoprotein together with
information on the sequence in the region and the translation in all three frames. (b) is a
clustal alignment of three proteins over this region, wild type SARS-CoV, wild type SARSCoV-2, the artificially deleted version of the wild type SARS-Cov_2 S glycoprotein as
reported in Walls et al. and finally the predicted sequence of the deleted protein described
here. Highlighted in yellow is the sequence of the unique peptide generated by
chymotrypsin digest of the protein which was identified by tandem mass spectrometry. (c)
illustrates a similar examination of a proposed deletion in the N protein predicted by
multiple aligned transcripts and subsequently identified in trypsin digested protein samples
as indicated by the unique peptide highlighted in yellow.
Figure 3
A space filled model of the wild type SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein in a trimeric form using the
sequence of a) the native or b) spike deletant virus, in which the aa’s 679NSPRRARSV687 have
been replaced with Ile. The model was built using a cryo-EM structure (6VSB.pdb) of the S
glycoprotein in the prefusion form (25). Each of the monomers is coloured differently. The
loop containing the furin cleavage site (or the shortened loop in the deleted version in b) is
indicated in red. The positions of phosphorylation sites identified by mass spectrometry and
surface located were mapped on the native structure and shown in yellow in a).

Figure 4
Schematic of the location of phosphorylation sites
Proteins M, N, NSP3, NSP9 and S glycoprotein are shown as we have accurate phospho-site
data for these proteins. For each location we indicate the aminos acid (S, T or Y) and the
amino acid numbering. The S glycoprotein is shown as S1 and S2 for ease of display and to
illustrate where the sites would be relative to the major cleavage site on the wild type Gglycoprotein.
Figure 5
Modelling phosphorylation on the RNA binding domain of N protein.
The positions of phosphorylation sites identified by mass spectrometry were mapped on the
x-ray crystal structure of the N-terminal RNA binding domain of the N protein (aa residues
47 – 173) from SARS-CoV-2 (6YVO.pdb). The four monomer units in one asymmetric unit are
distinctly coloured and shown as (a and b) side and (c and d) top views as ribbon (left hand
figures) and space filling models (right hand figures).

Tables
Table 1.
Count of transcripts where the 5’ most ORF is a recognised ORF.
Only transcripts that start to map within the expected leader TRS are considered. For each
transcript group the average polyA length is also shown for the dominant transcript that
codes for the indicated ORF. Note that around 14% of transcripts do not apparently code for
a recognised ORF, noted as “none from list”.
Table 2.
Peptide counts for viral proteins.
For each protein the total number of unique peptides is indicated alongside how many
PSMs support the peptides identified. In the case of the viral polyprotein pp1ab, we also list
how many peptides uniquely mapped to each nsp region.
Table 3
Peptides unique to processed proteins
The polyprotein pp1ab is processed into matured smaller proteins nsp1-16 during infection,
this table indicates which unique peptides were identified that could only arise as a result of
full polyprotein processing.
Table 4
Phosphopeptide counts
Listed for each protein is the number of distinct phosphor sites identified along with the
locations and amino acid modified as well as how many contributing PSMs there are in total.
For proteins ORF3a and nsp12 no distinct site could be identified despite a phosphorylated
peptide being found, in these cases the peptide sequence is provided.
