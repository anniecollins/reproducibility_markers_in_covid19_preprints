Abstract:

18

Background: Zoonotically transmitted coronaviruses are responsible for three disease outbreaks

19

since 2002, including the current COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2. Its efficient

20

transmission and range of disease severity raise questions regarding the contributions of virus-

21

receptor interactions. ACE2 is a host ectopeptidase and the receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Numerous

22

reports describe ACE2 mRNA abundance and tissue distribution; however, mRNA abundance is

23

not always representative of protein levels. Currently, there is limited data evaluating ACE2

24

protein and its correlation with other SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility factors.

25

Materials and methods: We systematically examined the human upper and lower respiratory

26

tract using single-cell RNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry to determine receptor

27

expression and evaluated its association with risk factors for severe COVID-19.

28

Findings: Our results reveal that ACE2 protein is highest within regions of the sinonasal cavity

29

and pulmonary alveoli, sites of presumptive viral transmission and severe disease development,

30

respectively. In the lung parenchyma, ACE2 protein was found on the apical surface of a small

31

subset of alveolar type II cells and colocalized with TMPRSS2, a cofactor for SARS-CoV2

32

entry. ACE2 protein was not increased by pulmonary risk factors for severe COVID-19.

33

Additionally, ACE2 protein was not reduced in children, a demographic with a lower incidence

34

of severe COVID-19.

35

Interpretation: These results offer new insights into ACE2 protein localization in the human

36

respiratory tract and its relationship with susceptibility factors to COVID-19.

Research in context:

42

Evidence before this study: Previous studies of ACE2 mRNA transcript abundance in the human

43

respiratory tract have suggested a possible association between ACE2 expression and age, sex,

44

and the presence of comorbidities. However, these studies have provided conflicting results, as

45

well as a lack of protein validation. Previous ACE2 protein studies have been limited by a

46

paucity of lung tissue samples and reports that have produced contradictory results.

47
48

Added value of this study: Using a combination of single-cell RNA sequencing and

49

immunohistochemistry, we describe ACE2 expression in the human respiratory tract. Staining

50

protocols were optimized and validated to show consistent apical localization and avoid non-

51

specific staining. We show ACE2 protein is found in subsets of airway cells and is highest within

52

regions of the sinonasal cavity and pulmonary alveoli, sites of presumptive viral transmission

53

and severe disease development for COVID-19, respectively. We show age, sex, and

54

comorbidities do not increase ACE2 protein expression in the human respiratory tract.

55
56

Implications of all the available evidence:

57

ACE2 protein abundance does not correlate with risk factors for severe clinical outcomes, but in

58

some cases showed an inversed relationship. Features driving COVID-19 susceptibility and

59

severity are complex, our data suggests factors other than ACE2 protein abundance as important

60

determinants of clinical outcomes.

Introduction:

62

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the cellular receptor for both severe acute

63

respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2 (1, 2). SARS-CoV caused a

64

pneumonia outbreak in 2002-2003 with a mortality rate of 9·6% and over 800 deaths worldwide

65

(3). SARS-CoV-2 is the etiologic agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which was first

66

recognized in December 2019 and has now reached pandemic proportions (2, 4). SARS-CoV-2

67

infection can be fatal, with the risk for increased disease severity correlating with advanced age

68

and underlying comorbidities, while children and younger individuals generally have milder

69

disease (5-11). These trends in disease severity could reflect differences in ACE2 distribution

70

and expression in the respiratory tract.

71
72

Previous studies have evaluated ACE2 expression in the respiratory tract. Studies of ACE2

73

mRNA transcript abundance have provided conflicting interpretations, as well as a lack of

74

protein validation (12-19). ACE2 protein studies have been limited by a paucity of lung tissue

75

substrates and reports that have yielded contradictory results (20-23) (Supplemental Table 1). It

76

is reported that some clinical factors (sex, age, or presence of comorbidities) could influence

77

ACE2 expression in the human lower respiratory tract. The ACE2 gene resides on the X

78

chromosome and therefore could be differentially regulated between males and females due to

79

variable X-inactivation (24). Increased abundance of circulating ACE2 protein is reported to

80

correlate with male sex, advanced age, and chronic comorbidities such as diabetes,

81

cardiovascular disease, and renal disease (reviewed in (25)). Recent single-cell mRNA

82

sequencing (scRNA-seq) studies of respiratory tract cells have reported contradictory evidence

83

regarding the correlation between ACE2 transcript abundance and age, sex, smoking status, and

84

other comorbidities (12-17).

85
86

We investigated the hypothesis that ACE2 drives disease severity in susceptible patient

87

populations through enhanced abundance or distribution in different locations or cell types of the

88

respiratory tract. We reanalyzed publicly available scRNA-seq data from distal lung biopsies

89

(26), nasal brushings, and nasal turbinate samples (27) to evaluate ACE2 transcript abundance in

90

specific cell types. We complemented these analyses with optimized and validated ACE2

91

immunostaining protocols, to corroborate single cell analyses as well as to screen for differences

92

in cellular ACE2 protein in lung tissues derived from a cohort of control and chronic diseased

93

patients.

Materials and methods:

95
96

Ethics:

97

Studies on human tissues were approved by the institutional review board of the University of

98

Iowa (Iowa IRB #199507432). Informed consent was obtained for all the tissues included in the

99

study.

100
101

Tissues:

102

Tissues included nasal biopsies (n=3, deidentified and lacked evidence of significant disease or

103

cancer), lung donors (n=29), primary cell cultures (28), and autopsy tissues (control tissues such

104

as small intestine and kidney) that were selected from archival repositories as formalin-fixed

105

paraffin-embedded blocks. All lungs were derived either from living donors at lung transplant or

106

from deceased individuals maintained on life support for organ donation. In either case, lung

107

tissues were routinely harvested according to transplant guidelines to maintain tissue viability.

108

Lungs were surgically resected, placed in chilled media and transported to lab for examination,

109

sample collection and fixation. Lung cases were selected to comprise two case study groups: 1)

110

Chronic disease group was defined as having chronic comorbidities including: asthma,

111

cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, diabetes, and

112

smoking. 2) Control group was defined as lacking these chronic comorbidities and lacking

113

clinical lung disease. The definition of chronic comorbidities was informed by reported

114

independent risk factors for mortality in COVID-19 (8-10). The cumulative cohort included 29

115

cases (15 chronic comorbidities and 14 controls) with a broad range of ages (0·5 – 71 years) and

116

both sexes were represented (13 female and 16 male). For these lungs, if a trachea or bronchus

117

tissue block was available from the same case – these were included as well (Supplemental Table

118

2). Bronchioles were observed in most lung sections and were defined as intrapulmonary airways

119

lacking evidence of cartilage or submucosal glands (29). Detailed medical histories other than

120

diagnoses, including medication history, were not available.

121
122

Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence:

123

All formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues were sectioned (~4 µm) and hydrated through a

124

series of xylene and alcohol baths to water. Immunohistochemical techniques were used for the

125

following markers: angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (30), surfactant protein C (SP-C)

126

(31), and mucin 5B (MUC5B) (32). For more specifics about the reagents please see

127

Supplemental Table 3.

128
129

The immunostaining protocols for ACE2 were rigorously optimized and validated to avoid

130

nonspecific staining that is commonplace and give confidence in the sensitivity of the protocol

131

and quality of the tissues (Supplemental Figure 4, Supplemental Table 1 and Supplemental Table

132

3). We analyzed ACE2 protein expression in human upper and lower respiratory tract by

133

immunohistochemistry (Supplemental Table 2). Human respiratory tract tissues were scored for

134

ACE2 expression by a masked pathologist, following principles for reproducible tissue scores

135

(17).

136
137

For immunofluorescence, formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded human lung blocks were

138

sectioned (~4 µm). Slides were baked (55°C x 15 min) and then deparaffinized (hydrated) in a

139

series of xylene and progressive alcohol baths. Antigen retrieval was performed using Antigen

Unmasking Solution (1:100, #H-3300) in citrate buffer (pH 6·0) solution to induce epitope

141

retrieval (5 min x 3 times) in the microwave. Slides were washed (PBS, 3 times, 5 min each) and

142

a PAP pen used to encircle the tissue. Slides were blocked with background blocking solution

143

(2% BSA in Superblock 1 hr in humid chamber). Primary antibodies anti-ACE2 (1:100, Mouse

144

monoclonal, MAB933, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN USA) and anti-TMPRSS2 (1:200,

145

Rabbit monoclonal, #ab92323, Abcam, Cambridge, MA USA) were diluted in blocking solution

146

(2% BSA in Superblock overnight 4°C). Secondary antibodies anti-mouse Alexa568 (for ACE2)

147

and anti-rabbit Alexa488 (for TMPRSS2) were applied at a concentration of 1:600 for 1 hour at

148

room temperature. Slides were washed and mounted with Vectashield containing DAPI.

149
150

Tissue scoring:

151

Stained tissue sections were examined for ACE2 localization using a post-examination method

152

for masking and scored by a masked pathologist following principles for reproducible tissue

153

scores (33). The initial examination showed a low heterogenous incidence of ACE2 staining for

154

various tissues, so the following ordinal scoring system was employed to quantify number of

155

staining-positive cells: 0 = below the limit of detection; 1 = <1%; 2 = 1-33%; 3 = 34-66%; and 4

156

= >66% of cells. For these anatomic regions (e.g. airway or alveoli), cell counts for each tissue

157

were made to know the population density per microscopic field to make reproducible

158

interpretations. For determination of AT2 cell size, ACE2 and SP-C protein immunostaining

159

were evaluated on the same lung tissue section for each case. A region of minimally diseased

160

lung was examined and SP-C+ AT2 cells were measured for diameter in the plane perpendicular

161

to the basement membrane. Similar measurements were then made for ACE2+/SP-C+ cells.

163

Analysis of single cell RNA sequencing data:

164

Single cell RNA sequencing data sets were accessed from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)

165

series GSE121600 (27) and GSE122960 (26). We included samples in our analysis if over 75%

166

cell barcodes had >3000 unique molecular identifiers (UMI) in order to allow accurate cell type

167

calls and clustering. Within samples passing our inclusion criteria, we retained cell barcodes with

168

>1000 UMI. For GSE121600, raw H5 files for bronchial biopsy (GSM3439925), nasal brushing

169

(GSM3439926), and turbinate (GSM3439927) samples were downloaded. Within series

170

GSE121600, sample GSM3439925 (bronchial biopsy), 82% cell barcodes had less than 3000

171

UMI, so the sample was excluded from analysis. The turbinate sample was a biopsy from a 30-

172

year-old female and the nasal brushing was performed in the inferior turbinate of a 56-year-old

173

healthy male donor. For GSE122960, filtered H5 files for eight lung transplant donor samples

174

from lung parenchyma (GSM3489182, GSM3489185, GSM3489187, GSM3489189,

175

GSM3489191, GSM3489193, GSM3489195, GSM3489197) were downloaded. The eight

176

donors varied from 21-63 years of age (median age = 48) and were composed of five African

177

American, one Asian, and two white donors, and 2 active, 1 former, and 5 never smokers. Gene

178

count matrices from the eight donors were aggregated for analysis.

179
180

Gene-by-barcode count matrices were normalized, log-transformed, and scaled followed by

181

dimension reduction using principal components analysis (PCA). Principal components were

182

used to obtain uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) visualizations, and cells

183

were clustered using a shared nearest neighbor (SNN) approach with resolution parameter 0·4,

184

giving 14 clusters for nasal brushing, 15 clusters for turbinate, and 28 clusters for lung

185

parenchyma. Cell types associated with each cluster were identified by determining marker

186

genes for each cluster and comparing the list of marker genes to known cell type markers

187

(Supplemental Figure 5). All analyses were performed using R package Seurat version 3.1.1

188

(34). In the nasal brushing sample, we were unable to associate a cell type with one cluster

189

containing 776 cells (16·5%) due to low UMIs, so these cells were discarded.

190
191

For the lung parenchyma data, gene expression in alveolar type II cells for a single donor was

192

quantified by summing up gene counts for all alveolar type II cells and dividing by total UMIs

193

for all alveolar type II cells to get normalized counts, followed by rescaling the normalized

194

counts to obtain counts per million (CPM).

Statistical analyses:

197

Statistical analyses for group comparisons and tissue scoring data were performed using

198

GraphPad Prism version 8 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA USA). Mann Whitney U tests or T-

199

tests were used for group comparisons as appropriate. ACE2 protein detection in different tissues

200

was analyzed using the ordinal scoring system (0-4) and Cochran-Armitage test for trend.

206

Results:

207

In the alveoli, ACE2 transcripts were detected mostly in alveolar type II (AT2) cells (89·5% of

208

all ACE2+ cells) (Figure 1a), but specifically within a subset of these cells (1·2% of AT2 cells)

209

(Figure 1b, Supplemental Figure 1a-b). These data indicate ACE2 transcripts are uncommon in

210

most alveolar cell types. Alveoli had apical ACE2 protein only in a small number (usually ~1%

211

or less) of AT2 cells (Figure 1c), consistent with the scRNA-seq results. The identity of these

212

cells was confirmed by co-staining for surfactant protein-C. These ACE2+ AT2 cells were

213

observed within areas of alveolar collapse (Figures 1d-f) and had morphologic features of

214

hyperplastic AT2 cells, being more plump and larger than ACE2- AT2 cells in the same tissue

215

section (Figure 1g). Interestingly, alveolar macrophages were negative for ACE2 protein staining

216

by immunohistochemistry, despite previous reports of ACE2 protein in these cells (Supplemental

217

Table 1). The lack of ACE2 transcripts in macrophages was also confirmed by scRNA-seq data

218

that revealed ACE2 mRNA in only 0·1% of macrophages, monocytes, or dendritic cells

219

(Supplemental Figure 1a-b). The concordance between scRNA-seq and immunohistochemistry

220

results provides compelling evidence that ACE2 is primarily present in a subset of AT2 cells and

221

that alveolar macrophages lack ACE2.

222
223

Recent evidence indicates that proteases such as TMPRSS2 facilitate entry of SARS-CoV-2 into

224

ACE2+ cells (35). We evaluated scRNA-seq data and observed that TMPRSS2 mRNA was

225

present in 35·5% of all AT2 cells (Figure 2a) but was more prevalent (50·0%) in ACE2+ AT2

226

cells (Figure 2b). Additionally, we observed colocalization of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 on the apical

227

membrane of these AT2 cells (Figure 2c). These findings suggest that AT2 cells with apical

11

228

ACE2 and TMPRSS2 could readily facilitate SARS-CoV-2 cellular infection and disease as seen

229

in COVID-19 patients.

230
231

We next evaluated ACE2 in the conducting airways (trachea, bronchi, bronchioles). In the

232

trachea and bronchi, apical ACE2 was rare and limited to ciliated cells (Figure 3a), similar to

233

localization results in primary cultures of well-differentiated human airway epithelial cells (30).

234

In the submucosal glands of large airways, occasional serous cells and vessels near the acini

235

were positive for ACE2 (Supplemental Figures 2a-b). In bronchioles, ACE2 was regionally

236

localized (Figures 3b-d). These findings show nominal detection of ACE2, corresponding with

237

the lack of primary airway disease (e.g., bronchitis, etc.) seen in COVID-19 patients.

238
239

Detection of ACE2 protein has been variably reported in several small studies (21, 23). In this

240

larger study, we saw that the regional distribution of ACE2 protein varied between donors. In the

241

surface epithelium of trachea and bronchi, we detected ACE2 in only 12% and 27% of donors,

242

respectively (Figure 4a). In the distal areas of the lung, ACE2 detection was more common, with

243

bronchiolar and alveolar protein detection in 36% and 59% of donors, respectively (Figure 4a). A

244

similar pattern of variable alveolar ACE2 was seen for mRNA transcripts in the scRNA-seq data,

245

where 50% of donors showed lower abudance in AT2 cells, and the other 50% of donors showed

246

higher abundance in the same cell type (Figure 4b). These findings suggest that ACE2

247

expression can vary between different lung regions and between individuals. Importantly, this

248

low level of cellular protein provided us with an opportunity to investigate the potential for

249

various clinical factors to increase ACE2 expression.

251

Independent risk factors associated with severe COVID-19 include male sex, increased age, and

252

presence of comorbidities (6, 8-10, 36-38). To evaluate whether the spatial distribution and

253

abundance of ACE2 protein in the lower respiratory tract differed by these risk factors, we

254

scored tissues for ACE2 protein detection (Supplemental Table 2). In the cohort, neither age nor

255

sex were associated with ACE2 protein detection (using the median age as cut-off) (Figures 4c-

256

d). Since recent studies of COVID-19 infections suggested that young children have reduced

257

disease severity when infected by SARS-CoV-2 (6, 7), we compared lung tissue samples from

258

children <10 years of age to those from the remaining older subjects (19-71 years of age) and

259

found that ACE2 protein detection was higher in this subset of young children (Figure 4e). To

260

test whether ACE2 distribution was affected by the presence of underlying diseases, we assessed

261

the ACE2 localization pattern using tissues from subjects with chronic comorbidities (asthma,

262

cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, diabetes, and

263

smoking) and compared them to controls (Supplemental Table 2). The control group was similar

264

in age to the chronic disease group (Figure 4f). We observed no significant differences between

265

the two groups in ACE2 distribution, except for bronchioles, where ACE2 protein was reduced

266

in the chronic disease group (Figure 4g, Supplemental Figure 2c). These results show that ACE2

267

levels in the respiratory tract were not increased in association with risk factors for severe

268

COVID-19, such as male sex, advanced age, and underlying chronic comorbidities. Instead, we

269

saw increased ACE2 detection in children <10 years of age and in the small airways

270

(bronchioles) of individuals without chronic comorbidities in our cohort, both groups with a

271

lower risk for severe clinical disease.

show ACE2 mRNA transcripts in 2-6% of epithelial cells (Supplemental Figure 3a-d). We then

276

studied nasal biopsy tissues and found that ACE2 protein was detected in all tissue samples and,

277

when present, was seen exclusively on the apical surface of ciliated cells. Distribution varied

278

regionally based on the characteristics of the epithelium, with rare detection in thicker ciliated

279

pseudostratified epithelium, and more abundant protein in thinner epithelium (Figures 5a-g).

280

Thinner epithelial height is expected in specific regions including the floor of the nasal cavity,

281

meatuses, and paranasal sinuses (39). The sinonasal cavity is an interface between the respiratory

282

tract and the environment, and high SARS-CoV-2 viral loads can be detected in nasal swabs

283

from infected patients (40), consistent with our ACE2 expression data. This reservoir of ACE2+

284

cells may facilitate the reported transmission from individuals who have very mild or

285

asymptomatic disease (41).

Discussion:

287

A critical aspect of this study was to evaluate ACE2 protein expression and distribution by

288

immunohistochemistry to more accurately corroborate single cell transcript studies and better

289

evaluate clinical groups for COVID-19 disease susceptibility. Previously, limited reports have

290

variably shown ACE2 protein in the upper and lower respiratory tract, but cellular localization

291

and distribution in human lung tissues have been inconsistent and contradictory (20-23)

292

(Supplemental Table 1). In vitro studies demonstrate that ACE2 protein is found at the apical

293

membrane of polarized airway epithelia, where it permits virus binding and cell entry (21, 30). In

294

our study, ACE2 was consistently localized to the apical membranes of cells. ACE2 was more

295

commonly found in the sinonasal cavity where transmission likely occurs and on AT2 cells of

296

the lung parenchyma where severe disease develops. We sepeculate that expression of ACE2 in

297

regions of the sinonasal cavity could explain the high transmissibility of SARS-CoV, SARS-

298

CoV-2, and HCoV-NL63, a cold-related coronavirus which also uses ACE2 as a receptor.

299
300

SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 both replicate in the lungs (42, 43), consistent with the ACE2

301

protein distribution defined in this study and suggested by previous studies (20, 21). We show

302

that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 coexpress in AT2 cells at the mRNA and protein levels, suggesting

303

susceptibility to infection. Additionally, it may also be possible that TMPRSS2- ACE2+ AT2

304

cells can become infected through the use of other airway proteases (44). AT2 cells are critical

305

for surfactant protein production and serve as progenitor cells for the AT1 cells, thus damage to

306

these AT2 cells could contribute to acute lung injury (45), which is a common feature of severe

307

COVID-19 (5). Additionally, the larger morphology of ACE2+ AT2 cells is consistent with a

308

type of hyperplastic AT2 population that, if damaged, could affect the repair mechanisms of the

309

alveoli. Infection of AT2 cells could disrupt epithelial integrity leading to alveolar edema, and

310

facilitate viral spread to ACE2+ interstitial cells/vessels for systemic virus dissemination, given

311

that SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in pulmonary endothelium (46) and blood (47).

312

Furthermore, cell-to-cell spread of coronaviruses to other epithelial cells after initial infection

313

could also occur via receptor-independent mechanisms related to the fusogenic properties of the

314

S protein (48). It is interesting that computerized tomography studies of early disease in people

315

with COVID-19 demonstrate patchy ground glass opacities in the peripheral and posterior lungs,

316

regions that are more susceptible to alveolar collapse (49).

317
318

ACE2 protein detection in the lower respiratory tract was heterogeneous. The relatively small

319

number of ACE2+ cells found in our study proved advantageous in evaluating whether

320

conditions that predispose to severe disease also increased cellular ACE2 expression, but this

321

was not observed. Rather we saw elevated ACE2 protein in demographic pools with expected

322

low risk for severe COVID-19 (young children and in bronchioles of the control group) and

323

these results suggest alternative explanations. First, the potential relationship between ACE2

324

abundance in the respiratory tract and severe COVID-19 is likely complex. On one hand, more

325

receptor availability could enhance viral entry into cells and worsen disease outcomes;

326

alternatively, ACE2 may play a protective role in acute lung injury through its enzymatic activity

327

(50-52) and therefore could improve disease outcomes. Our data would support the latter and

328

implicate a dualistic role for ACE2 as both a viral receptor and a protective agent in acute lung

329

injury. Additionally, ACE2 exists in cell-associated and soluble forms (53). It is possible that

330

greater ACE2 expression could result in increased soluble ACE2 in respiratory secretions where

331

it might act as a decoy receptor and reduce virus entry (1, 54). Second, other factors such as
16

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.22.056127; this version posted August 13, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

332

TMPRSS2 expression might be more important in regulating disease severity. TMPRSS2 on the

333

apical membrane of AT2 cells might facilitate SARS-CoV-2 entry when ACE2 is rare or even

334

below the limit of detection in this study. Third, low levels of the receptor could be sufficient for

335

the virus to infect and cause severe disease. Importantly, unlike SARS or HCoV-NL63, the

336

SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoproteins undergo proteolytic processing at a multibasic S1/S2 site by

337

furin intracellularly, prior to virion release (35, 55). Additionally, compared to SARS-CoV, the

338

SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding motif has a higher affinity for ACE2 (56, 57). These features may

339

enhance the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to bind to cells, undergo S2’ cleavage by TMPRSS2 or other

340

surface proteases, fuse to the host cell membrane, and release its genome. Finally, we

341

acknowledge that it is possible that SARS-CoV-2 infection could modify ACE2 expression in

342

the respiratory tract, or that ACE2 expression in other organs could impact disease severity. It is

343

important to mention that the lack of correlation between SARS-CoV-2 receptor expression and

344

disease severity contrasts with another severe coronavirus disease, MERS, where comorbidities

345

were observed to increase its receptor detection in respiratory tissues (58, 59).

346
347

mRNA transcript abundance is not always representative of protein levels (60), and therefore

348

both should be evaluated in conjunction before making conclusions about gene expression. Some

349

of the factors that account for these differences include post-transcriptional regulation or rapid

350

protein turnover. Additionally, other factors limit direct comparisons between scRNA-seq results

351

and protein staining, including sample size, tissue heterogeneity, and undefined biopsy sites. In

352

the alveoli, we show ACE2 protein in a small subset of AT2 cells, which correlates with the

353

scRNA-seq data and with other RNA sequencing publications (14, 18, 19). In the lower airways

354

and sinonasal cavity, RNA sequencing data indicate ACE2 transcripts in both ciliated and

355

secretory cells (14, 18, 19), but we show ACE2 protein is only found in ciliated cells. Likewise,

356

some authors have reported lower ACE2 transcript abundance in children (12, 15) and suggested

357

this finding as an explanation for the lower disease severity in this age group. In contrast, we

358

show that children do not have less ACE2 protein than older adults, and while children appear

359

protected from severe lung disease, they are likely at similar risk for infection (7, 61, 62).

360
361

In summary, we find that ACE2 protein has heterogeneous expression in the respiratory tract

362

with more frequent ACE2 detection in the sinonasal epithelium and AT2 cells that correlates

363

with putative sites for transmission and severe disease, respectively. The small subset of ACE2+

364

AT2 cells in the lung could be further studied to reveal factors regulating ACE2 expression and

365

clarify potential targets for antiviral therapies. Contrary to our initial hypothesis, we saw no

366

increase of ACE2 protein in the chronic disease group. Interestingly, we observed increased

367

ACE2 in young children and control group bronchioles, suggesting a possible protective effect

368

by ACE2 expression. These results suggest that features driving disease susceptibility and

369

severity are complex. Factors other than ACE2 protein abundance, including viral load, host

370

innate and adaptive immune responses, and the activities of the pulmonary renin-angiotensin

371

system may also be important determinants of outcomes.
