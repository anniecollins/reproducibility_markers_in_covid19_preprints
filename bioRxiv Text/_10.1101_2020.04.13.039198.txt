Abstract: The recent Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes an immense health crisis to global public
health. The COVID-19 is the etiologic agent of a recently arose disease caused by the severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Presently, there is no vaccine available against this emerged viral disease.
Therefore, it is indeed a need of the hour to develop an effectual and safe vaccine against this decidedly pandemic
disease. In the current study, we collected SARS-CoV-2 genome which is prominent in India against human host,
further more using reverse vaccinology here we claim effective vaccine candidates that can be mile stone in battle
against COVID19. This novel study divulged one promising antigenic peptide GVYFASTEK from surface
glycoprotein (protein accession no. - QIA98583.1) of SARS-CoV-2, which was predicated to be interacted with
MHC alleles and showed up to 90% conservancy and high value of antigenicity. Subsequently, the molecular
docking and simulation studies were verified molecular interaction of this prime antigenic peptide with the residues
of HLA-A*11-01 allele for MHC Class I. After vigorous analysis, this peptide was predicted to be suitable epitope
which is capable to induce the strong cell-mediated immune response against the SARS-CoV-2. Consequences from
the current study could facilitate selecting SARS-CoV-2 epitopes for vaccine production pipelines in the immediate
future. This novel research will certainly pave the way for a fast, reliable and virtuous platform to provide timely
countermeasure of this dangerous pandemic disease, COVID-19.

Keywords: COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, Reverse vaccinology, Molecular docking, Molecular dynamics simulation,

1. Introduction
The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) begin in December 2019, like a viral outbreak in Wuhan city of
China (Holshue et al., 2020). It gained rapid foothold across the world resulting in WHO declared it as a pandemic
(https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/11/who-declares-the-coronavirus-outbreak-a-global-pandemic.html).

WHO(https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/).Coronaviruses have long been recognized as crucial veterinary
pathogens, causing enteric and respiratory diseases in mammals as well as in birds(Adeoye, Oso, Olaoye, Tijjani, &
Adebayo, 2020). The SARS-CoV-2 virus spreads primarily through saliva, droplets, or discharges from the nose of
an infected person after coughing or sneezing (Pant, Singh, Ravichandiran, Murty, & Srivastava, 2020). The
coronaviruses are enveloped RNA viruses having the largest genome among all RNA (Sinha et al., 2020). As no
drug or vaccine is available against SARS-CoV-2 many countries, including India has announced lockdown to keep
away from further spread of the virus(Umesh, Kundu, Selvaraj, Singh, & Dubey, 2020).
In this period of time when the continuous transmission of the virus across borders and health burden on the global
scale is rapidly increasing, more urgent studies are required and in the absence of effective cures majorly drugs,
vaccination or immunization therapy is imperative in order to target whole population. Likewise to move forward
vaccine development pipeline, immunoinfomatics tools have been proved crucial(S. Mishra & Sinha, 2009). There
is less knowledge about the pathogenesis of the virus; therefore, an immunoinformatics-based approach to
investigate the immunogenic epitopes is required(Enayatkhani et al., 2020).
Since the Covid19 has affected almost all of the world's population, promiscuous epitopes binding to a variety of
HLA alleles for larger dissemination is vital. For that, in silico approaches will be remarkably useful in helping to
develop a cure in as fast manner as possible(D. Mishra, 2020). The antibody generation by activation of B-cell as
well as acute viral clearance by T-cells along with virus-specific memory generation by CD8+ T-cells are
analogously important to develop immunity against the virus(Enjuanes et al., 2016). The S protein is considered to
be highly antigenic and thereby can evoke strong immune responses and generate neutralizing antibodies that can
block the attachment of virus to the host cells(Du et al., 2009).
In reverse vaccinology, various tools of in silico biology are used to discover the novel antigens by studying the
genetic makeup of a pathogen and the genes that could lead to good epitopes are determined. The reverse
vaccinology approach provide fast and cost effective vaccine discovery plateform(Ullah, Sarkar, & Islam, 2020). In

reverse vaccinology approach a novel antigen is identified using omics analysis of target organism. In-silico as well
as reverse vaccinology approach facilitates an easier, time and labor saving process of antigen discovery(Gupta,
Gupta, & Niraj, 2019).
Herein, we explored the proteome of SARS-CoV-2, prominent in Indian geographical origin against human host to
identify potential antigenic proteins and epitopes that can effectively elicit cellular mediated immune response
against COVID-19. This significant research disclosed promising antigenic peptides from surface glycoprotein of
SARS-CoV-2. The outcomes from this very significant analysis could help selecting SARS-CoV-2 epitopes for
vaccine production pipelines soon.

2. Methodology

2.1 Selection of strain
The highly virulent strain SARS-CoV-2 was selected for in-silico study. The complete genome of SARS-CoV-2 is
available on the National Center for Biotechnology Information or NCBI(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) with
RefSeq NC_045512.2

2.2 Protein Identification and Retrieval
Twelve viral protein sequences of SARS-CoV2 against (Host: Human, Country: India) were retrieved from ViPR
database(Pickett et al., 2012). These proteins were: Orf10 protein (QIA98591.1), Orf8 protein (QIA98589.1), Orf7a
protein (QIA98588.1), Orf6 protein (QIA98587.1), Orf3a protein (QIA98584.1), Membrane glycoprotein
(QIA98586.1), Envelope protein (QIA98585.1), Surface glycoprotein (QIA98583.1), Surface glycoprotein
(QHS34546.1),

Nucleocapsid

protein

(QII87776.1),

Nucleocapsid

protein

(QII87775.1)

and

Nucleocapsidphosphoprotein (QIA98590.1).

2.3 Physicochemical Property Prediction
The ExPASy’s online tool ProtParam (Walker, 2005) was used to predict various physicochemical properties of the
selected protein sequences.

available under aCC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license.

2.4 Protein Antigenicity
VaxiJen v2.0 (Doytchinova & Flower, 2007) was used to predict antigenicity of proteins. This software uses FASTA
file format of amino acid sequences as an input and on the basis of physicochemical properties of proteins,
antigenicity is predicted by the tool. The output is denoted according to an antigenic score (Meunier et al., 2016).
During analysis, the threshold was kept at 0.4.

2.5 B-cell and T-cell Epitope Prediction
The B-cell and T-cell epitopes of the selected surface glycoprotein sequence was predicted via IEDB (The Immune
Epitope Database). The IEDB database holds large amount of experimental data on epitopes and antibodies. It
allows robust analysis on many epitopes in the context of some tools like: conservation across antigens, population
coverage, and clusters with similar sequences (Vita et al., 2019). In order to obtain MHC class-I restricted CD8+
cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes of the selected surface glycoprotein sequence, NetMHCpan EL 4.0
prediction method was applied for HLA-A*11-01 allele. For MHC class-II restricted CD4+ helper T-lymphocyte
(HTL) epitopes were obtained for HLA DRB1*04-01 allele using Sturniolo prediction method. Top ten MHC class-I
and MHC class-II epitopes were randomly selected on the basis of their percentile scores and antigenicity scores
(AS). Five random B-cell lymphocyte epitopes (BCL) were selected based on of their higher length using Bipipered
linear epitope prediction method(Ullah et al., 2020).

2.6 Antigenicity and Allergenicity of the predicted epitopes
VaxiJen v2.0 was utilized to predict protein antigenicity. During antigenicity analysis, threshold was kept at 0.4. The
allergenicity of the selected epitopes was predicted via AllerTOP v2(https://www.ddg-pharmfac.net/AllerTOP/).

2.7 Transmembrane Helix and Toxicity Prediction of the predicated epitopes
The transmembrane helix of the selected epitopes was predicted using the TMHMM v2.0 server
(http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/). The server predicts whether the epitope would be transmembrane,
remain inside or outside of the membrane. The toxicity prediction of the selected epitopes was carried out via
ToxinPred server https://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/toxinpred/protein.php.

available under aCC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license.

2.8 Prediction of Conservancy for the Selected Epitopes
The conservancy analysis of the epitopes was performed via the epitope conservancy analysis tool of IEDB server
(Vita et al., 2019). During analysis, the sequence identity threshold was kept at ‘>=50’.

2.9 The MHC Alleles; Cluster analysis
Cluster analysis was carried out by MHCcluster 2.0 (Thomsen, Lundegaard, Buus, Lund, & Nielsen, 2013). During
cluster analysis, the number of peptides to be included was kept at 50,000, the number of bootstrap calculations were
kept at 100. For cluster analysis, the NetMHCpan-2.8 prediction method was used.

2.10. Generation of the 3D Structures of the Selected Epitopes
The PEP-FOLD3 online tool was used to predict 3D structures of the selected best epitopes (http://bioserv.rpbs.univparis-diderot.fr/services/PEP-FOLD3/). This server is a tool for generating de novo peptide 3-D structure (Lamiable
et al., 2016; Shen, Maupetit, Derreumaux, & Tufféry, 2014; Thévenet et al., 2012).

2.11. Molecular Docking and Molecular Dynamics Simulation
Pre-docking was carried out by UCSF Chimera (Pettersen et al., 2004). The peptide-protein docking of the selected
epitopes was carried out by online docking tool PatchDock(https://bioinfo3d.cs.tau.ac.il/PatchDock/php.php) results
of PatchDock were refined and re-scored by FireDock server (http://bioinfo3d.cs.tau.ac.il/FireDock/php.php). Later
on, docking was performed by HPEPDOCK server(Zhou, Jin, Li, & Huang, 2018). Docking pose analysis was done
by using Ligplot(Wallace, Laskowski, & Thornton, 1995). The molecular simulation was executed with
GROMACS 2018.1 package with the force field as Gromos43a1. The protein salvation was performed with SPC
water model in a cubic box (10.8 × 10.8 × 10.8 nm3). The solvated system of protein was processed for energy
minimization using the steepest algorithm up to a maximum 25,000 steps or until the maximum force (Fmax) is not
greater than 1000 kJ/ mol nm which is the default threshold. The NVT and NPT ensembles for 50,000 steps (100 ps)
at 300 K and 1 atm. Here, the system was firstly equilibrated using NVT ensemble followed by NPT ensemble.
Then after the final Molecular Dynamic Simulation was performed for dock complex of [GVYFASTEK epitope
docked against the HLA-A*11-01 allele (PDB ID: 5WJL)]. Finally, the simulations were evaluated RMSD and

3.2 Physicochemical Property Analysis and Protein Antigenicity
The physicochemical property analysis like number of amino acids, the molecular weights, theoretical pI, extinction
coefficients (in M-1 cm-1), Est. half-life (in mammalian cell), instability indexes, aliphatic indexes and grand
average of hydropathicity (GRAVY) of the twelve proteins were predicted (Table-2). For antigenicity prediction
threshold value kept at 0.4, all proteins were found to be antigenic (Table-3). The physicochemical study revealed
that the surface glycoprotein (QIA98583.1) had the comparatively maximum extinction co-efficient of 148960M-1
cm-1 and lowest GRAVY value of -0.077. In addition, surface glycoprotein was stable and antigenic. We selected
this surface glycoprotein for further analysis.

3.3 T-cell and B-cell Epitope Prediction
The T-cell epitopes of MHC class-I was determined by NetMHCpan EL 4.0 prediction method of the IEDB server
keeping the sequence length 9. The server generated epitopes further analyzed on the basis of the antigenicity scores
(AS) and percentile scores, top ten potential epitopes were selected randomly for antigenicity, allergenicity, toxicity
and conservancy tests. The server ranks the predicted epitopes based on the ascending order of percentile scores
(Table-4a). The T-cell epitopes of MHC class-II (HLA DRB1*04-01 allele) of the protein was also determined by
IEDB server (Table-4b). , where the Sturniolo prediction methods was used. For protein, ten out of the top ranked
epitopes were selected randomly for further analysis. Additionally, the B-cell epitopes of the protein was selected
using Bipipered linear epitope prediction method of the IEDB server and the selection of epitopes were based on
their higher lengths (Fig-1).

3.4. Antigenicity, allergenicity, toxicity and conservancy analysis of the epitopes
The selected T-cell epitopes found to be highly antigenic as well as non-allergenic, non-toxic, and had conservancy
of greater than 90%. Among the ten selected MHC class-I epitopes and ten selected MHC class-II epitopes, total
four epitopes were selected based on the mentioned criteria: GVYFASTEK, TLADAGFIK, NFRVQPTESI and
LLIVNNATNV.

3.5. Cluster Analysis of the MHC Alleles
The cluster analysis of the MHC class-I alleles that will possibly interact with the predicted epitopes were carried
out by online tool MHCcluster 2.0 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/MHCcluster/). The tool generates the clusters of
the alleles in phylogenetic manner. The Results illustrate the outcome of the experiment where the red zone
indicates strong interaction and the yellow zone corresponds to weaker interaction (Fig-2).

3.7 Peptide-Protein Docking &Vaccine candidate’s prioritization
The Molecular Docking study was performed to observe, whether all the epitopes had the capacity to bind with the
MHC class-I and MHC class-II molecule. The selected epitopes were docked with the HLA-A*11-01 allele (PDB
ID: 5WJL) and HLA DRB1*04-01 (PDB ID: 5JLZ). The docking was performed using PatchDock online docking
tool and then the results were refined by FireDock online server. Results were also analyzed by HPEPDOCK server
(Supplementary Figure: S2). Among the Four epitopes of selected glycoprotein QIA98583.1, GVYFASTEK
(MHC class I epitope) showed the best result with the lowest global energy of -52.82. Further, docking pose was
analyzed via Ligplot (Fig 4a) and docking site can be clearly visualized in (Fig 4b). We also identified highly
antigenic and non-allergenic B-cell vaccine candidates LTPGDSSSGWTAG and VRQIAPGQTGKIAD from the
selected Surface glycoprotein (QIA98583.1).

4. Discussion
Vaccine is enormously imperative and expansively formed therapeutic products. Millions of infants and people are
getting vaccinated every year. However, the development and research processes of vaccines are expensive and
occasionally, it requires countless months to prepare and advance an appropriate vaccine candidate towards killing
of a pathogen. In today’s scenario, innumerable tools and approaches of immunoinformatics, Computer-aided drug
design (CADD), bioinformatics and converse/reverse vaccinology stance extensively castoff towards the
progression of vaccine preparations, which intern reduce prolong duration and price investment on vaccine
expansion (Islam et al., 2020; María, Arturo, Alicia, Paulina, & Gerardo, 2017; Ullah et al., 2020).
In current study, the physicochemical study revealed that surface glycoprotein QIA98583.1 exhibited upper most
extinction co-efficient of 148960M-1 cm-1 and lowest GRAVY value of -0.077. In addition, this selected surface
glycoprotein was highly stable (instability index of less than 40) and antigenic. The antigenicity of the protein was
determined by VaxiJen V2.0 server. If a compound required variability index greater than 40, means the product is
considered as unbalanced (Guruprasad, Reddy, & Pandit, 1990). The extinction coefficient referred to the quantity

of light, that is captivated by a complex at a particular wavelength (Ikai, 1980; Pace, Vajdos, Fee, Grimsley, & Gray,
1995). Various physicochemical properties including the amount of amino acids, molecular mass/weight, theoretic
pI, extinction co-efficient, uncertainty index, aliphatic index, GRAVY was resolute by ProtParam
(https://web.expasy.org/protparam/) server.
In the immune system, two major functioning cells are B and T lymphocytic cells, which are responsible for several
defended roles in the body. Once identified by an antigen presenting cell or APC (such as dendritic cell, macrophage
etc.), the antigen is accessible by the MHC class-II molecule existing on the exterior of these usual APCs, to the
helper T cell. Subsequently, the helper T cell comprehends CD4+ fragment on its exterior, it is correspondingly
termed as CD4+ T cell. Later stimulated by APC, the helper-T cells subsequently stimulate the B cell and reasons to
yield antibody constructing plasma B cell alongside memory B cell. The plasma B cell harvests many antibodies and
the memory B cell purposes as the immunological, elongated tenure memory. Nevertheless, macrophage and CD8+
cytotoxic T cell are also triggered by the helper-T cell that abolishes the target antigen (Arpin et al., 1995; Cano &
Lopera, 2013; Goerdt & Orfanos, 1999; Pavli, Hume, Van De Pol, & Doe, 1993; Tanchot & Rocha, 2003).
The possible B and T cell epitopes of the designated SARS-CoV-2 viral protein was identified by the IEDB
(https://www.iedb.org/) server. The IEDB server generates and ranks the epitopes on the basis of their antigenicity
scores (AS) and percentile scores. The top ten MHC class-I and class-II epitopes were engaged for investigation.
The

of

the

epitopes

was

resolute

by

TMHMM

v2.0

server

(http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/). In all the inflammatory situations such as allergenicity, antigenicity,
toxicity and conservancy examination, the T-cell epitopes those were found to be exceedingly antigenic with higher
immune response without allergies, non-toxic, and required conservancy of over 90%. Amongst ten certain MHC
class-I and ten selected MHC class-II epitopes of the protein, over-all four epitopes were designated based on the
revealed measures: GVYFASTEK, TLADAGFIK, NFRVQPTESI and LLIVNNATNVV as well as antigenic and
non-allergenic B-cell epitopes were selected for added vaccine candidate investigation. The cluster examination of
the conceivable MHC class-I and MHC class-II alleles that might interrelate with the prophesied epitopes were
performed by the online tool MHC cluster 2.0 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/MHCcluster/). The antigenicity,
demarcated as the capability of a extraneous ingredient to act as an antigen and stimulate the B and T cell replies,
over their epitope correspondingly baptized antigenic determinant portion (Fishman, Wiles, & Wood, 2015). The

allergenicity is well-defined as the capability of that ingredient to act as an allergen and persuade latent allergic
responses inside the host being (Andreae & Nowak-Węgrzyn, 2017).
Moreover, the cluster scrutiny of the MHC class-I and II alleles were similarly performed to categorize their
association with each other and bunch them based on their functionality and foretold requisite specificity(Thomsen
et al., 2013). Subsequently in the following steps, the peptide-protein docking was performed amongst the chosen
epitopes and the MHC alleles. The MHC class-I epitopes stayed docked to the MHC class-I molecule (PDB ID:
5WJL) and the MHC class-II epitopes were docked with the MHC class-II molecule (PDB ID: 5JLZ)
correspondingly. The peptide-protein docking was executed to evaluate the capability of the epitopes to quandary
with their particular MHC molecules. Pre-docking was performed by UCSF-chimera and afterward, 3D structure
generation of the epitopes was performed. The docking was executed by PatchDock and FireDock servers and
analyzed by HPEPDOCK server constructed on global energy. The GVYFASTEK engendered the best scores in the
peptide-protein docking respectively. All the vaccine candidates were proved to be potentially antigenic and nonallergenic, for this reason they should not cause any allergenic reaction within the host body. However, more in vitro
and in vivo examinations should be performed to lastly approve the security, usefulness and potentiality of the
predicted vaccines candidates.

5. Conclusion
In the face of enormous tragedy of suffering, demise and social adversity caused by COVID-19 pandemic. It is of
the extremely importance to develop an effectual and safe vaccine against this highly pandemic disease.
Bioinformatics, Reverse vaccinology and related technologies are widely used in vaccine design and development
since these technologies reduce the cost and time. In this study, first the potential proteins belong to SARS-CoV-2
against (host: human, country: India) are identified. Further, the potential B cell and T cell epitopes that can
effectively elicit cellular mediated immune response related to these selected proteins were determined through
robust processes. These potential T-cell epitope GVYFASTEK and B-cell epitopes LTPGDSSSGWTAG,
VRQIAPGQTGKIAD, QIAPGQTGKIAD and ILPDPSKPSKRS play vigorous protagonist in the subunit and multiepitope vaccine construction soon. In brief, reverse vaccinology vindicated as an authoritative means to recognize
novel vaccine candidates and their consequential exact application. This study will lead to the research in an
