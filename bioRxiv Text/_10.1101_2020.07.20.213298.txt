ABSTRACT

24

The high susceptibility of humans to SARS-CoV-2 infection, the cause of COVID-19, reflects the

25

novelty of the virus and limited preexisting B cell immunity. IgG against the SARS-CoV-2 spike

26

(S) protein, which carries the novel receptor binding domain (RBD), is absent or at low levels in

27

unexposed individuals. To better understand the B cell response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we

28

asked whether virus-reactive memory B cells (MBCs) were present in unexposed subjects and

29

whether MBC generation accompanied virus-specific IgG production in infected subjects. We

30

analyzed sera and PBMCs from non-SARS-CoV-2-exposed healthy donors and COVID-19

31

convalescent subjects. Serum IgG levels specific for SARS-CoV-2 proteins (S, including the RBD

32

and S2 subunit, and nucleocapsid [N]) and non-SARS-CoV-2 proteins were related to

33

measurements of circulating IgG MBCs. Anti-RBD IgG was absent in unexposed subjects. Most

34

unexposed subjects had anti-S2 IgG and a minority had anti-N IgG, but IgG MBCs with these

35

specificities were not detected, perhaps reflecting low frequencies. Convalescent subjects had high

36

levels of IgG against the RBD, S2, and N, together with large populations of RBD- and S2-reactive

37

IgG MBCs. Notably, IgG titers against the S protein of the human coronavirus OC43 in

38

convalescent subjects were higher than in unexposed subjects and correlated strongly with anti-S2

39

titers. Our findings indicate cross-reactive B cell responses against the S2 subunit that might

40

enhance broad coronavirus protection. Importantly, our demonstration of MBC induction by

41

SARS-CoV-2 infection suggests that a durable form of B cell immunity is maintained even if

42

circulating antibody levels wane.

43
44

IMPORTANCE

45

Recent rapid worldwide spread of SARS-CoV-2 has established a pandemic of potentially serious

46

disease in the highly susceptible human population. Key questions are whether humans have

47

preexisting immune memory that provides some protection against SARS-CoV-2 and whether

48

SARS-CoV-2 infection generates lasting immune protection against reinfection. Our analysis

49

focused on pre- and post-infection IgG and IgG memory B cells (MBCs) reactive to SARS-CoV-

50

2 proteins. Most importantly, we demonstrate that infection generates both IgG and IgG MBCs

51

against the novel receptor binding domain and the conserved S2 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 spike

52

protein. Thus, even if antibody levels wane, long-lived MBCs remain to mediate rapid antibody

53

production. Our study also suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection strengthens preexisting broad

54

coronavirus protection through S2-reactive antibody and MBC formation.

INTRODUCTION

56

The betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of a respiratory disease termed

57

COVID-19, emerged in China in late 2019 and rapidly spread worldwide (1). A pandemic was

58

declared in March 2020 and global deaths from COVID-19 now exceed 500,000. The rapid

59

increase in cases in many countries has challenged healthcare systems and shutdowns and

60

quarantine measures introduced to slow virus spread have caused major disruptions to society and

61

economies (2). SARS-CoV-2 infection produces a wide spectrum of outcomes. A proportion of

62

infections, likely more than 20%, remain asymptomatic. Most clinical cases develop mild to

63

moderate respiratory symptoms, but up to 20% progress to a more severe disease with extensive

64

pneumonia (3, 4).

65

When SARS-CoV-2 emerged and began to spread, the severity of the threat was primarily

66

attributed to the novelty of the virus to the human immune system and, consequently, a lack of

67

preexisting immune memory to quickly clear virus and limit disease progression. Four types of

68

common cold coronavirus are endemic in humans, the alphacoronaviruses 229E and NL63 and the

69

betacoronaviruses OC43 and HKU1. However, limited relatedness between key structural proteins

70

of these human coronaviruses (HCoVs) and those of SARS-CoV-2 suggested that significant

71

cross-reactive immunity was unlikely (5, 6). Initial studies of non-SARS-CoV-2-exposed

72

individuals found negligible levels of IgG against the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, the viral

73

attachment protein that binds the receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on host cells

74

to initiate infection (7). More recently, however, studies have provided evidence of SARS-CoV-

75

2-reactive B and T cell memory in unexposed subjects that could confer some protection against

76

SARS-CoV-2 or modulate disease pathogenesis.

77

Sera from non-SARS-CoV-2-exposed individuals have been screened for IgG binding to

78

the S1 and S2 subunits of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. The membrane-distal S1 subunit contains

79

the receptor binding domain (RBD) for receptor recognition, and the membrane-proximal S2,

80

which has higher homology among coronaviruses than does S1 (6, 8), mediates membrane fusion

81

to release viral RNA into the host cell. In two large cohorts of unexposed subjects, approximately

82

10% had IgG that bound S2, but not S1 or the RBD. Approximately 4% of subjects had IgG against

83

the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein, which is highly conserved among coronaviruses (9,

84

10). Although N is an internal viral protein and not a target of neutralizing antibodies (Abs),

85

coronavirus infections typically elicit strong anti-N Ab production (11). The idea that circulating

86

HCoVs elicit IgG that cross-reacts with SARS-CoV-2 is supported by the finding that SARS-CoV3

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.20.213298; this version posted July 21, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

87

2 infection increases IgG titers against the S proteins of multiple HCoVs (12). In T cell studies,

88

CD4+ T cells in up to 50% of non-SARS-CoV-2-exposed donors responded to epitopes in S and

89

non-S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 (8, 13). Notably, S-reactive CD4+ T cells in unexposed subjects

90

were mostly reactive to the conserved S2 subunit, consistent with cross-reactivity to circulating

91

HCoVs (8). SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD8+ T cells were also detected in unexposed donors, but the

92

response was less marked than for CD4+ T cells (13).

93

SARS-CoV-2-reactive memory B cells (MBCs) generated in B cell responses to HCoVs

94

are also likely to be present in non-SARS-CoV-2-exposed individuals. Indeed, MBCs might be

95

more important than preexisting cross-reactive Abs as a source of protection against SARS-CoV-

96

2. IgG MBCs are more broadly reactive than Abs generated against the same antigen, they persist

97

after circulating Ab levels wane, and they are readily activated to generate strong Ab responses or

98

seed germinal centers for additional rounds of affinity maturation (14). Concurrent early

99

production of virus-specific IgM and IgG in the response to SARS-CoV-2 infection suggests a

100

response mediated by IgG MBCs as well as naïve B cells (9, 15-17). This picture is supported by

101

identification of B cell subsets with high and low immunoglobulin V gene mutation frequencies

102

during the response to SARS-CoV-2 infection (18). However, little direct analysis of SARS-CoV-

103

2-reactive MBCs in unexposed subjects has been performed.

104

Characterization of MBCs generated and/or expanded by SARS-CoV-2 infection can also

105

provide insights into cross-reactivity between coronaviruses and participation of preexisting

106

MBCs in the response. Wec et al. (19) used cells from a survivor of the 2003 SARS-CoV outbreak

107

as a source of MBCs that bound the S protein of SARS-CoV-2; a comprehensive panel of Abs

108

expressed by the MBCs were cloned and characterized. Notably, most of the highly mutated mAbs

109

bound the S2 subunit of multiple HCoV S proteins, often with higher affinity than to the S2 of

110

SARS-CoV-2. A screening of healthy donors identified low frequencies of MBCs reactive to the

111

S proteins of the 2003 SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (19). Findings suggest that S2-reactive

112

MBCs generated by HCoVs were activated and expanded by the 2003 SARS-CoV. RBD-binding

113

MBCs sampled in the convalescent phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection expressed Abs with relatively

114

low numbers of V gene mutations, suggesting that this component of the response largely reflected

115

naïve B cell activation by novel epitopes (20).

116

To extend our understanding of the B cell response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, the current

117

study compared Ab and MBC immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in unexposed individuals and individuals

118

in the convalescent phase of infection. In particular, we were interested in the presence of SARS4

119

CoV-2-reactive MBCs in unexposed subjects that could confer some protection against SARS-

120

CoV-2, and formation of MBCs by SARS-CoV-2 infection to provide durable protection against

121

reinfection. Most importantly, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 infection generates both IgG and

122

IgG MBCs reactive to the novel RBD and the conserved S2 subunit of the S protein. Long-lived

123

MBCs are thus likely to be available to mediate rapid protective Ab responses if circulating Ab

124

levels wane and reinfection occurs. Our study also draws attention to preexisting SARS-CoV-2-

125

cross-reactive B cell memory to the S2 subunit in SARS-CoV-2-naïve subjects. We speculate that

126

the strong response to S2 after SARS-CoV-2 infection reflects preexisting S2-reactive MBC

127

activation and strengthens broad coronavirus protection.

128
129

RESULTS

130

IgG against SARS-CoV-2 proteins in unexposed subjects primarily targets the S2

131

subunit of the S protein. To investigate preexisting B cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in

132

unexposed individuals and SARS-CoV-2-reactive B cell immunity generated by infection, we

133

analyzed sera and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from (i) 21 healthy donors

134

sampled prior to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, and (ii) 26 non-hospitalized COVID-19

135

convalescent subjects sampled 4-9 weeks after symptom onset. Reactivity was measured against

136

the S (including the RBD and S2 subunit) and N proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and the S proteins of

137

the human alphacoronavirus 229E and betacoronavirus OC43. The H1 influenza virus

138

hemagglutinin and tetanus toxoid (TTd) were included as control antigens that humans are

139

commonly exposed to through infection and vaccination.

140

Serum IgG levels were measured by ELISA. Approximately one-third of non-SARS-CoV-

141

2-exposed subjects in the healthy donor cohort had low levels of serum IgG against the S and N

142

proteins of SARS-CoV-2, likely reflecting cross-reactivity with seasonal HCoVs (Figure 1A).

143

Notably, 86% of unexposed subjects had IgG against the highly conserved S2 subunit of the S

144

protein. It is possible that inherent features of the bulky S reagent used in our analysis reduced

145

binding by anti-S2 Abs. IgG that bound the highly novel RBD was not detected in unexposed

146

subjects. All non-SARS-CoV-2-exposed subjects had IgG against S proteins of the HCoVs 229E

147

and OC43, indicating previous infection, and against the control proteins H1 and TTd (Figures 1C-

148

1F).

149

S- and N-specific IgG production following SARS-CoV-2 infection includes a strong

150

response to the S2 subunit. Levels of IgG against S, RBD, S2 and N were markedly higher in

151

convalescent subjects than unexposed subjects, indicating strong induction of these Abs by SARS-

152

CoV-2 infection (Figure 1A). In a small number of convalescent subjects, high anti-S IgG titers

153

were associated with low levels of anti-N IgG. Indeed, more than 40% of convalescent subjects

154

had anti-N IgG levels within the range in unexposed subjects, questioning the reliability of using

155

anti-N IgG measurement to identify previous SARS-CoV-2 infection.

156

Notably, serum IgG titers against S2 were consistently higher than against the RBD in

157

convalescent subjects, perhaps reflecting the novelty of the RBD and a response dependent on

158

naive B cell activation (Figure 1B). Interestingly, titers of IgG were higher against the S protein

159

of the HCoV OC43 in convalescent subjects than in unexposed subjects, but this was not the case

160

for the S protein of HCoV 229E (or for the control proteins H1 and TTd) (Figures 1C-1F). The

161

anti-OC43 S IgG titers correlated with those against the SARS-CoV-2 S (rS = 0.49, P = 0.0109),

162

RBD (rS = 0.57, P =0.0025), and S2 (rS = 0.86, P<0.0001), indicating a relationship with SARS-

163

CoV-2 infection (Figure 1G). The particularly strong correlation between IgG titers against OC43

164

S and the SARS-CoV-2 S2 suggests a cross-reactive response to the S2 subunit.

165

Since the healthy donor samples in our analysis were collected 6-10 years before the

166

emergence of SARS-CoV-2, we considered the possibility that a recently circulating HCoV could

167

have been responsible for the higher anti-OC43 S IgG titers in the convalescent subjects. To

168

exclude this possibility, we measured anti-OC43 S IgG titers in sera collected from 20 healthcare

169

workers in 2020. The healthcare workers cared for hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 patients, but all were

170

negative for IgG against SARS-CoV-2 S and RBD, consistent with the effectiveness of personal

171

protective equipment and appropriate work practices. OC43 S-reactive IgG levels in healthcare

172

worker sera were similar to those in non-SARS-CoV-2-exposed healthy donor sera and

173

significantly lower than those in sera from convalescent subjects (Figure 1C). Taken together, our

174

results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 infection generates a strong IgG response that cross-reacts with

175

the S2 of human betacoronaviruses.

176

Strong S-reactive MBC formation following SARS-CoV-2 infection includes

177

reactivity to the RBD and S2 subunit. PBMCs from non-SARS-CoV-2-exposed subjects and

178

convalescent subjects were analyzed for MBCs reactive to SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Circulating

179

antigen-specific IgG MBC populations were measured by in vitro stimulation of MBCs to induce

180

differentiation into Ab-secreting cells (ASCs). Post-stimulation antigen-specific measurement of

181

MBC-derived ASCs (MASCs) by ELISpot assay or MBC-derived polyclonal Abs (MPAbs) by

182

ELISA provided a measure of the precursor MBCs (30). Analysis of MASCs by ELISpot assay

183

was performed against the SARS-CoV-2 S, RBD, and N proteins, and the influenza H1 and TTd.

184

MPAbs were measured against antigens used in the ELISpot assay, as well as SARS-CoV-2 S2,

185

and the S proteins of the HCoVs OC43 and 229E. Antigen-specific IgG MPAb concentrations

186

correlated strongly with the frequency of IgG MASCs derived from stimulated MBCs (determined

187

for SARS-CoV-2 S and RBD, influenza H1, and TTd, rS = 0.89, 0.67, 0.83, and 0.95, respectively,

188

P £ 0.0002), validating MPAb concentration as a measure of the size of specific MBC populations.

189

The presence of a low level of IgG against the SARS-CoV-2 S, RBD, and N proteins in a

190

proportion of unexposed subjects suggested that IgG MBCs with the same specificity had also

191

been formed. However, these MBCs were not detected, possibly because of very low frequencies

192

in the circulation. In contrast, IgG MBCs reactive to the S proteins of the HCoVs OC43 and 229E

193

and the control proteins H1 and TTd were detected in nearly 50% or more of non-SARS-CoV-2-

194

exposed subjects, consistent with the higher levels of serum IgG against these antigens (Figure 2E-

195

2H). As expected, SARS-CoV-2 RBD-reactive MBCs were not detected in unexposed subjects.

196

In marked contrast to non-SARS-CoV-2-exposed subjects, the vast majority of

197

convalescent subjects had circulating IgG MBCs reactive to the SARS-CoV-2 S, RBD, and S2,

198

indicating strong induction by SARS-CoV-2 infection of MBCs reactive to novel and conserved

199

regions of the S protein (Figure 2A). Notably, numbers of IgG MBCs reactive to the S protein of

200

the HCoV OC43 were higher in convalescent subjects than in unexposed subjects (Figure 1E), but

201

there was no difference between the two subject groups in IgG MBCs reactive to the HCoV 229E

202

S protein, influenza H1 or TTd (Figures 2B, 2F-2H). S2-reactive IgG MBC numbers correlated

203

well with IgG MBCs reactive to SARS-CoV-2 S (rS = 0.77, P < 0.0001) and RBD (rS = 0.60, P =

204

0.0012), and S of HCoV OC43 (rS = 0.52, P = 0.0059), but not to S of HCoV 229E (rS = -0.13, P

205

= 0.53), influenza H1 (rS = 0.13, P = 0.54), or TTd (rS = 0.29, P = 0.15). The findings of our MBC

206

analysis are consistent with serum IgG measurement and indicate that SARS-CoV-2 infection

207

generates IgG MBCs reactive to the SARS-CoV-2 S2 that cross-react with the S2 of human

208

betacoronaviruses. Interestingly, only a small proportion of the convalescent subjects generated

209

detectable N-reactive IgG MBCs, even though most subjects produced high levels of anti-N IgG

210

in serum (Figures 2C, 2D). It is unclear whether this reflects a real difference between S- and N-

211

reactive MBC formation or an effect of the sampling time. Overall, we demonstrate that SARS-

212

CoV-2 infection induces strong S-reactive MBC formation that would be expected to provide

213

lasting protection against reinfection and potentially broad protection against betacoronaviruses.

215

DISCUSSION

216

Our goals in this study were to investigate SARS-CoV-2-reactive B cell memory in

217

unexposed subjects that could provide some protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the

218

generation of B cell memory by SARS-CoV-2 infection that could provide lasting protection

219

against re-infection. In particular, we were interested in IgG MBCs, which respond to cognate

220

antigens with rapid, vigorous, and high-affinity Ab production. Importantly, MBCs are long-lived

221

cells that continue to provide strong protection when circulating Ab levels wane. Our approach

222

was to analyze circulating IgG as well as IgG MBCs from the SARS-CoV-2-naïve and SARS-

223

CoV-2-convalescent subject groups. Our key findings are as follows: (i) the presence of IgG

224

reactive to the S2 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 in most unexposed subjects, likely reflecting cross-

225

reactivity to HCoVs, (ii) markedly increased levels of IgG against the SARS-CoV-2 S and N

226

proteins, including reactivity to the RBD and S2 subunit of S, in convalescent subjects, (iii)

227

increased IgG binding to the S protein of the OC43 HCoV, but not 229E HCoV, in convalescent

228

subjects, reflecting greater cross-reactivity between S2 subunits of betacoronaviruses, (iv) strong

229

formation of IgG MBCs reactive with the RBD and S2 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein in

230

convalescent subjects, and (v) formation of IgG MBCs reactive with the S protein of OC43, but

231

not 229E, in convalescent subjects, consistent with S2 subunit cross-reactivity between

232

betacoronaviruses.

233

Approximately one-third of our cohort of non-SARS-CoV-2-exposed subjects had low

234

levels of IgG against the SARS-CoV-2 S and N proteins. The anti-N IgG likely reflects infection

235

with HCoVs, which have low level (20-30%) homology with the SARS-CoV-2 N protein (10).

236

However, a protective function for anti-N Abs has not been established (21). Notably, 86% of

237

unexposed subjects had IgG against the S2 subunit, reflecting homology with HCoVs, but none

238

had IgG against the highly novel SARS-CoV-2 RBD (6, 8, 22). Abs that target the S2 subunit have

239

been shown to have virus neutralizing activity, raising the possibility that preexisting anti-S2 IgG

240

confers some protection against SARS-CoV-2 (23). The processes that generate anti-S2 IgG are

241

also likely to generate S2-reactive IgG MBCs and these might provide more significant protection

242

than low levels of anti-S2 Abs. However, S2-reactive MBCs (or S-reactive and N-reactive MBCs)

243

were not detected in non-SARS-CoV-2-exposed subjects. Taken together with the identification

244

of S-reactive MBCs in unexposed healthy donors (19), it is likely that S2-reactive MBCs were

245

below the limit of detection in our assays. Most MBCs are resident in lymphoid tissues, except for

246

MBCs against frequently seen immunogenic antigens (for example, the influenza H1 or TTd in

247

this study), and are at very low frequencies in circulation in steady state (24, 25).

248

Anti-RBD, -S, and -N IgG levels were markedly higher in the convalescent subjects than

249

in non-SARS-CoV-2-exposed subjects, indicating strong induction by SARS-CoV-2 infection.

250

Perhaps notably, the majority of convalescent subjects had higher IgG titers against the S2 than

251

against the RBD. This is particularly surprising because of the accessibility of the RBD to B cells

252

and the expected immunodominance over the S2 subunit (26, 27). Our demonstration of strong

253

anti-S2 IgG production is consistent with the activation of a preexisting population of IgG MBCs

254

against the conserved S2 subunit in the absence of MBCs reactive to the novel RBD. However, we

255

cannot exclude inherent differences in the stability or antigenicity of RBD and S2 reagents as an

256

explanation. In convalescent subjects, IgG levels against the S protein of HCoV OC43 (but not

257

229E) were significantly higher than in non-SARS-CoV-2-exposed subjects and correlated

258

strongly with anti-S2 IgG levels. These findings support stronger B cell cross-reactivity between

259

the S2 subunits of SARS-Cov-2 and human betacoronaviruses than alphacoronaviruses (8).

260

Importantly, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 infection generates RBD-reactive and S2-

261

reactive IgG MBCs. Recently, Long et al. (4) found that levels of SARS-CoV-2-reactive Abs,

262

including neutralizing Abs, start to decrease within 8-12 weeks of infection, especially when the

263

infection is asymptomatic. Since MBC populations are maintained for many years, perhaps

264

decades, our findings indicate that MBCs generated by SARS-CoV-2 infection will be available

265

to rapidly generate protective Abs if waning Ab levels allow re-infection to occur (28). Notably,

266

three convalescent subjects in our analysis had undetectable RBD-reactive IgG, but nevertheless

267

had RBD-reactive IgG MBCs. This might reflect MBC production by germinal centers that

268

remained active after recovery from infection (29). The proportion of subjects with MBCs reactive

269

to the HCoVs OC43 and 229E was greater for the convalescent group than the unexposed group,

270

likely reflecting the increase in S2-reactive MBCs in the convalescent group and cross-reactivity

271

with HCoVs. S2-reactive MBC expansion by SARS-CoV-2 infection could enhance protection

272

against a broad range of coronaviruses (23). N-reactive MBC formation in convalescent subjects

273

was less than expected given the large number of subjects with high titers of N-reactive IgG, but

274

additional sampling times are required to confirm this observation.

275

In conclusion, our analysis investigated Ab and MBC immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in

276

unexposed subjects and individuals soon after recovery from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Findings

277

emphasized the novelty of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein RBD in unexposed subjects. However, IgG

278

reactive to the S2 was widespread in unexposed subjects and likely resulted from exposure to

279

HCoVs. Although our approach was unable to directly identify S2-reactive MBCs in the

280

unexposed subjects, we suggest that these cells are present and strongly contribute S2-reactive IgG

281

early in the response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The IgG response in SARS-CoV-2 convalescent

282

subjects was also strong against the RBD and, less consistently, against the N protein. Importantly,

283

SARS-CoV-2 convalescent subjects had generated RBD-reactive and S2-reactive IgG MBCs. The

284

RBD-reactive MBCs are likely to provide strong long-term protection if RBD-reactive neutralizing

285

Ab levels wane and re-infection occurs. Additional studies are required to establish the importance

286

of S2-reactive IgG in providing broad anti-coronavirus activity and the influence of expanded S2-

287

reactive MBC populations on a de novo B cell response to the RBD.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

290

Study participants and clinical samples. All study participants were recruited at the

291

University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY and provided written informed consent

292

prior to inclusion in the studies. The studies were approved by the University of Rochester Human

293

Research Subjects Review Board (protocols 16-0064, 07-0090, and 07-0046) and conducted in

294

accordance with the principles of Good Clinical Practice. A pre-pandemic cohort of 21 healthy

295

donors (median age 48 years, IQR 25-70) were enrolled from 2011-14 (non-SARS-CoV-2-

296

exposed subjects). A cohort of 20 healthcare workers (median age 38 years, IQR 30-52) at Strong

297

Memorial Hospital, Rochester, NY were enrolled in May, 2020. The healthcare workers had not

298

been diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to enrollment. A cohort of 26 non-hospitalized COVID-19

299

convalescent subjects (9 males and 17 females; median age 49 years, IQR 36-63) was enrolled in

300

May, 2020 and consisted of 22 PCR-confirmed patients and 5 non-PCR-confirmed subjects who

301

were contacts of confirmed cases or displayed COVID-19-like symptoms. The convalescent

302

subjects were sampled 4-9 weeks after symptom onset. Symptoms reported (percent of subjects)

303

were fever (67%) cough (74%), sore throat (48%), stuffy/runny nose (56%), difficulty breathing

304

(52%), fatigue (85%), headache (67%), body aches (67%), nausea/vomiting (19%), and

305

diarrhea/loose stool (41%).

315

MBC analysis. Measurement of antigen-specific MBCs was essentially performed as

316

described previously (30). Briefly, cryopreserved PBMCs were thawed and rested overnight at

317

37°C in complete medium. Rested PBMCs were stimulated for 6 days at 1×106 PBMCs/well in

318

24-well plates to induce MBC expansion and differentiation into ASCs. The stimulation cocktail

319

consisted of complete medium supplemented with 1 µg/ml R848 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), 10 ng/ml

320

IL-2 (Gibco, Gaithersburg, MD), and 25 ng/ml IL-10 (STEMCELL Technologies, Vancouver,

321

Canada). After stimulation, cells were harvested and pelleted by centrifugation. The undiluted

322

supernatant containing Abs secreted by ASCs generated from stimulated MBC precursors

323

(MPAbs) was collected and stored for analysis by ELISA. Supernatants from unstimulated cultures

324

of rested PBMCs were collected to control for Abs produced by preexisting ASCs. Antigen-

325

specific ASCs in the cell pellet (MASCs) were enumerated by ELISpot assay. For each antigen,

326

300,000 stimulated PBMCs were analyzed by ELISpot assay and the limit of MASC detection was

327

set at 8 spots (MASCs)/106 PBMCs. Based on ELISpot assay results, antigen-specific MBCs in

328

peripheral blood were quantified as antigen-specific IgG MASCs as a proportion of stimulated

329

PBMCs. Antigen-specific IgG concentrations in MPAb samples (after subtraction of Ab

330

concentrations in supernatants from unstimulated PBMC control cultures) were also used as a

331

measure of the relative size of reactive MBC populations.

332

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Concentrations of Ag-specific serum

333

Abs and MPAbs were measured by ELISA as previously described (30). Briefly, Nunc MaxiSorp

334

96-well plates (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA) were coated overnight with optimized

335

concentrations of antigens. Serially diluted samples were added to blocked plates and incubated

336

for 2 h at room temperature. Alkaline phosphatase conjugated anti-human IgG (clone MT78;

337

Mabtech Stockholm, Sweden) and p-nitrophenyl phosphate substrate (Thermo Fisher) were

338

subsequently added to detect bound antigen-specific Abs. Absorbance was read at 405 nm after

339

color development. A weight-based concentration method was used to quantify antigen-specific

340

Ab levels in test samples as described previously (30, 31). Sera from healthy donors and

341

convalescent subjects with high titers for test antigens were used to establish human serum

standards. The cutoff for assay positivity was set at approximately 2x the mean OD value for

343

negative wells.

344

Statistical analyses. The medians with (q1, q3) were summarized by subject group and

345

compared by the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Spearman correlation analysis together with

346

corresponding robust regression models was used to assess monotonic associations among Ab

347

responses. Multiple test adjustment was not applied for this explorative study and thus a P value

348

< 0.05 was considered significant for all analyses. Statistical analyses were performed using

349

Software SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).

Figure 2 Analysis of IgG memory B cells (MBCs) reactive to SARS-CoV-2 and non-SARS-CoV2 proteins in non-SARS-CoV-2-exposed and COVID-19 convalescent subjects. PBMCs for MBC
analysis were collected from (i) 21 healthy donors sampled from 2011-14 (HD) and (ii) 26
COVID-19 convalescent subjects sampled 4-9 weeks after symptom onset (CONV). PBMCs were
stimulated in vitro to induce MBC differentiation into Ab-secreting cells. Antigen-specific

quantitation of MBC-derived Ab (IgG)-secreting cells (MASCs) or MBC-derived polyclonal (IgG)
Abs (MPAbs) provided a measure of the abundance of specific IgG MBCs. (A) IgG MBCs reactive
to the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S), receptor binding domain (RBD), and nucleocapsid (N) in CONV
subjects. MBC numbers were determined by enumeration of IgG MASCs by ELISpot essay after
in vitro MBC stimulation. The assigned cutoff for positivity is shown by the shaded bar. (B) IgG
MBCs reactive to the influenza virus H1 hemagglutinin and TTd in CONV subjects. MBC
numbers were determined by enumeration of IgG MASCs. (C) Proportions of IgG MBCs reactive
to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, S2, and N for individual CONV subjects. (D) Comparison of serum
IgG concentrations (upper panels) and IgG MBC numbers (lower panels) reactive to the SARSCoV-2 S (left-hand side) and N (right-hand side) proteins. Serum IgG was measured by ELISA;
IgG MBC numbers were based on ELISA analysis of MPAbs. Dilution curves are shown for
individual CONV subjects; curves for 4 subjects are shown in different colors to identify particular
response patterns. (E-H) IgG MBCs reactive to the S proteins of HCoVs OC43 (E), and 229E (F),
the H1 hemagglutinin (G), and TTd (H) in CONV and HD subjects. IgG MBC numbers were based
on ELISA measurements of MPAbs. Significance (*, P < 0.05; ns [not significant]) for
comparisons of IgG MBC numbers between subject groups was determined by the Wilcoxon ranksum test.
