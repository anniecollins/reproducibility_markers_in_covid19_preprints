Abstract
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the virus that causes the
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). SARS-CoV-2 encodes three putative ion channels: E, 8a,
and 3a1,2. 3a is expressed in SARS patient tissue and anti-3a antibodies are observed in patient
plasma3-6. 3a has been implicated in viral release7, inhibition of autophagy8, inflammasome
activation9, and cell death10,11 and its deletion reduces viral titer and morbidity in mice1, raising the
possibility that 3a could be an effective vaccine or therapeutic target3,12. Here, we present the first
cryo-EM structures of SARS-CoV-2 3a to 2.1 Å resolution and demonstrate 3a forms an ion
channel in reconstituted liposomes. The structures in lipid nanodiscs reveal 3a dimers and
tetramers adopt a novel fold with a large polar cavity that spans halfway across the membrane
and is accessible to the cytosol and the surrounding bilayer through separate water- and lipidfilled openings. Electrophysiology and fluorescent ion imaging experiments show 3a forms Ca2+permeable non-selective cation channels. We identify point mutations that alter ion permeability
and discover polycationic inhibitors of 3a channel activity. We find 3a-like proteins in multiple
Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus lineages that infect bats and humans. These data show
3a forms a functional ion channel that may promote COVID-19 pathogenesis and suggest
targeting 3a could broadly treat coronavirus diseases.

Main Text
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is an ongoing global
pandemic. Vaccine and therapeutic development are predominantly focused on the essential
virus-encoded Spike, main protease, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase proteins. Highresolution structures of these targets, some in complex with drug candidates or neutralizing
antibodies, have yielded mechanistic insight into their function and have provided a platform for
successful structure-guided vaccine and drug design13-18. Expanding our knowledge of SARSCoV-2 target proteins remains important both for understanding SARS-CoV-2 virology and
developing alternative treatments to mitigate against potential resistance that evolves, or new
viruses that emerge, in the future19.
The SARS-CoV-2 genome encodes three putative ion channels (viroporins)20,21, the envelope
protein (E) and open reading frame (ORF) 3a and 8a1,2. Viroporins have been shown to modify
host membrane permeability to promote viral assembly and release20,22 and SARS-CoV-1 3a has
been reported to form an emodin-sensitive K+-permeable cation channel23,24. 3a is highly
conserved within the Betacoronavirus subgenus Sarbecovirus which includes SARS-CoV-1 and
other related bat coronaviruses (Fig. S1)25. Biopsies from SARS-CoV-1 patients show 3a
expression in infected tissue and SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 patient plasma contain anti-3a
antibodies3-6. SARS-CoV-1 3a has been implicated in inflammasome activation9 and both
apoptotic10 and necrotic cell death11 while SARS-CoV-2 3a has been implicated in apoptosis and
inhibition of autophagy in vitro26. In mouse models of SARS-CoV-1 infection, genomic deletion of
3a reduced viral titer and morbidity1. 3a has therefore been considered a potential target for
vaccines or therapeutics to treat SARS3,12.
Still, the precise roles of 3a in disease pathogenesis are unknown, precluded in part by the lack
of a mechanistic understanding of 3a. Here, we utilize cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM),
electrophysiology, and fluorescent ion flux assays to elucidate 3a protein structure and function.
Structure determination
We determined structures of dimeric and tetrameric SARS-CoV-2 3a in lipid nanodiscs. Full length
SARS-CoV-2 3a was heterologously expressed in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells with a
cleavable C-terminal GFP tag. Purification of 3a in detergent resulted in two species separable
by gel filtration (Fig. S2). A majority of 3a runs at a position consistent with a 62 kDa dimer (Fig.
S2A,C,E) and ~10-30% runs as a 124 kDa tetramer (Fig. S2). A similar degree of tetramer
formation was observed at low concentrations of 3a by fluorescence size-exclusion
chromatography, indicative of a biochemically stable species rather than concentrationdependent nonspecific aggregation (Fig. S2E). These data are consistent with previous reports
of dimeric and tetrameric SARS-CoV-1 3a observed by western blot11,23.
We separately reconstituted dimeric and tetrameric SARS-CoV-2 3a into nanodiscs made from
the scaffold protein MSP1E3D1 and a mixture of DOPE, POPC, and POPS lipids and determined
their structures by cryo-EM to 2.9 Å and 6.5 Å resolution (Fig. 1,2, S2-6). We also determined the
structure of dimeric 3a in the presence of 100uM emodin to 3.7 Å, but observed no significant
structural changes from dimeric apo 3a or any indication of bound emodin (Fig. S7-9). Based on
a recent report of improved resolution for structures of apoferritin and GABAA using new cryo-EM
instrumentation27, we asked whether similar improvements would be possible for the sub-100 kDa
membrane protein 3a. Indeed, a reconstruction generated from data collected on this new
instrumentation, using the same batch of grids, was significantly improved at 2.1 Å (Fig. S10-12).

Unique features of 3a dimers
The 2.9 Å dimeric reconstruction (with C2 symmetry applied, PDB 6XDC) permitted de novo
modeling of 195 of the 275 amino acids per protomer chain. The N-terminus (amino acids 1-39),
C-terminus (amino acids 239-275), and a short cytoplasmic loop (amino acids 175-180) are either
not observed or weakly resolved in the density map due to conformational differences between
particles or because they are disordered (Fig. 1A-E). The 2.1 Å dimeric reconstruction (with C2
symmetry applied, PDB 7KJR) allowed for improved rotamer assignments due to better defined
side chain density throughout the protein, including visible holes in many aromatic residues (Fig.
1F). We additionally were able to model a portion of each MSP1E3D1 scaffold protein (amino
acids 25-55, Fig. 1G,H), two DOPE lipids, and 122 water molecules. A portion of the scaffold
protein is well-resolved largely due to a specific interaction visible on each side of the 3a dimer
(even in C1 reconstructions) between MSP1E3D1 W40 and the transmembrane region of 3a (Fig.
1F,G). The symmetric nature of this interaction means that the two MSPE3D1 protomers must
twist around the lipid bilayer rather than adopting the canonical arrangement of two parallel
stacked rings. We refer to the higher resolution structure unless otherwise indicated.
Surprisingly, 3a adopts a novel fold that, to our knowledge, has not been observed in available
protein structures. Querying the protein structure database for homologs with Dali returned only
weak hits for fragments of 3a domains28. Viewed from the membrane plane, 3a is approximately
70 Å tall with a 40 Å high transmembrane region and a cytosolic domain (CD) extending 30 Å out
of the membrane (Fig. 1A,B). The transmembrane region is composed of three helices per
protomer. 3a is a Class IIIA viroporin22, with N-termini oriented on the extracellular or lumenal side
and C-termini on the cytosolic side of the membrane. Viewed from the extracellular side, the
transmembrane helices (TMs) trace the circumference of an ellipse with TM1-3 from one protomer
followed by TM1-3 of the second protomer in a clockwise order (Fig. 1C). TM1s and TM2s pack
against each other across the elliptical minor axis with TM3s positioned at the major axis vertices.
TM1-TM2 and TM2-TM3 are joined by short intracellular and extracellular linkers, respectively.
The transmembrane region connects to the CD through a turn-helix-turn motif following TM3.
Each protomer chain forms a pair of opposing β-sheets packed against one another in an eight
stranded β-sandwich (Fig. 1B,D). The outer sheet is formed by strands β1, β2, β6 and the Nterminal half of β7. The inner sheet is formed by strands β3, β4, β5, β8, and C-terminal half of β7.
The inner sheets from each protomer interact through a large (~940 Å2 buried surface area per
chain) and highly complementary interface with residues V168, V225, F230, and I232 forming a
continuous hydrophobic core (Fig. 1D). The interaction between β-sandwiches from each
protomer thus forms a strong and stable link between monomers in the dimer.
Structural features of 3a tetramers
We next examined the structure of 3a tetramers. Two-dimensional class averages of tetrameric
3a show a side by side arrangement of two dimers with well-separated TMs and close
juxtaposition of CDs (Fig. 2A). Tetrameric 3a reconstructions had lower final resolutions (~6.5 Å)
than dimeric 3a (Fig. 2A, S6), but were sufficiently featured in the CDs to enable rigid-body
docking of two copies of the 3a dimer (Fig. 2B). The best fit models show that TM3-CTD linkers
and β1-β2 linkers from neighboring dimers form a continuous interface (~300 Å2 buried surface
area per dimer). While the exact positions of side chains cannot be determined at this resolution,
residues W131, R134, K136, H150, T151, N152, C153, and D155 are poised to mediate
tetramerization through a network of hydrophobic, polar, and electrostatic interactions (Fig. 2C).
In SARS-CoV-1 3a, reducing agents and a C133A mutation resulted in loss of oligomerization,
membrane localization, and channel activity23. However, expression of the C133A mutant was

dramatically reduced, suggesting these results may be a consequence of protein destabilization23.
In SARS-CoV-2 3a, C133 is located in a notable cysteine-rich pocket adjacent to the
tetramerization interface (Fig. S13). At the base of TM3, C133 projects back towards the top faces
of β1 and β2 in close proximity to solvent exposed C148 and buried C157. All three cysteines are
reduced in the structure, though they are within potential disulfide-bonding distance (Cα distance
4.4-6.5 Å) (Fig. S13). While it is unlikely a disulfide involving C133 mediates tetramerization of 3a
without significant rearrangement of this region, it may be that disruption of this cysteine-rich
pocket with cysteine modifying agents or mutations disfavors 3a oligomerization allosterically.
Ion permeation through 3a
Ion conduction pathways are key determinants of ion channel function. Examination of the 3a
structure for possible conduction pathways shows a hydrophobic seal in the extracellular half of
the transmembrane region above a large polar cavity (Fig. 3). The hydrophobic seal is formed by
interactions between transmembrane helices and includes residues F43, L46, I47, V50, L95, and
L96 (Fig. 3A-C). Just cytoplasmic to the hydrophobic constriction, the top of the channel cavity is
formed by polar interactions between Q57, S58, N82, and Q116 side chains (Fig. 3A,D).
While we do not observe a continuous permeation pathway across the membrane, there is a large
polar cavity within the inner half of the TM region. The cavity is continuous with the cytosol and
surrounding bilayer through three pairs of openings: the intersubunit, upper, and lower tunnels
(Fig. 3E-I). The intersubunit tunnels run between TM1 and TM3 from opposing protomers, just
above the CD, and open to the membrane-cytosol interface (Fig. 3E). Strong lipid-shaped density
present within each intersubunit tunnel is modeled as DOPE (the most abundant lipid in these
nanodiscs) with the ethanolamine head group pointed into the cavity. Lipid binding is stabilized
by electrostatic interactions: the positively charged ethanolamine interacts with negatively
charged D142 and the backbone carbonyls of I63 and D142 while the lipid phosphate interacts
with R126, R122, Y206, N144, and the backbone amide of L65. The upper tunnels are formed
between TM2 and TM3 within each protomer, narrow to ~2.2 Å in radius, and likely open to the
membrane (Fig. 3F,G). The lower tunnels run underneath the TM1-TM2 linker and above the CD,
narrow to ~2 Å in radius, and open to the cytosol (Fig. 3H,I). The lower tunnels are open paths
for ion and water movement between the cell interior and channel cavity. Consistently, a network
of ordered water molecules extends through these openings, the cavity, and the CD (Fig. 3F,H).
Together, these features are consistent with the 3a structure representing a closed or inactivated
channel.
Biophysical properties of reconstituted 3a ion channels
We next utilized electrophysiology and calcium imaging to determine whether reconstituted 3a
proteins are capable of permeating ions. We purified 3a in detergent, reconstituted it into
phosphatidylcholine-containing proteoliposomes, and recorded currents across excised patches
pulled from proteoliposome blisters. Excised patches from 3a-containing liposomes exhibited
currents that reversed at 0 mV and displayed modest outward rectification in symmetric [K+],
consistent with preferential sidedness of rectifying channels in the membrane after reconstitution
(Fig. 4A). In contrast, channel-like activity was not observed in recordings from mockreconstituted (empty) proteoliposomes (Fig. S15G). We evaluated ion selectivity of 3a by
replacing the K+-containing bath solution with solutions containing Na+, NMDG+, or Ca2+. Solution
exchange resulted in reversal potential shifts from 0.3 ± 0.3 mV in K+ to -8.2 ± 0.8 mV in Ca2+, 13.5 ± 1.8 mV in Na+, and -31.0 ± 1.1 mV in NMDG+ (Fig. 4B,D). These shifts correspond to the
following permeability ratios (PX/PK+): Ca2+ (1.88±0.08) > K+ (1.0±0.01) > Na+ (0.59±0.04) >
NMDG+ (0.29±0.01) (Fig. 4C). Alkaline or acidic pH had little effect on channel activity (Fig. S15F).

Using Fluo-5N calcium imaging, we also observed significant calcium influx in 3a-proteoliposomes
following the addition of 8mM [Ca2+]ext compared to empty liposomes. Overall, these results
suggest that SARS-CoV-2 3a is a Ca2+-permeable nonselective cation channel.
Polycations block 3a channel activity
We next asked whether known blockers of non-selective cation channels also inhibit 3a ion
conduction. We found that Ruthenium Red (RuR), a 786 Da polycationic dye, blocks 3a activity
in current recordings (Fig. 4G-H) and Ca2+ influx measurements (Fig. 4H-I). RuR displays dosedependent inhibition of 3a activity in proteoliposome recordings (IC50=90 ± 10 µM) with flickery
block at negative potentials, similar to that observed with other large pore channels (Fig. 4G). In
addition, we identified the polyamine spermidine, which showed near complete block at 10 mM,
and the trivalent ions Gd3+, Fe3+, and Tb3+, which showed partial block at 1-10 mM, as 3a inhibitors
in proteoliposome recordings (Fig. 4G). RuR, spermidine, Gd3+, and other trivalents are relatively
nonselective inhibitors of cation channels including TRPs, RyRs, CALHMs, K2Ps, and KIRs29-35.
SARS-CoV-2 3a activity was not inhibited by Ba2+ or the small molecule emodin (Fig. S15D,E),
two reported inhibitors of SARS-CoV-1 3a23,24. This is consistent with our finding that the addition
of emodin had no effect on SARS-CoV-2 3a structure (Fig. S7-9).
3a permeates the large divalent ion YO-PRO-1
Given the ability of 3a channels to conduct NMDG+ (Fig. 4A-D), we next used a YO-PRO-1
fluorescence-based flux assay to assess the ability of 3a channels to conduct other large cations.
YO-PRO-1, a 629 Da divalent cation, does not readily cross lipid bilayers and has been used to
study the activity of other non-selective cation channels, including P2X7 and TRP channels, that
conduct large organic cations29,30,36,37. Robust YO-PRO-1 uptake was observed in a subset of 3a
liposomes that was significantly higher than background fluorescence observed in empty
liposomes (Fig. 5A-D). To compare YO-PRO-1 uptake across multiple experiments, we quantified
a single value (area under the curve) to represent both the number of YO-PRO-1+ liposomes and
the amount of YO-PRO-1 uptake (Fig. 5E). Using this analysis, we found 3a-liposomes display
significantly greater YO-PRO-1 uptake and accumulation as compared to empty liposomes (Fig.
5E). Uptake was dependent on 3a protein because liposomes containing the human K2P channel
TRAAK displayed little uptake and accumulation of YO-PRO-1, similar to empty liposomes, as
expected for a highly selective K+ channel (Fig. 5A, C-E). Similar to current recordings (Fig. 4EF), we observed a dose-dependent RuR block of 3a activity in the YO-PRO-1 flux assay (IC50=175
± 98 µM). These data demonstrate that 3a can form an ion channel that is capable of passing
large cations. RuR (786 Da) block and YO-PRO-1 (629 Da) and NMDG+ (406 Da) permeation
sets limits on 3a pore size that are similar those observed for TRP and P2X channels.
3a mutants alter channel activity
We speculate that an open conformation of 3a involves substantial rearrangement of the
hydrophobic seal to create a central pore through the membrane or more subtle rearrangement
of the partially hydrophilic membrane facing sides of TM2 and TM3 to create membrane facing
conduction pathways. To probe the structural determinants for 3a ion conduction, we set out to
identify 3a mutations that alter channel activity. To this end, we purified nine mutated or truncated
3a constructs, reconstituted each into proteoliposomes, and compared them to wild-type 3a in
electrophysiological recordings (Fig. 6A, S16). Consistent with our hypothesis that 3a channel
opening would likely require conformational changes in transmembrane helices to expand the
constrictions above the polar cavity to the extracellular side, we find that two separate mutants at
the top of the cavity (Q57E and S58L/Q116L) alter channel activity. Both Q57E and S58L/Q116L

mutants reduce Ca2+ and NMDG+ permeability, but did not alter Na+ or K+ permeability. These
effects were specific to these mutations as seven additional mutations, including a common
circulating variant Q57H38, had no effect on relative ion permeability.
Our structural analysis revealed an unassigned region of density in the cryo-EM maps stretching
between subunits just above the extracellular side of the transmembrane region that likely
corresponds to a portion of the unmodeled N-terminus (Fig. S14). To investigate the potential role
of the N-terminus in channel function, we generated an N-terminal deletion construct lacking the
first 41 amino acids (3aΔN). This mutant displayed reduced Ca2+ and NMDG+ relative permeability
in proteoliposome recordings, albeit to a lesser extent than Q57E and S58L/Q116L (Figure 6B).
Changes in permeability may reflect changes in pore properties or altered cellular localization.
The relative permeability changes observed in liposomes combined with the observation that
3aΔN channels localize to the plasma membrane (Fig. S14) suggest that the N-terminus mediates
the ability of 3a to permeate large cations.
3a-like proteins in Alpha- and Beta-coronavirus
While 3a is well conserved in the Betacoronavirus subgenus (Fig. S1), related proteins have not
yet been identified in other coronaviruses, including the other five species known to infect
humans: MERS-CoV, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-OC43. Thus, we asked
whether we could identify more distant homologs using the 3a structure and structure prediction
algorithms. 3a homologs were not detected in Gammacoronavirus, Deltacoronavirus, or in the
Betacoronavirus subgenus Embecovirus (which includes HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43). Distant
homology to the CD was identified in the membrane protein ORF5 found in Betacoronavirus
subgenus Merbecovirus species including MERS-CoV. However, we identified high confidence
structural homologs in all remaining Betacoronavirus and Alphacoronavirus subgenera (including
in HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 (Fig. S17)), several of which have been reported to have ion
channel activity39-41. Notably, coronaviruses with 3a homologs have been proposed to derive from
viruses that circulate primarily in bats, while coronaviruses without 3a structural homologs have
been proposed to derive from viruses that circulate primarily in rodents, birds, or pigs (Table 2).
Perhaps the presence of 3a in coronaviruses with bats as their principal reservoir reflects a unique
aspect of bat coronavirus biology.
Overall, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 3a forms a non-selective Ca2+ permeable cation
channel when reconstituted in liposomes. 3a structures show a novel fold with a polar cytoplasmic
cavity open to the cytosol and membrane below a hydrophobic seal, consistent with a closed or
inhibited state. The basis for 3a channel gating and conduction remains to be determined. SARSCoV-2 3a channels display permeability to large cations including NMDG+ and YO-PRO-1 and
sensitivity to RuR and Gd3+, reminiscent of other Ca2+-permeable channels including TRPV1,
TRPA1, and P2X729,30. Channel activity may be important for promoting viral maturation in cells
through inhibition of autophagy and disruption of lysosomes7,8. The calcium permeability of 3a is
of particular interest in the context of infection. SARS-CoV-2 3a has been recently shown to trigger
programmed cell death in vitro26 and calcium-influx through 3a may be the switch that activates
calcium-dependent caspases and apoptosis. Previous studies showed SARS-CoV-1 3a channel
expression in infected lung pneumocytes, a key cell type also infected by SARS-CoV-2, and
calcium signaling in type II pneumocytes plays an important role in maintaining airway
homeostasis42,43. Thus, the expression of a calcium permeable channel, like SARS-CoV-2 3a,
could impact lung homeostasis and COVID-19 pathogenesis. Our data suggest that 3a may
represent a new target for treating COVID-19 and other coronavirus diseases and points the way
to future experiments that will elucidate the role of 3a in the viral life cycle and disease pathology.

Methods
Cloning and protein expression
The coding sequence for the 3a protein from SARS-Cov-2 was codon optimized for Spodoptera
frugiperda (Sf9 cells) and synthesized (IDT, Newark, NJ). The sequence was then cloned into a
custom
vector
based
on
the
pACEBAC1
backbone
(MultiBac;
Geneva
Biotech, Geneva, Switzerland) with an added C-terminal PreScission protease (PPX) cleavage
site, linker sequence, superfolder GFP (sfGFP) and 7xHis tag, generating a construct for
expression of 3a-SNS-LEVLFQGP-SRGGSGAAAGSGSGS-sfGFP-GSS-7xHis. Mutants and
truncation were also introduced into this construct using PCR. MultiBac cells were used to
generate a Bacmid according to manufacturer’s instructions. Sf9 cells were cultured in ESF 921
medium (Expression Systems, Davis, CA) and P1 virus was generated from cells transfected with
Escort IV reagent (MillaporeSigma, Burlington, MA) according to manufacturer’s instructions. P2
virus was then generated by infecting cells at 2 million cells/mL with P1 virus at a MOI ~0.1, with
infection monitored by fluorescence and harvested at 72 hours. P3 virus was generated in a
similar manner to expand the viral stock. The P2 or P3 viral stock was then used to infect Sf9
cells at 4 million cells/mL at a MOI ~2–5. At 72 hours, infected cells containing expressed 3asfGFP protein were harvested by centrifugation at 2500 x g for 10 minutes and frozen at -80°C.
Protein purification
For preparation of the 3a dimer and mutant constructs, infected Sf9 cells from 1 L of culture (~1520 mL of cell pellet) were thawed in 100 mL of Lysis Buffer containing 50 mM Tris, 150 mM KCl,
1mM EDTA pH 8. Protease inhibitors (Final Concentrations: E64 (1 µM), Pepstatin A (1 µg/mL),
Soy Trypsin Inhibitor (10 µg/mL), Benzamidine (1 mM), Aprotinin (1 µg/mL), Leupeptin (1µg/mL),
AEBSF (1mM), and PMSF (1mM)) were added to the lysis buffer immediately before use.
Benzonase (4 µl) was added after the cell pellet thawed. Cells were then lysed by sonication and
centrifuged at 150,000 x g for 45 minutes. The supernatant was discarded and residual nucleic
acid was removed from the top of the membrane pellet using DPBS. Membrane pellets were
scooped into a dounce homogenizer containing Extraction Buffer (50 mM Tris, 150 mM KCl, 1
mM EDTA, 1% n-Dodecyl-β-D-Maltopyranoside (DDM, Anatrace, Maumee, OH), pH 8). A 10%
stock solution of DDM was dissolved and clarified by bath sonication in 200 mM Tris pH 8 prior to
addition to buffer to the indicated final concentration. Membrane pellets were then homogenized
in Extraction Buffer and this mixture (150 mL final volume) was gently stirred at 4°C for 1 hour.
The extraction mixture was centrifuged at 33,000 x g for 45 minutes and the supernatant,
containing solubilized membrane protein, was bound to 4 mL of Sepharose resin coupled to antiGFP nanobody for 1 hour at 4°C. The resin was then collected in a column and washed with 10
mL of Buffer 1 (20 mM HEPES, 150 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.025% DDM, pH 7.4), 40 mL of Buffer
2 (20 mM HEPES, 500 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.025% DDM, pH 7.4), and 10 mL of Buffer 1. The
resin was then resuspended in 6 mL of Buffer 1 with 0.5 mg of PPX protease and rocked gently
in the capped column for 2 hours. Cleaved 3a protein was then eluted with an additional 8 mL of
Wash Buffer, spin concentrated to ~500 µl with Amicon Ultra spin concentrator 10 kDa cutoff
(Millipore), and then loaded onto a Superdex 200 increase column (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL)
on an NGC system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) equilibrated in Buffer 1. Peak fractions containing 3a
channel were then collected and spin concentrated prior to incorporation into proteoliposomes or
nanodiscs. For the tetramer, the preparation was carried out in a similar manner, except with
overnight protease cleavage and collection of a peak of larger hydrodynamic radius (see Fig. S3).

Proteoliposome formation
For proteoliposome patching experiments, we incorporated protein into lipid and generated
proteoliposome blisters for patch recordings using dehydration and rehydration as described
previously with the following modifications44. 3a dimer was first purified into Buffer 1. Protein was
then exchanged into lipid with the addition of Biobeads SM2 (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and an
overnight incubation at a protein:lipid ratio of 1:10 (corresponding to 0.5 mg purified 3a dimer and
5 mg of cleared Soybean L-α-phosphatidylcholine (Soy PC, MillaporeSigma, Burlington, MA) in
DR Buffer (5 mM HEPES, 200 mM KCl, pH7.2). For the YO-PRO-1 assay, 3a was incorporated
at a ratio of 1:50. TRAAK control proteoliposomes were prepared at 1:50 as described
previously44. Control liposomes were prepared from the same lipid mix and protocol with protein
replaced with Buffer 1.
Electrophysiology
All electrophysiology recordings were made from 3a-reconstituted Soy PC proteoliposomes.
Patches formed in an inside-out configuration and were quickly (within 5-10 seconds) transferred
to a solution exchange chamber. Recordings were made at room temperature using Clampex
10.7 data acquisition software with an Axopatch 200B Patch Clamp amplifier and Digidata 1550B
digitizer (Molecular Devices) at a bandwidth of 1 kHz and digitized at 500 kHz. A pressure clamp
(ALA Scientific) was used to form seals. Potassium pipette and bath solution was 5 mM HEPES
pH 7.2, 150 mM KCl. Sodium bath solution was 5 mM HEPES pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl. NaCl in the
bath solution was substituted for 150 mM NMDG-Cl or 75 mM CaCl2 for permeability experiments.
Borosilicate glass pipettes were pulled and polished to a resistance of 2-5 MΩ when filled with
pipette solution. For cation permeability experiments, liquid junction potentials were calculated
and data were corrected offline. For current-voltage plots, the following voltage protocol was
applied: Vhold= 0 mV mV; Vtest= -100 to +100 mV, Δ20 mV, ttest = 1 second. Currents from each
patch correspond to mean values during the step to the indicated voltage.
Permeability ratios were calculated according to Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz relationship. For
monovalent cations, permeability ratios were calculated as PX+/PK+ = exp(ΔVrevF/RT). For divalent
cations, permeability ratios were calculated as: PX2+/PK+ = 𝛼K+[K+]exp(ΔVrevF/RT)(1 +
exp(ΔVrevF/RT))/ 4𝛼X2+[X2+] where Vrev is the reversal potential, F is Faraday's constant, R is the
universal gas constant, and T is absolute temperature (where RT/F = 25.2 mV at room
temperature), and 𝛼 is the ion activity coefficient (assumed to be 0.75 for K+ and 0.25 for Ca2+).
Ca2+ uptake assay in proteoliposomes
Fluo-5N was incorporated into 3a-reconstituted proteoliposomes and control liposomes by first
thawing frozen liposomes at a ratio of ~1:20 (v:v) into modified sucrose formation buffer45 25 mM
HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM KCl, and 262 mM Sucrose with a final concentration of 25 uM Fluo-5N
(Stock concentration 5 mM in DMSO, AAT Bioquest). Next, the liposome mixtures in Eppendorf
tubes were placed in a foam flotation in an ice bath and sonicated with a Branson Digital Sonifier
450 for 30 seconds total (10% Amplitude, 10 second pulse with 59 second wait time). Excess
(unincorporated) Fluo-5N was then removed using microspin G-50 columns (Cytiva). The sample
was then diluted into solution containing 50mM HEPES, 300mM KCl, and 2mM EGTA, pH=7.4
and plated onto poly-D-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich, 1mg/ml) coated 96-well plates, and centrifuged
(5,000 x g for 5 min) at room temperature. Ca2+ influx was measured upon addition of a 50 mM
HEPES, 285 mM KCl, 10 mM CaCl2, pH=7.4 solution. Images were acquired every 3 seconds for
a total of 150 seconds. Fluorescence intensity of each liposome was normalized to its average
fluorescence prior to Ca2+ addition.

YO-PRO-1 flux assay
Liposomes were diluted in saline solution containing 300mM KCl, 50mM HEPES, pH=7.4 and
plated onto poly-D-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich, 1mg/ml) coated 96-well plates, centrifuged (5,000 x g
for 5 min) and incubated in 10μM YO-PRO-1 iodide (Invitrogen) for 10 min at room temperature.
Liposomes were rinsed with saline solution to remove free YO-PRO-1. Images were acquired
using an ImageXpress Micro XLS microscope with a solid-state light source and 20X air objective.
Images were analyzed using MetaXpress 6 software (Molecular Devices). Empty liposomes
displayed low-level fluorescence in the 488/540nm range. Thus, liposomes were defined as YOPRO-1+ if their fluorescence intensity was above the average intensity of unlabeled, empty
liposomes. To calculate the total number of liposomes, we quantified the total number of
liposomes using auto segmentation on MetaXpress 6 from brightfield images. Stock solutions of
Ruthenium red (Tocris) were prepared in water, diluted in bath solution and applied to liposomes
or cells 10min before the start of the experiment. All statistical tests were performed using Prism
(GraphPad). Values are reported as the mean ± SD or mean ± SEM as indicated. Mann Whitney
or a one-way or Welch’s ANOVA followed by the Dunnett’s, Sidak’s, or Tukey’s post hoc tests
(where appropriate) were used for statistical comparisons.
Nanodisc Formation
Freshly purified 3a dimer in Buffer 1 was reconstituted into MSP1E3D1 nanodiscs with a mixture
of lipids (DOPE:POPS:POPC at a 2:1:1 mass ratio, Avanti, Alabaster, Alabama) at a final molar
ratio of 1:4:400 (Monomer Ratio: 3a, MSP1E3D1, lipid mixture). First, 20 mM solubilized lipid in
Nanodisc Formation Buffer (20 mM HEPES, 150 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA pH 7.4) was mixed with
additional DDM detergent and 3a protein. This solution was mixed at 4°C for 30 minutes before
addition of purified MSP1E3D1. This addition brought the final concentrations to approximately
15 µM 3a, 60 µM MSP1E3D1, 6 mM lipid mix, and 10 mM DDM in Nanodisc Formation Buffer.
The solution with MSP1E3D1 was mixed at 4°C for 10 minutes before addition of 200 mg of
Biobeads SM2. Biobeads (washed into methanol, water, and then Nanodisc Formation Buffer)
were weighed after liquid was removed by pipetting (damp weight). This mix was incubated at
4°C for 30 minutes before addition of another 200 mg of Biobeads (for a total 400 mg of Biobeads
per 0.5 mL reaction). This final mixture was then gently tumbled at 4°C overnight (~ 12 hours).
Supernatant was cleared of beads by letting large beads settle and carefully removing liquid with
a pipette. Sample was spun for 10 minutes at 21,000 x g before loading onto a Superdex 200
increase column in 20 mM HEPES, 150 mM KCl, pH 7.4. Peak fractions corresponding to 3a
protein in MSP1E3D1 were collected, 10 kDa cutoff spin concentrated and used for grid
preparation. MSP1E3D1 was prepared as described46 without cleavage of the His-tag. Tetrameric
3a in nanodiscs was prepared similarly, except with a ratio of 1:2:200 (Monomer Ratio: 3a,
MSP1E3D1, lipid mixture).
Grid Preparation
Dimeric 3a in MSP1E3D1 was prepared at final concentration of 1.1 mg/mL. For the sample with
emodin (MillaporeSigma, Burlington, MA, Catalog# E7881), a stock solution of 50 mM emodin in
DMSO added to protein sample for final concentrations of 1.1 mg/mL 3a and 100 µM emodin and
1% DMSO. Concentrated sample was cleared by a 10 minute 21,000 x g spin at 4ºC prior to grid
making. For freezing grids, a 3 µl drop of protein was applied to freshly glow discharged Holey
Carbon, 300 mesh R 1.2/1.3 gold grids (Quantifoil, Großlöbichau, Germany). A FEI Vitrobot Mark
IV (ThermoFisher Scientific) was used with 4°C, 100% humidity, 1 blot force, a wait time of ~5
seconds, and a 3 second blot time, before plunge freezing in liquid ethane. Grids were then
clipped and used for data collection. Tetrameric 3a in MSP1E3D1 was frozen at 0.7 mg/mL with

the same grid preparation. Unimaged grids from the same session were then shipped to the
Netherlands for data collection on the 300 kV microscope with Falcon 4/CFEG/Selectris energy
filter.
Cryo-EM data acquisition
For data collected on the Talos Arctica, grids were clipped and transferred to the microscope
operated at 200 kV. Fifty frame movies were recorded on a Gatan K3 Summit direct electron
detector in super-resolution counting mode with pixel size of 0.5685 Å. For the apo 3a dataset,
the electron dose was 9.528 e- Å2 s-1 and 10.135 e- Å2 s- and total dose was 50.02 e- Å2 and 53.72
e- Å2 in the first set (1-2007) and second set (2008-6309) of movies respectively. The two different
doses are the result of needing to restart the electron gun during collection. For the 3a with added
emodin dataset, the electron dose was 8.991 e- Å2 s- 1 and total dose was 47.21 e- Å2. For the 3a
tetramer, the electron dose was 8.841 e- Å2 s- 1 and total dose was 49.95 e- Å2. Nine movies were
collected around a central hole position with image shift and defocus was varied from −0.6 to −2.0
µm through SerialEM47.
For data collected for the high resolution 3a dimer structure, clipped grids from the same batch
used on Talos Artica were sent to Thermo Fisher Scientific RnD division in Eindhoven, The
Netherlands. Grids were loaded onto the Krios G4 microscope equipped Cold Field Emission gun
(CFEG) operated at 300 kV. Data were collected on a Falcon 4 detector that was mounted behind
a Selectris X energy filter. The slit width of the energy filter was set to 10eV. 5599 movie stacks
containing 1429 raw frames were collected with EER (electron event representation) mode48 of
Falcon 4 detector at a magnification of 165 kX corresponding to a pixel size of 0.727 Å. Each
movie stack was recorded with an exposure time of 6s with a total dose of 50e/A2 on sample and
a defocus range between 0.5 to 1.2 µm.
See Table 1 for detailed data collection statistics.
Cryo-EM data processing
For the apo 3a dimer, motion-correction and dose-weighting were performed on all 6,309 movies
using RELION 3.1’s implementation of MotionCor2, and 2x “binned” to 1.137 Å per pixel49-51.
CTFFIND-4.1 was used to estimate the contrast transfer function (CTF) parameters52.
Micrographs were then manually sorted to eliminate subjectively bad micrographs, such as empty
or contaminated holes, resulting in 3,611 good micrographs. Additionally, micrographs with a CTF
maximum resolution lower than 4 Å were discarded, resulting in 2,595 remaining micrographs.
Template-free auto-picking of particles was performed with RELION3.1’s Laplacian-of-Gaussian
(LoG) filter yielding an initial set of particles. This initial set of particles were iteratively classified
to generate templates, which were subsequently used to template-based auto-pick 1,750,730
particles.
Template picked particles were iteratively 2D-classified in RELION3.1 and then in cryoSPARC
v253, resulting in 820,543 particles. These particles were subsequently 3D-classified in
cryoSPARC v2 with iterative ab-initio and heterogeneous refinement jobs. The resulting maps
were visually evaluated with regard to the transmembrane domain density. A set of 86,479
particles were identified, polished in RELION3.1 and refined in cryoSPARC v2 with subsequent
homogeneous and non-uniform refinement54 jobs (maps were low-pass filtered to an initial
resolution where TM density was still visible (6-9 Å), and the dynamic mask was tightened with
the near (2-5 Å) and far (3-9 Å) parameters), yielding a map with overall resolution of 3.6 Å. UCSF
pyem tools were used to convert data from cryoSPARC to RELION format55.

From this set of 86,479 particles, 2D-classification was performed in RELION3.1 to identify a set
of particles with subjectively equal view distribution. From the resulting set, 1,000 particles were
randomly sampled and their coordinates used for training in the Topaz particle-picking pipeline56.
Training, picking, and extraction were performed independently on each subset of the
micrographs. 4,134,279 total particles were extracted in RELION3.1 with a box size of 256 pixels
and “binned” 4x to 4.548 Å/pixel. These particles were then iteratively 2D-classified in RELION3.1
resulting in 2,674,606 particles which were extracted at 2.274 Å/pixel. 2D-classification was
continued in both RELION3.1 and cryoSPARC v2 resulting in 1,429,763 particles. Further
classification was performed in cryoSPARC v2 with subsequent ab-initio (4 classes, max
resolution 8 Å) and heterogeneous refinement (8 Å initial resolution) jobs. The two best classes
were selected and the particles pooled resulting in 743,800 particles which were extracted in
RELION3.1 at 1.137 Å/pixel.
Iterative 3D-classification was performed with subsequent ab-initio and heterogeneous
refinement jobs as described above. Following each round, 2D classification jobs were used to
“rescue” good particles from the worst classes before the next round. After 3 rounds, a final 2Dclassificaiton job was used to identify 112,502 particles, which were subsequently pooled with the
previous 86,479 RELION3.1 template-picked particles, resulting in 185,871 particles after
duplicates (within 100 Å) were removed with RELION3.1.
These particles were then refined with subsequent homogeneous and non-uniform refinement
jobs resulting in a map with overall resolution of 3.4 Å. This map was post-processed in
RELION3.1 using a mask with a soft edge (5 pixel extension, 7 pixel soft-edge), the output of
which was used for Bayesian particle polishing in RELION3.1 (training and polishing were each
performed independently on each subset of the micrographs). The resulting “shiny” particles were
then refined in cryoSPARC v2 with subsequent homogenous refinement (1 extra pass, 7 Å initial
resolution) and non-uniform refinement (C2, 1 extra pass, 9 Å initial resolution) to yield a map with
2.9 Å overall resolution.
For 3a dimer with added 100 µM emodin, initial processing was similar to the dimer without added
drug (see Fig. S8). As with the apo 3a dimer, the critical steps included Topaz particle picking,
particle clean-up with cryoSPARC v2 ab-initio and heterogeneous refinement, non-uniform
refinement with tightened masking, and RELION3.1 Bayesian particle polishing. However, in
contrast to the apo dataset, we observed a set of particles that were included in < 4 Å
reconstructions that had discontinuous transmembrane domain density. Removal of these
particles with RELION3.1 3D classification without angular sampling led to the best map from the
emodin-added dataset. We did not see any evidence of bound emodin, but the 1% DMSO added
with drug addition may have contributed to subtle map differences (Fig. S8,S9).
For the 3a tetramer, the initial 7,092 micrographs were first cleaned using manual inspection and
removal of images with < 4 Å CtfMaxResolution to obtain a set of 4,324 micrographs. Reference
particles for Topaz particle picking were generated by first template picking in RELION3.1,
followed by 2D classification in both RELION3.1 and cryoSPARC v2, and subsequent ab-initio in
cryoSPARC v2. Particles from various views were then selected from iterative RELION3.1 2D
classification to create a set of 6,843 particles. Using these coordinates for training, Topaz particle
picking was then performed to generate a set of 1,282,913 initial particles. These particles were
then cleaned using 2D classification in RELION3.1 and cryoSPARC v2, followed by rounds of
cryoSPARC v2 ab-initio and RELION3.1 3D classification. A major hurdle for tetramer processing
was obtaining a reconstruction where most particles were properly oriented in the same direction
(i.e. ICD domains on the same side of the nanodisc as seen in the 2D classes, see Fig. 2F).

Substantial, cleanup by 3D-classification was needed to generate a correctly aligned reference
map, but this map could then be used as a reference for refinements and classification for larger
particle sets. Reconstructions with C1 or C2 symmetry looked similar (see Fig. S10), although no
tetramer reconstruction went to high enough resolution to determine symmetry with certainty.
Therefore, it is possible that either the tetramer is pseudosymmetric or that different particles have
heterogeneous orientations between dimer pairs. For the tetramer, the highest resolution
reconstruction came from cryoSPARC v2 non-uniform refinement with a tightened mask, which
was subsequently used for dimer-docking and figure preparation.
For the apo 3a dimer imaged on a Krios with CFEG, Selectris X, and Falcon 4, the EER movie
motion correction and subsequent polishing was performed in RELION3.1 using the devel-eer
branch of Relion. Dose fractions consisting of 30 frames corresponding to 1.035e/A2 per fraction
were created. The initial 5599 micrographs were pruned by selecting 4495 micrographs with <
3.5 Å CtfMaxResolution that also passed manual inspection. Similarly to the Arctica datasets, an
initial set of particles was generated with template based picking and subsequent 2D
classification, Ab initio, and Heterogeneous refinement for clean-up was performed in cryoSPARC
v2 (See Fig. S11). This particle set (44,944) was then used as training for the first round of Topaz
particle picking. For initial particle clean-up, the most important step was heterogeneous
refinement in cryoSPARC v2, yielding a particle set (215,227) that gave a C2 non-uniform
refinement at 2.69 Å. For final particle clean-up, using RELION3.1, polished particles were
subjected to 3D classification with no angular sampling and high tau (40) during which we
monitored the rounds of classification by looking for convergence in resolution and inspecting
maps to check for quality of protein features or noise. This type of job reliably allowed us to select
the best particles (61,531) for high-resolution reconstruction at 2.26 Å.
At this point, a second Topaz training and picking round was conducted using this set of particles.
After merging the best particles from both rounds of Topaz picking, removing potential duplicate
particles within a distance of 100 Å, and subsequent processing, we obtained a set of particles
(91,218) that achieved a non-uniform reconstruction at 2.17 Å. Finally, rounds of CtfRefine in
cryoSPARC v2 and a final non-uniform refinement (with higher-order CTF terms enabled)
achieved a map with an estimated resolution of 2.1 Å. Depending on inputs into sharpening and
local resolution jobs (Fig. S12A), the map has regions that give resolution estimates significantly
below 2 Å, consistent with our observations of holes in aromatic side chain density.
We note that the merging of two Topaz picked particle sets likely allowed us to break a particlelimited barrier to achieve the final reconstruction based on ResLog57 analysis performed in
cryoSPARC (See Fig. S12C). Finally, we sampled various box sizes during processing (as large
as 416 pixels and as small as 256 pixels)58. The best reconstructions were consistently achieved
with our final box size of 300 pixels (218.1 Å).
Modeling, Refinement, and Analysis
Apo dimeric 3a cryo-EM maps were sharpened using cryoSPARC and were of sufficient quality
for de novo model building in Coot59. Real space refinement of the models was carried out using
Phenix.real_space_refine60. Molprobity61 was used to evaluate the stereochemistry and geometry
of the structure for subsequent rounds of manual adjustment in Coot and refinement in Phenix.
For final sharpening and visualization of the high-resolution map we used Phenix Resolve Density
Modification62. Docking of the apo dimeric 3a into the tetrameric 3a cryo-EM map was performed
in Phenix using a map in which large empty regions of the nanodisc were erased in Chimera63.
Similar results were found using maps with only the CDs present. Cavity measurements were
made with HOLE64 implemented in Coot. Comparisons to the structure database was performed

Figure S1 – Sequence alignment of 3a from Betacoronavirus Sarbecovirus
(A) Alignment of fifteen 3a protein sequences colored by conservation in a ramp from white (not
conserved) to dark blue (highly conserved). Accession numbers are indicated. Sequences were selected
to maximize diversity among annotated Sarbecovirus 3a proteins. Secondary structure for SARS-CoV-2 is
drawn above the sequence with unmodeled sequence drawn as dashed lines. (B) Neighbor-joining tree
calculated from the alignment in (A).

Figure S16 – Purification and liposome reconstitution of 3a mutants and truncation
Top: GFP fluorescence chromatogram (FSEC) of 3a, as well as indicated mutants and truncations,
expressed in SF9 cells and extracted in DDM detergent. Samples were run on a Superose 6 column. For
all other panels: Size exclusion chromatogram from a s200 column of indicated 3a constructs expressed in
insect cells and extracted and purified in DDM (left), coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE of pooled dimeric 3a
construct -containing fractions (center), and of 3a following reconstitution into PC lipids (right).

Figure S17 - Sequence alignment of 3a-like proteins across Coronaviridae
(A) Alignment of twenty-eight 3a-like protein sequences colored by conservation in a ramp from white (not
conserved) to dark blue (highly conserved). Accession numbers are listed in Table 2. Sequences were
selected from representative species from each Coronavirus subgenus. Alphacoronavirus and
Betacoronavirus clades are indicated. Within Betacoronavirus the subgenus Merbecovirus is also indicated
with a bar. (B) Neighbor-joining tree calculated from the alignment in (A).
