Abstract

19

Healthcare professionals are at higher risk of contracting the novel coronavirus due to their work

20

exposure in the healthcare settings. Practicing appropriate preventive measures to control COVID-

21

19 infection is one of the most important interventions that healthcare workers are expected to use.

22

The aim of this study was to assess the level of risk perception and practices of preventive measures

23

of COVID-19 among health workers in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. A hospital-based cross-sectional

24

study was conducted from 9th to 26th June 2020 among healthcare professionals working at six

25

public hospitals in Addis Ababa. Data were collected using a self-administered structured

26

questionnaire. Frequency, percentage, and mean were used to summarize the data. A binary

27

logistic regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with risk perception

28

about COVID-19. A total of 1,134 participants were surveyed. Wearing facemask (93%), hand

29

washing for at least 20 seconds (93%), covering mouth and nose while coughing or sneezing

30

(91%), and avoiding touching eyes, nose, and mouth (91%) were the commonly self-reported

31

preventive practices. About 88% perceived that they were worried about the risk of becoming

32

infected with coronavirus, and majority (91%) worried about the risk of infection to their family.

33

The mean score of overall fear and worry of COVID-19 was 2.37 on a scale of 1 to 3. Respondents

34

who ever provided clinical care to COVID-19 patients were more likely to report fear and worry

35

(adjusted OR=1.34, 95% CI:1.02-1.91), however those who ever participated in Ebola or SARS

36

outbreaks were less likely to report fear and worry due to COVID-19 crisis (adjusted OR=0.66,

37

95% CI:0.48-0.90). This study has revealed widespread practices of preventive measures and the

38

highest perceived risk of COVID-19 among healthcare workers. Therefore, an effective risk

39

communication intervention should be implemented to ensure the maintenance of appropriate

40

practices during the current COVID-19 pandemic.

Introduction

46

The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that was declared as a pandemic by the World

47

Health Organization (WHO) on the 11th of March 2020 [1] has affected over 37 million people

48

and has caused more than one million deaths globally as of 12th October 2020 [2]. The new severe

49

acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has now spread to 213 countries and

50

territories around the world. Up to 20th September 2020, Ethiopia reported a total of 68,820

51

confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases and 28,314 recoveries from over

52

1,202,818 total tests, among whom 1,096 have died [3]. Over 1,311 health workers have contracted

53

coronavirus in Ethiopia as of 17th September 2020.

54
55

Healthcare providers who are in the healthcare settings to care for the COVID-19 patients are

56

highly vulnerable to SARS-COV-2 infection [4]. Most healthcare workers are working in isolation

57

units, critical care units, intensive care units (ICUs), emergency units, working in frontline

58

positions, and having contact with suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases. During the early

59

stage of COVID-19 pandemic in the USA, the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among

60

healthcare workers was 7.3% and particularly, infections were most common among nurses [5]. In

61

the south of the Netherlands, 96 (5%) of 1796 health care workers screened in three hospitals were

62

tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 just 10 days after the first reported COVID-19 case in the country

63

[6]. More than 278 physicians from almost all medical specialties have died due to COVID-19 as

64

of 15 April 2020 with the majority (44%) from Italy mainly because of lack understanding of the

65

virus and its preventive measures [7]. Studies in China reported 3,387 COVID-19 cases among

66

HCWs (4.4% of all cases), with 23 attributable deaths [8]. In some countries at the peak of their

67

infection, such as Spain, they have reported that 13% to 14% of the country’s cases were in

68

healthcare workers [9]. Overall, as much as 10% of healthcare workers are infected with SARS-

69

CoV-2 in some countries [4] and the WHO has developed infection prevention and control

70

guidance to be implemented at the national and healthcare facility level in order to reduce

71

coronavirus infection among healthcare workers [10].

72
73

Studies have identified major sources of worry and anxiety among healthcare professionals due to

74

lack of appropriate PPE; being exposed to COVID-19 at work and taking the infection home to

75

their family; not having rapid access to testing if they develop COVID-19 symptoms and

76

concomitant fear of propagating infection at work; uncertainty that their organization will

77

support/take care of their personal and family needs if they develop infection; access to childcare

78

during increased work hours and school closures; and support for other personal and family needs

79

as work hours and demands increase [11]. A recent qualitative study from China reported the

80

challenges facing frontline healthcare workers during the COVID-19 outbreak, including a high

81

risk of infection, insufficient PPE, heavy workloads and manpower shortages, confusion,

82

discrimination, isolation, separation from their families, and burnout [12]. Under these stressful

83

conditions, healthcare professionals have been challenged to effectively engaged in the fight

84

COVID-19.

85
86

A good level of understanding the risk perception and preventive practices of healthcare

87

professionals is essential to protect the health workers and prevent the COVID-19 pandemic

88

through effective risk communication. Studies conducted during the early stages of a pandemic

89

have suggested that perceived personal risk of infection and the health effects are linked to

90

engagement in protective behaviors [13]. Since the occurrence of the epidemic in Ethiopia, the

91

MoH, in collaboration with its partners, conducted different trainings on preventive measures for

92

healthcare professionals at several hospitals and health centers, with supplies of PPE materials.

93

However, so far, no study has been undertaken in Ethiopia on risk perception and preventive

94

practices of healthcare professionals during the current COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, levels

95

of confidence and feelings of healthcare workers about COVID-19 are unknown. It was therefore

96

necessary to carry out this study to investigate the level of risk perception and preventive practice

97

of healthcare professionals towards the COVID-19.

Methods

100

Study setting and design

101

This hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted from 9th to 26th June 2020 at six public

102

hospitals in Addis Ababa city administration, three months after the first confirmed COVID-19

103

case in Ethiopia in March 2020. Addis Ababa city is the most populated urban city in the country,

104

and had a population of about 3.6 million in 2019 [14]. The city also had better health infrastructure

105

and the highest number of qualified medical personnel compared with any city or region in the

106

country. There were 12 hospitals and close to 100 health centers belonging to the public center,

107

and about 25 private hospitals in Addis Ababa city. There were also over 17,000 healthcare

108

professionals in the city, including 2,441 (14%) physicians and 8,172 (47%) nurses by the end of

109

July 2019 (MOH 2011 EC Health Indicators). The hospitals selected for the current study provide

110

outpatient and inpatient services for the city residents and patients coming from different parts of

111

the country.

114

Study population and sampling

115

The study was conducted among all healthcare professionals working in the different clinical

116

departments or units of six public hospitals in Addis Ababa, mainly Gyn&Ob, Surgery, Pediatrics,

117

Internal Medicine, OPD, emergencies, intensive care, operation room/ward, screening/triage,

118

laboratory and anesthesia. The selected hospitals included: Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital

119

(TASH), Zewditu Memorial Hospital (ZMH), Ghandi Memorial Hospital (GMH), Menelik II

120

Hospital, Yekatit 12 Hospital Medical College (Y12HMC) and St. Paul Hospital Millennium

121

Medical College (SPHMMC). The study population included intern doctors, resident doctors,

122

general practitioners, medical specialists and sub-specialists, health officers, anesthetists, nurses,

123

midwives, pharmacists, laboratory technologists, physiotherapists, X-ray and laboratory

124

technicians, all of whom may expect to encounter suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients.

125
126

A multi-stage sampling, using a mix of purposive and non-random sampling, was applied to select

127

the study participants. In the first stage, the six hospitals were purposively selected from 12

128

hospitals in the city. In the second stage, clinical departments or units were selected, and in the

129

third stage, study participants were selected proportionally to the estimated number of healthcare

130

professionals working in different departments and units of the hospital. All eligible participants

131

in each department/unit who consented to participate were recruited into the study. Since COVID-

132

19 is a new disease, we assumed that at least 50% of study participants had higher risk perception

133

regarding COVID-19, and the estimated sample size was calculated with 95% confidence limit,

134

with 4% precision and a design effect equal to 1.5 using 20 % non-response rate. Accordingly, the

135

minimum total sample size targeted for this survey was 1,080 respondents. A total of 1,200

136

participants were targeted for the study.

Data Collection

139

A structured paper-based self-administered questionnaire was used to collect the data. The

140

questionnaire is composed of parts on the demographic (gender, age) and occupational

141

characteristics of the respondents (hospital, department/unit, professional category, and work

142

experience), as well as their preparedness to combat COVID-19, potential risk of becoming

143

infected with the virus, worries about the potential risk to their family and loved ones, feelings and

144

fears about COVID-19. Questions related to measures taken to prevent infection from the virus

145

included hand washing for at least 20 seconds, use of disinfectants, wearing facemask, physical

146

distancing, covering mouth and nose while coughing and sneezing and other preventive measures.

147

The questionnaire was developed in English by the authors of the study based on the previously

148

conducted studies and visiting the WHO websites for frequently asked questions on risk perception

149

of healthcare professionals. Most of the questions were designed as ‘yes/no’, ‘agree/disagree’, and

150

‘worried/not worried’ using different rating scales.

151
152

A total of 12 experienced data collectors with health backgrounds were involved in the data

153

collection of this survey. A guideline was developed by the research team to guide the data

154

collectors and supervisors for data collection, quality assurance of data and ethical conduct.

155

Training and orientation on the survey tool and methodology including how to administer the SAQ

156

were conducted for the data collectors using webinar on 2nd June 2020. After explaining the

157

purpose of the study and obtaining written or oral informed consent, study participants were given

158

a paper-based questionnaire at their workplace and they filled out their own questionnaires. The

159

purpose of the study was clearly stated in the questionnaire and the participants were asked to

160

complete the questionnaire with honest answers after giving their consents. The study participants

161

were encouraged to fill out the questionnaire whilst the data collectors were still in the hospital

162

during the data collection period. A collection center was also prepared in the Hospital Director’s

163

office to also gather the questionnaires from the healthcare workers that were unable to directly

164

deliver the completed questionnaires to the data collectors. The data collection took place

165

simultaneously in the six hospitals. The questionnaires were checked for completeness and

166

consistency upon collection. All responses were anonymous.

167
168

Risk perception among the healthcare professionals in this study was measured using questions on

169

perceived fears and worries, vulnerability and feelings, and behavioral responses regarding

170

COVID-19 [15-16]. Preventive practices of COVID-19 in this study include hygiene behaviors

171

(such as hand washing; covering mouth and nose with a hand or tissue while coughing or sneezing;

172

avoiding touching eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands; using hand sanitizer; disinfecting

173

surfaces); mask wearing, physical distancing and avoiding crowds and public places [17].

174
175

Data analysis

176

Data were entered into the Census Surveys Professional (CSPro) Version 7.2 statistical software

177

package and subsequently exported to SPSS version 23.0 (SPSS Inc., IBM, USA) for cleaning and

178

data analysis. Descriptive analysis was applied to calculate the frequencies, proportions and mean

179

scores, and the results were presented as a proportion for the categorical variables, and as a mean

180

± standard deviation for the quantitative variables. A Chi-square was used to establish significance

181

and relationship between variables. The study participants were asked 12 questions related to their

182

fears and worries (risk perception) about COVID-19, such as losing someone they love due to the

9

183

disease, health system overcrowding, mental and physical health, etc., on a 3-point scale, where

184

1=don’t worry at all, 2=worry somehow and 3=worry a lot. A sum of scores (ranged 12-36) was

185

made and the level was classified into two groups using the Visual Binning in SPSS (low

186

fear/worry ≤29 and high fear/worry >29 score). Univariate odds ratios (crude OR) and multivariate

187

odds ratio (adjusted OR) were derived by using univariate and multivariate logistic regression

188

models, respectively, to identify the main factors associated with healthcare workers high risk

189

perception. Statistical significance was considered for P<0.05. The internal consistency

190

(reliability) of the questions was tested by applying Cronbach’s alpha and the Cronbach’s alpha

191

coefficient of the reliability of scale was estimated at 0.91, which is highly acceptable.

192
193

Ethical considerations

194

The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of the College

195

of Health Sciences at Addis Ababa University (AAU). Permission to undertake this study was

196

obtained from every relevant authority at all levels. Official letters from AAU were written to each

197

hospital to cooperate and participate in the survey. The purpose and significance of the study was

198

introduced to the study participants, and all participants provided written or oral consent before

199

participating in the study. Anonymity and data confidentiality were ensured, and no identifiable

200

data from participants were collected. All study respondents were asked to only fill the

201

questionnaire once to avoid duplication of data and that their participation in the study was entirely

202

on voluntary basis. All personnel involved in the survey received orientation on COVID-19

203

infection prevention and control measures.

Characteristics of study participants

208

A total of 1,134 (92%) healthcare professionals consented and completed the questionnaires, out

209

of 1,228 possible participants from six public hospitals in Addis Ababa. Among 1,134 healthcare

210

personnel, nearly 40% of them were nurses, followed by physicians (22.4%) and interns (10.8%).

211

Table 1 summarizes the demographic and occupational characteristics of the study participants and

212

their professional affiliation. Among 1,102 respondents reporting gender, 45.9% were males, with

213

females making 51.3% of all respondents. Among 982 participants with available data on age, the

214

mean (±SD) age was 30.3±6.4 years and ranged from 22 to 70 years old, with the majority within

215

the age group of 20-29 years (57.9%) (31.0±5.6 years for physicians, 25.6±3.3 years for interns

216

and 30.7±6.5 years for nurses). Among 252 physicians participated in the study, general

217

practitioners and resident doctors accounted for 44.8% and 42.9%, respectively, while medical

218

specialists and sub-specialists accounted for the remaining 12.3%. About 17% of the respondents

219

represented other professional categories such as anesthetist, pharmacist, health officer,

220

radiographer and laboratory technologist. Majority (17.2%) of the respondents worked in Gny&Ob

221

department, while 13.8% were in surgical department, 13.3% in pediatrics, 13.0% in medical and

222

10.5% in OPD departments. Most respondents worked as staff for less than 10 years in the hospital

223

(73.2%), and nearly 10% worked for 10 or more years.

The self-reported prevalence of different preventive measures practiced by healthcare

233

professionals to prevent themselves from coronavirus infection is shown in Table 2. The overall

234

highest practice showed among healthcare participants were wearing facemask (93%), hand

235

washing for at least 20 seconds (92.7%), covering mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing

236

(90.9%), and avoiding touching eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands (90.5%). These

237

measures were commonly reported (>90%) for physicians, intern doctors, nurses and other

*Other: Includes anesthetist, pharmacist, health officer, lab technologist and radiographer.

healthcare professionals except the midwives who reported <90%. A lower percentage of self-

239

reported practices were observed in physical distancing (84.3%), the use of disinfecting surfaces

240

(76.1%), and staying home when feeling cold or sick (64.6%), with similar pattern across the

This study also investigated the attitude of the healthcare workers with regard to which group of

246

people they recommend to use a facemask or N95 respirator. The vast majority of the respondents

247

(94.8%) recommended the use of a facemask by all healthcare professionals, all healthy people to

248

protect themselves from coronavirus infection (90.1%), and people with close contact with

249

suspected or confirmed COVID-19 (88.8%). About 87% of all respondents suggested that N95

250

respirator should be used by all healthcare professionals as well as by people who are being in

251

close contact with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients. About five in 10 (48%) of the

252

respondents recommended the use of N95 respirator by healthy people to protect themselves

253

against coronavirus infection. About 65% and 48% of the respondents from TASH and SPHMMC,

254

respectively, recommended the use of N95 respirator for all healthy people to protect themselves

255

from COVID-19.

Exposure and preparedness in providing care to COVID-19 and other infectious disease

258

outbreaks

259

Only about one-third (30.7%) of the study participated reported that they ever participated in direct

260

clinical care to patients affected by infectious disease outbreaks such as Ebola, SARS and cholera.

261

Nearly three in 10 (28.9%, n=328) respondents reported that they ever provided direct clinical care

262

to at least one suspected/confirmed COVID-19 patient, with 39.1% participants from SPHMMC,

263

34.5% from MH and 31.1% from TASH. Regarding the level of preparedness of healthcare

264

professionals to provide direct clinical care to COVID-19 patients, 33.6% (n=381) reported that

265

they were prepared to provide direct clinical care to COVID-19 patients. In contrast, about two-

266

third (66.4%) of the healthcare workers reported that they were not prepared to manage COVID-

267

19 patients.

269

Risk perception of healthcare professionals due to their role in the COVID-19 pandemic

270

The study participants were asked questions about their personal health, potential risks of

271

becoming infected with COVID-19 or the potential risks to their families and loved ones due to

272

their clinical role in the hospital. About 30% and 43% of the participants somewhat or strongly

273

worried, respectively, that their personal health is at risk during the COVID-19 pandemic due to

274

their role in the hospital (Table 3). Nevertheless, 6% and 13.5% of respondents reported that they

275

somewhat not worried or even not worried at all that their personal health was not at risk due to

276

COVID-19. About 38% and 50% of all respondents perceived that they were somewhat worried

277

or extremely worried about themselves, respectively, due to the potential risk of becoming infected

278

with coronavirus by their clinical role in the hospital setting these days, with only 5.6% perceived

279

that they were not worried about the risk of being infected with the virus. Majorities of the

280

respondents (64.4%) extremely worried about the potential risk of infection to their family and

281

loved ones, and the remaining 26.7% were somewhat worried. Only 4.4% of the respondents were

The study participants were asked 12 questions to quantify their fears and worries (risk perception)

288

about COVID-19 crisis, on a 3-point scale, where 1=don’t worry at all, 2=worry somehow and

289

3=worry a lot. Of the total 1134 study participants, 952 (84%) had complete responses on all the

290

12-items for computing the total score. About 66% of the respondents reported that they worried

291

a lot about losing someone due to COVID-19, 66.7% worried a lot about the health of their loved

292

ones, and 67.5% worried a lot about the health system being overloaded by the patients of COVID-

293

19, followed by a lot of worries about the economic recession in the country (58%), and restricted

294

access to food supplies (56.1%) (Table 4). The study also revealed that there were respondents

295

who were ambivalent or didn’t worry at all about COVID-19 crisis.

301

An overall fear and worry index about COVID-19 was created using 12 questions. The overall

302

score for the scale was calculated by summing up the score of all questions (from 12 to 36). The

303

higher the score, the greater the fear and worry of the COVID-19. Table 5 presents the mean scores

304

for each and the overall worry indicators of COVID-19 crisis by professional category. Overall,

305

the participants reported an average of moderate-to-high levels of COVID-19 worry (2.37) on each

306

item, ranging from 2.1 on ‘becoming unemployed’ to 2.6 on ‘losing someone they love’, ‘health

307

system being overloaded’ and ‘someone’s loved health’. The overall average worry score of the

308

12 items for the COVID-19 crisis was high, with a mean (±SD) of 28.4 (±5.9), ranging from 12 to

309

36. The total average fear and worry scores for the hospitals ranged from 25.6 (±6.8) at TASH to

310

31.3 (±5.0) at GMH; and was further categorized into three levels i.e. low, moderate, and high fear

311

and worry level. Figure 1 shows the pattern of the total fear and worry scores of COVID-19 crisis,

312

and about 56% of respondents from TASH showed a relatively low fear and worry score compared

313

to the highest (50.9%) fear and worry score reported by participants from GMH.

Binning in SPSS (low fear/worry ≤29 and high fear/worry >29 score). Table 6 shows the results

326

of bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses of predictors associated with

327

respondents mean scores of fears and worries about COVID-19 crisis. In the bivariate analyses

328

departments/units and the hospitals were significantly associated with fear and worry scores of

329

COVID-19 crises. Nurses were 1.52 times more likely to report fear and worry (OR=1.52, 95%

330

CI:1.09-2.13, P<0.015), and healthcare workers who ever participated in clinical care to Ebola,

331

SARS and cholera patients were 0.67 times less likely to report fear and worry due to COVID-19

332

fear and worry about COVID-19 crisis (Table 6). In contrast, respondents from GMH were more

342

likely to fear and worry for COVID-19 crisis (adjusted OR=1.77, 95% CI:1.10-3.18) than those

343

from the SPHMMC respondents. Healthcare professionals ever provided clinical care to suspected/

344

confirmed COVID-19 patients were 1.34 times more likely to report fear and worry due to COVID-

345

19 crises (OR=1.34, 95% CI:1.02-1.91, P=0.037), however respondents who ever participated in

346

clinical care to Ebola, SARS and cholera patients were 0.66 times less likely to report fear and

347

worry due to COVID-19 crisis (OR=0.66, 95% CI:0.48-0.90, P=0.009). Gender, professional

348

category and preparedness to provide direct care to COVID-19 patients did not appear significant

349

in the multivariable logistic regression model to predict the odds of fear and worry score for

350

COVID-19 crisis.

Discussion

353

Since its emergence in December 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic is a global public health concern

354

and the most current topic of discussion across every facet of life, especially among the healthcare

355

professionals and patients. This study was conducted in Addis Ababa city during 09-26 June 2020,

356

three months after detection of the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Ethiopia. Addis Ababa

357

city is the most affected part in the country. The study aimed to assess the risk perceptions and

358

protective behaviors of COVID-19 among healthcare professionals in the city. Our study

359

participants include medical doctors, interns, nurses, midwives, pharmacists, medical laboratory

360

technologists, and technicians. These categories of healthcare professionals have direct or indirect

361

close personal exposures with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients while performing their

362

clinical duties.

364

The overwhelming majority of the participants in our study reported a high level of practice

365

towards the prevention of COVID-19 infection particularly regarding using facemask, hand

366

washing for at least 20 seconds, covering mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing, and

367

avoiding touching eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands as far as possible. This finding is

368

consistent with the finding of a similar study conducted in China, where the risk of spread of

369

COVID-19 has largely improved the infection prevention and control behaviors of healthcare

370

professionals working in hospitals [18]. In a study conducted in Egypt, hand washing, refraining

371

from touching eyes, mouth and nose, and using surgical facemask were the most frequently

372

accepted preventive measures among health workers [19]. The WHO recommends the use of

373

primary preventive measures that includes regular hand washing, social distancing, and respiratory

374

hygiene (covering mouth and nose while coughing or sneezing) by healthcare workers in order to

375

prevent the spread of the virus among themselves and patient’s close contacts [20].

376
377

Studies conducted during the early stage of the pandemic revealed that healthcare workers had

378

insufficient knowledge about COVID-19 pandemic to protect themselves from coronavirus

379

infection [21]. In one study in Greece, only 25% of healthcare practitioners washed their hands

380

after touching a patient, despite the fact that 94% of the respondents knew that SARS-CoV-2

381

transmission could be reduced with hand washing [22]. Although hand washing is recommended

382

for the general public in order to prevent the transmission of COVID-19, hand hygiene is

383

mandatory for health care practitioners, in order to prevent infections, both for oneself and for the

384

patients [23]. In the present study, the use of facemask was reported to be 93%. A recent study

385

conducted in Addis Ababa just before our study revealed that about two-third of the healthcare

386

workers demonstrated a poor practice of facemask utilization [24]. Similar results were reported

22

387

in North-East India that majority of the healthcare workers (91%) reported that they used surgical

388

masks, 97% were using hand sanitizer and 97% participants were properly using hand hygiene

389

[25].

390
391

In the present study, the majority of the study participants recommended mask-wearing by all

392

healthcare professionals, all healthy people to protect themselves from coronavirus infection, and

393

people with close contact with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Similarly, about 87% of the

394

respondents suggested that N95 respirator should be used by all healthcare professionals as well

395

as by people who are being in close contact with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients. In

396

Pakistan, 71% of the healthcare workers believed that wearing general medical masks was

397

protective against COVID-19 [26], and studies also suggested that surgical masks are similarly as

398

effective as N95 respirators if used with hand wash and other infection prevention precautions

399

[27]. However, a rapid systematic review on the efficacy of facemasks and respirators against

400

coronaviruses and other respiratory transmissible viruses reported that continuous use of

401

respirators is more protective compared to the medical masks, and medical masks are more

402

protective than cloth masks among health workers in healthcare settings [28].

403
404

This study demonstrated that about one-third of all respondents in our study either participated in

405

direct clinical care to patients affected by an infectious disease outbreak (e.g., Ebola virus, SARS,

406

cholera, Zika virus) (31%) or provided direct clinical care at least for one suspected or confirmed

407

COVID-19 patients (29%) during the current COVID-19 epidemic. This percentage is higher from

408

other studies on this subject in the early days of the COVID-19 outbreak in China [29]. A

409

significant number (38%) of healthcare professionals in the current study expressed lack of or low

410

level of preparedness to manage suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients. This raises a concern

411

regarding the ability and confidence of the healthcare workers to combat COVID-19 infection.

412

Despite these concerns, along with the shortage of PPE and inadequate training during the COVID-

413

19, the healthcare workers continue to work with the management of suspected or confirmed

414

COVID-19, working in the hospital setting where COVID-19 patients were admitted, risking their

415

lives to save their patients. However, this could highlight the risk of infection among healthcare

416

workers and cross-contamination within hospitals and could lead to a higher rate of hospital-

417

acquired infections. Therefore, our study provides considerable insights into the necessity of

418

immediate and determined efforts focused on training programs and providing an adequate supply

419

of PPE to ensure the safety of health personnel during the COVID-19 pandemic [30].

420
421

In the present study, about 88% of the healthcare professionals were afraid of being infected with

422

the disease and about 91% were worried about the potential risk of transmitting the virus to their

423

family and loved ones. The risk of contracting the virus was perceived to be very high at the time

424

of the study. Healthcare workers expressed worry and fear of infection due to the contagious nature

425

of the virus, close contact with suspected and confirmed COVID-19 patients, and infection

426

happening to their family and colleagues. In Iran, it was found that about 92% of the healthcare

427

workers worried about being infected with the virus and transmitting it to the family [31]. In a

428

study conducted in Henan province of China, 89% of healthcare workers had sufficient knowledge

429

of COVID-19, 85% were concerned about infection with the virus, and 90% followed correct

430

practices regarding the prevention of COVID-19 [32]. About 83% of the healthcare workers in

431

Egypt reported increased risk perception because of the concern of being infected with COVID-

432

19 and fear of transmitting the disease to their families, and 89% stated that they were more

433

susceptible to COVID-19 infection mainly due to the shortage of PPE [19].

435

In the current study, the overall risk perception expressed in fear and worry score of the study

436

participants regarding COVID-19 crisis was considerably higher, with a mean of 28, ranging from

437

12 to 36. Various studies have reported the psychological impact of COVID-19 on healthcare

438

professionals [33]. A recent scoping review found that the frontline healthcare workers are at an

439

increased risk of direct physical and mental consequences as the result of providing care to patients

440

with COVID-19 [34]. Studies demonstrated that more than 50% of healthcare professionals report

441

symptoms of depression, insomnia, and anxiety due to COVID-19 [35]. A recent study carried out

442

in Pakistan on fear and anxiety among healthcare professionals reported that about three-fourth of

443

them had fear of getting infected during the management of COVID-19 patients, and another two-

444

third reported severe anxiety, which was particularly more common among nurses [36]. Studies

445

also reported excessive workload, isolation, mental stress and discrimination among frontline

446

health professionals, thus, contributing to physical exhaustion, emotional disturbance, worry and

447

fear [37]. A Cochrane review reported the suffering of healthcare workers from work-related or

448

occupational stress, which can be reduced by cognitive-behavioral training as well as mental and

449

physical relaxation [38]. A multicenter study conducted among frontline nurses in China showed

450

poor mental health during the COVID-19 outbreak, mainly due to the fear of contracting the virus

451

and high workload [39]. Moreover, the same study revealed that nurses who were confident in

452

their infection control knowledge and skills had lower stress levels than those who felt less

453

prepared.

454
455

Finally, this study had several limitations. First, the study had a potential to be affected by selection

456

bias and eligible participants might be excluded. Second, this study was conducted in six public

457

hospitals in Addis Ababa, and may possibly limit the generalization of the results and findings to

458

other public and private hospitals. Third, the study focused on more general populations of
25

459

healthcare professionals similar to other studies [32,40] rather than healthcare workers who might

460

have direct contact with COVID-19 patients [41]. Finally, the results of this study are based on

461

self-reported data, and the respondents may overestimate or underestimate the responses in a way

462

that they believe is socially acceptable rather than reporting actual or genuine answers. Despite

463

these limitations, the results obtained provide important information to guide health

464

communication efforts that can support prevention efforts of COVID-19 among healthcare

465

professionals.

466
467

Conclusions

468

In conclusion, our study has illuminated the current level of risk perception and preventive

469

practices of COVID-19 among healthcare professionals, with a special focus on those working in

470

the clinical departments of the hospitals who have direct or indirect contact with COVID-19

471

patients. The present study findings demonstrated that healthcare professionals participated in the

472

study showed a universally higher preventive practices to prevent COVID-19 infections. The

473

healthcare workers perceived high level of COVID-19 risk particularly due to shortage of PPE,

474

and majority reported that they didn’t receive any training in infection prevention and control

475

measures since COVID-19, although they had adequate level of practice to protect themselves

476

from the infection of novel coronavirus. Likewise, majority of the participants reported that they

477

worried about the potential risk of becoming infected with COVID-19 and transmitting the disease

478

to their family. The present study also was able to identify factors associated with fear and worry

479

related to COVID-19 crisis in order to address them during the implementation of risk

480

communication programs with the public and healthcare during the current COVID-19 pandemic.
