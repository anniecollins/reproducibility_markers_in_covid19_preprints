Abstract
The current practice for diagnosis of COVID-19, based on SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing of
pharyngeal or respiratory specimens in a symptomatic patient at high epidemiologic risk,
likely underestimates the true prevalence of infection. Serologic methods can more
accurately estimate the disease burden by detecting infections missed by the limited
testing performed to date. Here, we describe the validation of a coronavirus antigen
microarray containing immunologically significant antigens from SARS-CoV-2, in addition
to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, common human coronavirus strains, and other common
respiratory viruses. A comparison of antibody profiles detected on the array from control
sera collected prior to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic versus convalescent blood specimens
from virologically confirmed COVID-19 cases demonstrates near complete discrimination
of these two groups, with improved performance from use of antigen combinations that
include both spike protein and nucleoprotein. This array can be used as a diagnostic tool,
as an epidemiologic tool to more accurately estimate the disease burden of COVID-19,
and as a research tool to correlate antibody responses with clinical outcomes.

Introduction
COVID-19 caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus is a worldwide pandemic with significant
morbidity and mortality estimates from 1-4% of confirmed cases1. The current case
definition for confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection relies on PCR-positive pharyngeal or
respiratory specimens, with testing largely determined by presence of fever or respiratory
symptoms in an individual at high epidemiologic risk. However, this case definition likely
underestimates true prevalence, as individuals who develop subclinical infection that
does not produce fever or respiratory symptoms are unlikely to be tested, and testing by
PCR of pharyngeal or respiratory specimens is only around 60-80% sensitive depending
on sampling location and technique and the patient’s viral load2. Widespread testing
within the United States is also severely limited by the lack of available testing kits and
testing capacity limitations of available public and private laboratories. Therefore, the true
prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection is likely much higher than currently reported case
numbers would indicate.
Serology can play an important role in defining the true prevalence of COVID-19,
particularly for subclinical infection2. Early studies of serology demonstrate high
sensitivity to detect confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, with antibodies to virus detected
approximately 1 to 2 weeks after symptom onset3. Unlike PCR positivity, SARS-CoV-2
antibodies are detectable throughout the disease course and persist indefinitely4. Multiple
serologic tests have been developed for COVID-195 including a recently FDA-approved
lateral flow assay. However, these tests are limited to detection of antibodies against one
or two antigens, and cross-reactivity with antibodies to other human coronaviruses that
are present in all adults6 is currently unknown. Prior use of serology for detection of
emerging coronaviruses focused on antibodies against the spike (S) protein, particularly
the S1 domain, and the nucleocapsid protein (NP)7. However, the optimal set of antigens
to detect strain-specific coronavirus antibodies remains unknown.
Protein microarray technology can be used to detect antibodies of multiple isotypes
against hundreds of antigens in a high throughput manner8,9 so is well suited to serologic
surveillance studies. This technology, which has previously been applied to other
emerging coronaviruses10, is based on detection of binding antibodies, which are wellcorrelated with neutralizing antibodies11 but do not require viral culture in biosafety level
3 facilities. Recently, our group developed a coronavirus antigen microarray (CoVAM)
that includes antigens from SARS-CoV-2 and tested it on human sera collected prior to
the pandemic to demonstrate low cross-reactivity with antibodies from human
coronaviruses that cause the common cold, particularly for the S1 domain2. Here, we
further validate this methodology using convalescent blood specimens from COVID-19
cases confirmed by positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR.
Methodology
Specimen Collection
A total of 22 de-identified SARS-CoV-2 convalescent blood specimens were collected
from nasopharyngeal PCR-positive individuals from different sources with associated
data on symptom onset, positive PCR test, and collection (Supplementary Table 1). Two
sera were obtained as de-identified discarded laboratory specimens from acute COVID-

19 patients from the Oregon Health Sciences University Hospital (OHSU), Portland, OR.
These were sourced from discarded clinical laboratory specimens exempted from
informed consent and IRB approval under condition of patient anonymity. An additional
two sera were obtained from recovered COVID patients at Vitalant Research Institute in
San Francisco, CA under an IRB approved protocol. One convalescent plasma was
obtained by Cerus Corporation after isolation from a large-volume apheresis collection
following standard protocol from a documented recovered COVID-19 blood donor who
was more than 28 days post symptomatic. Four plasma samples were obtained from
outpatients of the University Hospital Basel, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.
These patients were screened in accordance with Swiss regulations on blood donation
and approved as plasma donors according to the Blood Transfusion Service of the Swiss
Red Cross with informed consent. These donors were diagnosed with COVID-19 based
on SARS-CoV-2 positive nasopharyngeal swab PCR tests. At time of plasma donation,
each had two negative nasopharyngeal swab SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests and negative
SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests in blood, and they were qualified as plasma donors. Plasma was
collected from these convalescent donors at the Regional Blood Transfusion Service of
the Swiss Red Cross in accordance with national regulations.
A total of 144 de-identified pre-pandemic control sera used in this study were collected
between November 2018 and May 2019 for a larger study where residents of a college
resident community in the Eastern United States were monitored prospectively to identify
acute respiratory infection (ARI) cases using questionnaires and RT-qPCR, so as to
characterize contagious phenotypes including social connections, built environment, and
immunologic phenotypes12. Electronic informed consents including future research use
authorization was obtained under protocols approved by the Institutional Review Boards
(IRBs) of the University of Maryland and the Department of Navy Human Research
Protections Office.
Specimen Testing on Coronavirus Antigen Microarray
The coronavirus antigen microarray used in this investigation includes 67 antigens across
subtypes expressed in either baculovirus or HEK-293 cells (Supplementary Table 2).
These antigens were provided by Sino Biological U.S. Inc. (Wayne, PA) as either catalog
products or custom synthesis service products. The antigens were printed onto
microarrays, probed with human sera, and analyzed as previously described9,13,14.
Briefly, lyophilized antigens were reconstituted with sterile water to a concentration of 0.1
mg/mL bringing protein solution to 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and printing buffer
was added. Antigens were then printed onto ONCYTE AVID nitrocellulose-coated slides
(Grace Bio-Labs, Bend, OR) using an OmniGrid 100 microarray printer (GeneMachines).
The microarray slides were probed with human sera diluted 1:100 in 1x Protein Array
Blocking Buffer (GVS Life Sciences, Sanford, ME) overnight at 4°C and washed with TTBS buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween-20 in ddH2O adjusted to pH
7.5 and filtered) 3 times for 5 minutes each. A mixture of human IgG and IgA secondary
antibodies conjugated to quantum dot fluorophores Q800 and Q585 respectively was
applied to each of the microarray pads and incubated for 2 hours at room temperature,
and pads were then washed with T-TBS 3 times for 5 minutes each and dried. The slides
were imaged using ArrayCam imager (Grace Bio-Labs, Bend, OR) to measure
background-subtracted median spot fluorescence. Non-specific binding of secondary

antibodies was subtracted using saline control. Mean fluorescence of the 4 replicate spots
for each antigen was used for analysis.
Statistical Analyses
The mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of each antigen was determined by the average
of the median fluorescence signal of four replicate spots. The fluorescence signal for each
spot was determined by its signal intensity subtracted by the background fluorescence.
Antigens containing a human Fc tag were removed from the analysis, as the secondary
antibodies used for quantification are known to bind to human Fc; non-human Fc tag did
not interfere with the assay. All statistical analyses were conducted using R version 3.6.3
(R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).
MFI was normalized by the quantile normalization method using the proprocessCore
package (version 1.48.0). As a target for normalization, a vector containing the median
MFI for IgG or IgA was constructed. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the
IgA and IgG reactivity measured as MFI. Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests with p < 0.05 corrected
for multiple comparisons were used to compare the mean differences between groups.
In order to rank the antigens from SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV for
performance in discriminating the positive and negative groups, the Receiver Operating
Characteristic Area Under the Curve (ROC AUC) values for each antigen were calculated
by comparing positive and negative specimens using the pROC package (version 1.16.2).
For this, the samples were randomly partitioned into two groups, at a ratio of 75%/25%,
using the caret package (version 6.9-86). The group with 75% of the samples was used
to create a regression model using the glm function form the stats package (version
3.6.3). The 25% subset was used to predict the outcome of each sample being classified
as negative or positive using the stat package and the AUC value calculated. This process
was repeated for one thousand times and the final AUC values calculated as the median
values of all repetitions.
Next, in order to evaluate the benefit of combining antigens for an increased prediction
performance, the top ranked antigens, using a cutoff point of auc = 0.85, were combined
into groups of all possible combinations from 2 to 4 antigens using the combinat package
(version 0.0-8). Again, the auc values for each combination were calculated using the
same procedure as for individual antigens and the calculated AUCs are representative of
the median AUC from one thousand repetitions.
The optimal sensitivity and specificity for each antigen and combination of antigens was
calculated based on the maximum Youden Index. Data visualization was performed using
the ggplot2 package (version 3.3.0) or pROC package.
Results
Construction of Coronavirus Antigen Microarray
A coronavirus antigen microarray (COVAM) was constructed containing 65 antigens that
are causes of acute respiratory infections. The array was used to detect IgG and IgA
antibodies present in a collection of blood specimens from recovered COVID-19 patients
and pre-pandemic control sera, and the results are shown on the heatmap in Figure 1.
The viral antigens printed on this array are from epidemic coronaviruses including SARS-

CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV, common cold coronaviruses (HKU1, OC43, NL63,
229E), and multiple subtypes of influenza, adenovirus, metapneumovirus, parainfluenza,
and respiratory syncytial virus as listed in Supplementary Table 2. The SARS-CoV-2
antigens on this array include spike protein (S), the receptor-binding (RBD), S1, and S2
domains the whole protein (S1+S2), and the nucleocapsid protein (NP). There is a similar
set of antigens represented on the array from SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and the four
common cold coronaviruses.
Discrimination of SARS-CoV-2 Convalescent Blood Specimens Using Coronavirus
Antigen Microarray
To determine the antibody profile of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the differential reactivity to
these antigens was evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 convalescent blood specimens from PCRpositive individuals (positive group) and sera collected prior to the COVID-19 pandemic
from naïve individuals (negative control group). As shown in the heatmap (Figure 1), the
positive group is highly reactive against SARS-CoV-2 antigens. This is more evident for
the IgG reactivity then for IgA. The negative controls do not show high reactivity to SARSCoV-2, SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV antigens despite showing high reactivity to the
common cold coronavirus antigens.
With respect to specific antigens, positive group displays high IgG reactivity to SARSCoV-2 NP, S2, and S1+S2 antigens and to a lesser degree SARS-CoV-2 S1 (Figure 2).
The positive group also demonstrates high IgG cross-reactivity against SARS-CoV NP
and MERS-CoV S2 and S1+S2 antigens, while the negative group demonstrates low
cross-reactivity with S1+S2 and S2 antigens from SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV and no
cross-reactivity against other SARS-CoV-2 antigens. The IgA reactivity profile is shown
on Figure 3. Overall, IgA seems to follow a similar pattern to IgG, with higher reactivity to
SARS-CoV-2 NP, S2 and S1+S2, cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV NP, but no crossreactivity to the MERS-CoV antigens.
The two groups do not differ significantly in reactivity to antigens from common cold
coronaviruses or other respiratory viruses for either IgG or IgA. The differences between
the groups appear to be restricted to SARS-CoV-2 antigens and cross-reactive SARSCoV and MERS-CoV antigens, so these antigens from epidemic coronaviruses were the
focus of subsequent analysis.
Selection of High-Performing Antigens to Detect SARS-CoV-2 Infection
The sensitivity a specificity of each antigen from SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERSCoV was evaluated to discriminate the positive group from the negative group across a
full range of assay cutoff values using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves
for which Area Under Curve (AUC) was measured (Figure 4). High-performing antigens
for detection of IgG or IgA were defined by ROC AUC > 0.85.
Although the antigen ranking was different for IgG and IgA, most of the high-ranking
antigens were from SARS-CoV-2 and most of the low-ranking antigens were from SARSCoV and MERS-CoV (Table 1). Among the high-performing antigens, four antigens were
ranked as high-performing antigens for both IgG and IgA: SARS-CoV-2 NP, SARS-CoV
NP, SARS-CoV-2 S1+S2, and SARS-CoV-2_S2. For IgG, additional high-performing
antigens included SARS-CoV-2 S1 (with mouse Fc tag) and RBD and MERS-CoV S2.

Each of the high-performing antigens discriminated between the positive group and the
negative group with high significance based on differential reactivity as shown in Figure
5. Positive samples consistently show significantly higher reactivity to these antigens than
the negative controls (p < 10-7). For IgG, the median reactivity to the top antigens for the
positive group is 20-fold higher than for the negative group, while a 6-fold difference is
observed for IgA.
The optimal sensitivity and specificity were also estimated for the six high-performing
antigens based on the Youden Index (Table 2). For IgG, the lowest sensitivity was seen
for SARS-CoV-2 S1, which correlates with the relatively lower reactivity to this antigen in
the positive group, while sensitivity was high for the other antigens. The lowest specificity
was seen for SARS-CoV-2 S2, which correlates with the cross-reactivity for this antigen
seen in a subset of the negative group, while specificity was high for the other antigens.
Conversely, for IgA, the highest sensitivity is seen with SARS-CoV-2 S1+S2, and the
highest specificity is seen with SARS-CoV-2 S2.
Determination of Optimal Antigen Combination to Detect SARS-CoV-2 Infection
In order to estimate the gain in performance by combining antigens, all possible
combinations of up to 4 of the 7 high-performing antigens were tested in silico for
performance in discriminating the positive and negative groups. The ROC curve with
AUC, sensitivity, and specificity was calculated for each combination. For both IgG and
IgA, there is a clear gain in performance by combining antigens.
The highest performing antigen combinations for each number of antigens are
summarized in Table 2, and ROC curves for the top-performing antigen combinations
overall for IgG and IgA with comparison to each individual antigen are shown in Figure 6.
For IgG, the best discrimination was achieved with the 2-antigen combination of SARSCoV-2 S2 and SARS-CoV NP, with similar performance upon the addition of SARS-CoV2 S1 with mouse Fc tag (AUC = 0.994, specificity = 1, sensitivity = 0.944). For IgA, the
top performance was achieved with the 2-antigen combination of SARS-CoV-2 S1+S2
and SARS-CoV NP, with similar performance upon the addition of SARS-CoV-2 S1 with
mouse Fc tag (AUC = 0.969, specificity = 0.895, sensitivity = 0.944). The addition of a
fourth antigen decreased the performance for both IgG and IgA.
Discussion
This study reveals several insights into the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The antibody profiles of naïve individuals include high IgG reactivity to common cold
coronaviruses with low-level cross-reactivity with S2 domains from SARS-CoV-2 and
other epidemic coronaviruses, which is not surprising given the high degree of sequence
homology and previously observed serologic cross-reactivity15 between S2 domains of
betacoronaviruses, a group that includes SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS, and common
cold coronaviruses HKU1 and OC43. This low-level cross-reactivity occurs in
approximately 7% of unexposed individuals (Figure 1), which leads to hypotheses
regarding whether these individuals differ in COVID-19 susceptibility and outcomes.
However, naïve individuals do not show cross-reactivity to other SARS-CoV-2 antigens.
Even for the nucleocapsid protein, which also has high sequence homology between
betacoronaviruses, cross-reactivity is only seen between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV
and not with MERS-CoV or common cold coronaviruses. In addition, the quantitative

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.15.043364; this version posted May 8, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

difference between high antibody reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 S2 in the positive group and
low-level antibody cross-reactivity in the negative group is large enough that these
antigens still discriminate these groups with high significance.
This study also informs antigen selection and design for population surveillance and
clinical diagnostic assays and vaccine development. The optimal assay to discriminate
SARS-CoV-2 convalescent sera from pre-pandemic sera is a combination of 2 antigens
that includes S2 and NP. As an individual antigen, the S2 demonstrates cross-reactivity
with negative control sera which leads to low specificity, but this antigen adds predictive
power when combined with the more specific NP antigen. The observation that
unexposed individuals with antibodies to common cold coronaviruses do not show crossreactivity to SARS-CoV-2 NP dispels concerns that the high sequence homology of this
protein across betacoronaviruses would impair its performance as a diagnostic antigen.
The low-level antibody cross-reactivity of a subset of unexposed ndividuals for SARSCoV-2 spike protein containing S2 domain may not preclude its use as a diagnostic
antigen given large quantitative difference in antibody reactivity between positive and
negative groups, but this cross-reactivity may influence response to vaccination with spike
protein antigens containing the S2 domain in this subset of individuals.
The coronavirus antigen microarray can be useful both as an epidemiologic tool and as
a research tool. The high throughput detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody
profiles that reliably distinguish COVID-19 cases from negative controls can be applied
to large-scale population surveillance studies for a more accurate estimation of the true
prevalence of disease than can be achieved with symptom-based PCR testing. In
addition, detection of these antibodies in SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma donations
can provide validation prior to clinical use for passive immunization. The variation in the
SARS-CoV-2 antibody profiles among acute and convalescent donors suggests that
epitope characterization of convalescent donor plasma will be informative for evaluation
of passive immune therapy efficacy in COVID-19 patients. The central role of
inflammation in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-1916 can be more closely studied by
analyzing both strain-specific and cross-reactive antibody responses, particularly to test
hypotheses regarding antibody-dependent enhancement with critical implications for
vaccine development17.
Conclusions
A coronavirus antigen microarray containing a panel of antigens from SARS-CoV-2 in
addition to other human coronaviruses was able to reliably distinguish convalescent
plasma of PCR-positive COVID-19 cases from negative control sera collected prior to the
pandemic. Antigen combinations including both spike protein and nucleoprotein
demonstrated improved performance compared to each individual antigen. Further
studies are needed to apply this methodology to large-scale serologic surveillance studies
and to correlate specific antibody responses with clinical outcomes.

Author Contributions
The coronavirus antigen microarray was designed by S. Khan and P. Felgner and was
constructed by R. Nakajima and A. Jasinskas at UCI. The negative control sera were
collected as research specimens for the Prometheus Study Group by D. Milton, O.
Adenaiye, S. Tai, and F. Hong at UMD. The positive COVID-19 convalescent blood
specimens were collected as research specimens by L. Corash and A. Bagri at Cerus;
M. Busch, G. Simmons, M. Stone, and P. Norris at Vitalant; M. Schreiber at OHSU; P.
Hosimer, C. Noesen, and P. Contestable at Ortho Clinical Diagnostics; and A. Buser,
A. Holbro, and M. Battegay at University Hospital Basel. The testing of specimens on
the coronavirus antigen microarray was performed by A. Jain and J. Felgner at UCI.
The data analysis was performed by R. de Assis and J. Obiero at UCI. The manuscript
and figures were prepared by S. Khan and R. de Assis with input and approval from all
other authors.
Competing Interests
The coronavirus antigen microarray is intellectual property of the Regents of the
University of California that is licensed for commercialization to Nanommune Inc. (Irvine,
CA), a private company for which P. Felgner is the largest shareholder and several coauthors (R. de Assis, A. Jain, R. Nakajima, A. Jasinskas, J. Obiero, H. Davies, and S.
Khan) also own shares. Nanommune Inc. has a business partnership with Sino
Biological Inc. (Beijing, China) which expressed and purified the antigens used in this
study.
The convalescent plasma used in this study was collected for clinical use by
independent blood centers using licensed plasma or platelet processing systems
manufactured by Cerus Corporation, for which multiple authors (L. Corash, A. Bagri) are
shareholders and employees. Convalescent sera were also provided by Ortho Clinical
Diagnostics, which is using these specimens to validate a clinical diagnostic test, and P.
Hosimer, C. Noesen, and P. Contestable are shareholders and employees of this
company.
