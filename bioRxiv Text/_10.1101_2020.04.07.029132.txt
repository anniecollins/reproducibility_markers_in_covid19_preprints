Abstract
Since 2002, beta coronaviruses (CoV) have caused three zoonotic outbreaks, SARSCoV in 2002, MERS-CoV in 2012, and the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 late in
2019 (also named as COVID-19 or novel coronavirus 2019 or nCoV2019. Spike(S)
protein, one of the structural proteins of this virus plays key role in receptor (ACE2)
binding and thus virus entry. Thus, this protein has attracted scientists for detailed
study and therapeutic targeting. As the 2019 novel coronavirus takes its course
throughout the world, more and more sequence analyses are been done and genome
sequences getting deposited in various databases. From India two clinical isolates
have been sequenced and the full genome deposited in GenBank. We have performed
sequence analyses of the spike protein of the Indian isolates and compared with that
of the Wuhan, China (where the outbreak was first reported). While all the sequences
of Wuhan isolates are identical, we found point mutations in the Indian isolates. Out of
the two isolates one was found to harbour a mutation in its Receptor binding domain
(RBD) at position 407. At this site arginine (a positively charged amino acid) was
replaced by isoleucine (a hydrophobic amino acid that is also a C-beta branched
amino acid). This mutation has been seen to change the secondary structure of the
protein at that region and this can potentially alter receptor ding of the virus. Although
this finding needs further validation and more sequencing, the information might be
useful in rational drug designing and vaccine engineering.

Introduction
A virus gone viral. First case of COVID-19 was reported in December 2019 at Wuhan
(China) and then it has spread worldwide becoming a pandemic, with maximum death
cases in Italy, although initially, the maximum mortality was reported from China[1].
According to a WHO report, as of 02.04.2020 there were confirmed 8, 23,626 COVID19 cases and 40598 deaths, that includes cases which were both locally transmitted
or imported[2]. There are published reports which suggest that SARS-CoV2 shares
highest similarity with bat SARS-CoV[3]. Scientists across the globe are trying to
elucidate the genome characteristics using phylogenetic, structural and mutational
studies[4]. Spike protein, one of the key proteins of SARS-CoV2 is involved directly
with virus infection as it is involved in receptor recognition, attachment, binding and
entry [5-7]. Sequence analyses of the spike protein can give us a plethora of
information which can be instrumental in drug and vaccine development. In the present
piece of work, we retrieved S protein sequences of the SARS-CoV2 from different
geographical locations to identify notable features of S protein especially in Indian
isolates. These analyses include identification of mutational signatures and their
correlation with virus infection. Our analyses show unique point mutations in the spike
protein of the Indian subtypes.
Methods:
Since COVID 19 or SARS-CoV-2 started from Wuhan, China, we started our analyses
with Spike protein sequences from Wuhan. For our study we have considered all the
full-length sequences that were available in GenBank. We first compared 17 available
S protein sequences from Wuhan. Since they showed 100% sequence similarities, we
considered one of these for our further analyses. Since Italy has also been affected
aggressively by COVID-19, we included the sequence in our study. In this paper we
have focussed on COVID-19 isolates from India. Till date only two complete genomes
of Indian COVID-19 have been submitted in the database. For our sequence
alignments we have used NCBI BLAST, CLUSTAL W and CLUSTAL OMEGA. To
predict secondary structure, we have used CFSSP (Chou and Fasman secondary
structure prediction) server.
Mutprep server was used to analyse the mutation. JMol and ConSurf tools were used
to predict the structure of the proteins. PyMoL standalone software was used to

visualize the structure and understand the pattern of bonding. Further kinetics and
structure analyses were performed by the Dynemut Server and Chimera version 11.
Results and Discussion
SARS-CoV-2 sequence data is expanding rapidly in the databases as the virus
spreads worldwide. Although many sequences from various countries have been
deposited, limited full genome sequences are available from most of the countries.
This virus has infected people in various countries like China, Italy, Spain, USA,
Germany, France, United Kingdom, India and many more and the data gets updated
almost regularly by the World Health Organization (WHO). As of now, compared to
many countries, the rate of transmission is comparatively controlled in India. Although
this might be influenced by many factors like general immunity, point of entry of this
virus in the country, measures taken to contain the spread, diagnosis, data
management etc, we have used the available sequence data of Indian isolates to
understand the biology of this virus.
From India, there are only two full genome sequences submitted from the state of

and MT050493 (isolate SARS-CoV-

from these two isolates with that of Wuhan. All the 17 sequences from Wuhan that
were first aligned to check sequence variability showed 100% sequence similarity
(Figure 1).

protein sequences available in GenBank were aligned using NCBI BLASTp online tool and the multiple
sequence alignment result has been shown.

To compare the Indian isolates, we aligned the S protein sequences of these isolates
with Wuhan isolates and a sequence from Italy. While Wuhan and Italian isolates
matched completely, we found few mutations in case of Indian isolates 29 and 166 as
shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2: Multiple Sequence Alignment of Spike protein sequences of Indian, Wuhan and Italian
isolates. Spike protein sequences of Indian Isolates available in GenBank were aligned using
CLUSTAL Omega online tool with colour coding option and the multiple sequence alignment result has
been shown above. The Indian isolates having mutations have been highlighted with red boxes. The
mutations have been marked with red arrows. Panel A: Deletion mutation of Y in isolate 29. Panel B:
Substitution mutation R->I at position 407 in isolate 29. Panel C: Substitution mutation of A->V at
position 930 in isolate 166.

We observed that isolate 29 had two mutations, a deletion mutation where Y (tyrosine)
at position 144 was absent as compared to Wuhan and Italian isolates. Due to deletion
of the amino acid residues in position 144 in the protein structure there is a change in
the beta sheets (Figure 3). This alteration may change the orientation of the molecule
and also the stability of the protein itself. Ramachandran plot of this structure show
slight shifts of angle in the β sheet configuration.

On the other hand, at position 407, the same isolate had a substitution mutation of R
(Arginine) to I (Isoleucine) (R407I). The receptor binding domain or RBD of the spike
protein of SARS-CoV-2 lie between amino acids 331-524 [8]. Thus, the mutation R407I
lie in the RBD which play key role in receptor binding. Arginine is a positively charged
amino acid and Isoleucine is a hydrophobic amino acid with C-beta branch. While
positively charged amino acid could be more exposed, hydrophobic amino acids
secure themselves away from the outer aqueous environment. Since nature of these
amino acids are so different, a substitution of this nature might change the
conformation locally and can impose functional alterations i.e. with respect to receptor
interaction. To confirm this theory further, we ran a secondary structure prediction
using CFSSP server and found that while in case of Wuhan isolate, this region had
helix only (H) (Figure 4 A), in case of R407I in Indian isolate there was introduction of
sheets (E) (Figure 4B). This suggests that a change in secondary structure occurs in
case of RBD of spike protein of isolate 29 of the 2019 novel Coronavirus of India.
Tertiary structure analyses showed that there because of the mutation there is an
introduction of additional oxygen molecule to the next residue. The protein stability
score drops sharply (-4.08) and the thereby its electrostatic force. Such a condition
makes the protein flexible and might affect interaction with the receptor. Alteration to
the structure will cause shift in the hydrogen bonds and also the bond angle, two main
pre-requisite for strong interaction with the receptor. The hydrogen potential tends to
increase from 10 to 13.2 in case of mutation.
For the isolate 166 of India, we found a different mutation at position 930 of the spike
protein (Figure 2C). Here there was a substitution of A (alanine) to V (valine) at position
930 (A930V). Since both the amino acids are hydrophobic in nature, any change that
might occur due to this mutation might get masked upon tertiary structure formation

and thus not imposing a functional change in the protein i.e. a conservative mutation.
Despite this possibility, valine has some unique characteristics. Valine is one of the Cbeta branched amino acids like threonine and isoleucine. C beta branched amino
acids are bulkier towards the main chain and it is difficult for them to attain alpha helical
conformations. Such amino acids have restricted conformations, are destabilizing in
nature causing distortion in local helix backbone [9]. S protein if SARS-CoV2 has two
domains: S1 and S2 [8]. While S1 has the RBD and in involved in receptor binding,
S2 mediates fusion of viral and host cell membranes. Mutation A930V of Indian isolate
166 falls in the S2 subunit of S protein. Considering the nature of valine being
destabilizing causing distortion, this mutation might have implications in viral
membrane fusion subject to validation. Structure of the spike glycoprotein was
retrieved from the protein data bank (PDB ID: 6VXX) (Figure 5). The residue alanine
at position 930 though not associated with the active site of the molecule stabilizes
majority of the chain A moiety in the protein due to its hydrophobic nature. On
substitution with Valine in the same position, it can potentially change the affinity of
the molecule towards its receptor.
Thus, taken together the mutations in S protein of Indian isolates can potentially alter
virus entry and thus determine the infectivity of the virus. More sequence information
along with mutational studies on receptor virus binding will further help strengthen this
observation. The sites of mutation, geographic location, frequency of such mutations,
knowledge about progression of infection and disease severities will help correlating
the significance of these mutation with respect to virus evolution and virulence. Such
information will further help in strategic designing of drug targets.
