Abstract
The ongoing pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious
disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2). We
have performed an integrated sequence-based analysis of SARS-CoV2 genomes from
different geographical locations in order to identify its unique features absent in
SARS-CoV and other related coronavirus family genomes, conferring unique infection,
facilitation of transmission, virulence and immunogenic features to the virus. The
phylogeny of the genomes yields some interesting results. Systematic gene level
mutational analysis of the genomes has enabled us to identify several unique features of
the SARS-CoV2 genome, which includes a unique mutation in the spike surface
glycoprotein (A930V (24351C>T)) in the Indian SARS-CoV2, absent in other strains
studied here. We have also predicted the impact of the mutations in the spike
glycoprotein function and stability, using computational approach. To gain further
insights into host responses to viral infection, we predict that antiviral host-miRNAs
may be controlling the viral pathogenesis. Our analysis reveals nine host miRNAs
which can potentially target SARS-CoV2 genes. Interestingly, the nine miRNAs do not
have targets in SARS and MERS genomes. Also, hsa-miR-27b is the only unique
miRNA which has a target gene in the Indian SARS-CoV2 genome. We also predicted
immune epitopes in the genomes
Introduction
The first case of COVID-19 patient was reported in December 2019 at Wuhan (China)
and then it has spread worldwide to become a pandemic, with maximum death cases in
Italy, though initiallythe maximum mortality was reported from China (1). According
to a WHO report, as on 18th March 2020 there were confirmed 209, 839 COVID-19
cases and 8778 cases of deaths, that includes cases which were locally transmitted or
imported(2). There are published reports which suggests that SARS-CoV2 shares
highest similarity with bat SARS-CoV. Scientists across the globe are trying to
elucidate the genome characteristics using phylogenetic, structural and mutational

analysis. Recent paper identified specific mutations in receptor binding domain (RBD)
domain of spike protein which is most variable part in coronavirus genome(3).
There are more than 400 SARS-CoV2 assembled genomes available at NCBI database.
Sequence analysis of the genomes can give us plethora of information which can of use
for drug development and vaccine development research attempts. In the current work
we collected SARS-CoV2 genomes from different geographical origins mainly from
India, Italy, USA, Nepal and Wuhan to identify notable genomic features of
SARS-CoV2 by integrated analysis. These analyses include identification of notable
mutational signatures, host antiviral-miRNA identification and epitope prediction.
As a host defense mechanism, a repertoire of host miRNAs also target invading viruses.
We followed the parameters used in various anti-viral miRNA databases to predict host
anti-viral miRNAs against SARS-CoV2. Our analysis shows unique host-miRNAs
targeting SARS-CoV2 virus genes.
Methodology
Genome sequences retrieval
Genome sequences of SARS-CoV2 genomes from India, Italy, USA, Wuhan, Nepal,
SARS-COV and MERS; with genome NCBI-IDs MT050493.1, MT066156.1,
MN985325.1, NC_045512.2, MT072688.1, NC_004718.3 and KC164505.2,
respectively, were retrieved from NCBI genome database. SARS-CoV2 genomes from
India, Italy, USA, Nepal along with SARS-CoV and MERS were used as query
genomes to compare with Wuhan SARS-CoV2 genome. Genes and protein sequences
of SARS-CoV2 were retrieved from ViPR database(4).
Coronavirus subtyping and Mutation Analysis
All assembled query genomes in FASTA format were analyzed using Genome
Detective Coronavirus Typing Tool (version 1.1.3)(5) which allows quick
identification and characterization of novel coronavirus genomes. The tool allows
submission of up to 2000 sequences and performs analysis within few minutes. This
tool has been validated in classification of novel SARS-CoV2 among other coronavirus
species (Figure 1 (a)). The tool identifies mutations for each gene of query genomes i.e.

SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV2 (India), SARS-CoV2 (Italy), SARS-CoV2 (USA) with
respect to Wuhan (China) SAR-CoV2. MSA was performed using online
CLUSTAL-OMEGA software.

Phylogenetic and Gene Ontology (GO) analysis
To understand the variation in genomes from various geographical areas used in the
study, we performed a phylogenetic analysis. Neighbor joining method with bootstrap
value of 1000 replicates was used for the construction of consensus tree using MEGA
software(6) (10.1.7 version). CELLO2GO (7)server was used to infer biological
function for each protein of SARS-CoV2 genome with their localization prediction.
The mutations reported in literature(3)were catalogued and evaluated for pathogenicity.
We used MutPred(8)server to identify disease associated amino acid substitution from
neutral substitution, with a p-value of >=0.05. In order to assess the impact of SNPs on
protein stability, we used two machine learning based prediction methods. The first
method, I-MUTANT server(9) was used to predict stability of the protein sequences at
pH 7.0 and temperature 25˚C. The second prediction method is MuPro(10) server, the
predictions with the former method helps in getting a consensus prediction.
Prediction of anti-viral host miRNAs

To predict host miRNAs targeting the virus, we collected a list of experimentally
verified antiviral miRNAs with their targets from VIRmiRNA database(11). Only these
host miRNAs were processed for downstream analysis. (Figure 1(b))
To identify potential host microRNA target sites in the virus genome sequences, we
have used miRanda (3.3 a version)(12, 13) software, with an energy threshold of -20
kcal/mol. We also used psRNATarget server to compare the predicted targets by the
two methods(14).
Immunogenic properties analysis
All the genes and protein sequences for SARS-CoV2 were retrieved from ViPR
database. To identify CTL and B-cell epitopes we have used CTLpred(15),
ABCpred(16) servers with default parameters. CHEMOpred(17)and Vaxijen server
(18) were used to predict chemokines and protective probable antigen, respectively
(Figure 1(c)).
Results
Phylogenetic analysis
Assembled SARS-CoV2 genomes sequences in FASTA format from India, USA,
China, Italy and Nepal used for coronavirus typing tool analysis. Using the tool, we
were able to locate query SARS-CoV genomes with known SARS-CoV2 to obtain a
cladogram for evolutionary analysis as shown in Figure 2. As expected and depicted
clearly from the figure, all the SARS-CoV2 genomes are under SARS-CoV2 clade.

Genome variation Analysis
From the variation analysis using Genome Detective Coronavirus Subtyping tool, it is
found that SARS-CoV2 shares 79.5772 % nucleotide and 83.3672 % amino acid
identity with SARS-CoV genome.
The 17% variation in the genomes corresponds to mutations in each protein, including
the spike surface glycoprotein, NSP proteins, envelope proteins and the other
SARs-CoV proteins (Table S1). We have observed that there are 27, 27, 24 and 17
deletions in orf1ab, orf1a, spike surface glycoprotein and ORF8 (Table1).

Spike surface glycoprotein Mutation and functional Analysis
Several mutations are revealed when SAR-CoV2 and SARS-CoV spike glycoproteins
are compared. Six frameshift mutations and 1 insertion in the genome that corresponds
to S13_Q14insSDLD (21601_21602insAGTGACCTTGAC) (Table S1) was also
revealed. We also observed that there are several mutations located in the regions
associated with high immune response (Table S2). These mutations might have
significant impact on the antigenic and immunogenic changes, unique to the viruses
studied here.
From the sequence alignment we observed that there are mutations in the RBD domain
which includes L455Y, F486L, Q493N, S494D and N501T, recently reported by
Kristian G. Andersen et. al(3). A better understanding of the impact of these mutations
on protein function and stability is revealed by MutPred, I-Mutant and MuPro analysis.

From SNPs analysis we observed that all the mutations might bring about decrease in
stability without changing their properties i.e. hydrophobicity to hydrophilicity or vice
versa. L455Y mutation predicted to altered Ordered interface, Disordered interface

It is known, and also confirmed by Gene ontology analysis that the protein is involved
in pathogenesis, membrane organization, reproduction, symbiosis, encompassing

Table 2: Predicted effect of reported mutations on protein function and stability
using various prediction methods.
To understand the variations that are occurring with the geographical area we have
analyzed Indian, Italian, USA, Nepal SARS-CoV2 genomes (query genomes)
compared with Wuhan SARS-CoV2 genome. It was observed that all the genomes
shares ~99% similarity with Wuhan (SARS-CoV2) genome. However, interestingly we
also observed that each genome has unique mutations- except the genome from Nepal
which shares 100% similarity with the Wuhan genome.
We found that Indian SARS-CoV2 have mutations in orf1ab, nsp2, nsp3, helicase,
ORF8 protein and spike surface glycoprotein (Table 3). Spike glycoprotein multiple
sequence alignment (S. Figure1) with SARS-CoV2(India), SARS-CoV2 (China,
Wuhan) and SARS-Cov(2003) clearly shows the replacement of A to V (24351C>T) at
930 position which are absent in other query genomes namely Italy, USA and Nepal
along with SARS-CoV (Table 3). I296V, P1261L and T214I mutations in NSP2, NSP3
and helicase are specific to India SARS-CoV2.
While comparing SARS-CoV2 sequence from Italy with that of Wuhan SARS-CoV2,
we observed 3 deletions at 3606th and 37th position which correspond to orf1ab and
NSP6 protein (Table 3). There is only one mutation, L84S (28144T>C) in ORF8
protein was detected in USA SARS-CoV2 depicting exact similarity with the Wuhan
SARS-CoV2.

Table 3: Comparative of SAR-CoV2 genomes variations
We have identified 9 miRNAs predicted to specifically target SARS-CoV2 genes. The
miRNA targets are absent in SARS and MERS genomes. The miRNAs are hsa-let-7a,
hsa-miR101, hsa-miR125a-5p, hsa-miR126, hsa-miR222, hsa-miR23b, hsa-miR378,
hsa-miR380-5 and hsa-miR98 which target the SARS-CoV2 genome. These were
reported to be targeting Hepatitis C, Herpes simplex virus 1, Hepatitis B, Influenza A,
Enterovirus 71 and Vesicular stomatitis virus. The miRNA viral targets predicted by
miRanda includes IFN-B, ATP5B, ERBB2, PB2, PA, NS1, NP, VP1 genes.
PsRNATarget analysis based on the complementary matching between the sRNA
sequence and target mRNA sequence with predefined scoring schema identified 6
miRNAs out of the 9 identified miRNAs to target SARS-CoV2 genes. The 6
miRNAsare predicted to act on the viral genomes by cleaving their target sites (Table
4).
Intriguingly, our analysis (S. Figure 2) revealed that there is only a single host miRNA
(hsa-miR-27b) uniquely targeting the India SARS-CoV2.Strikingly, the hsa-miR-27b
has been linked to target host IFN-gamma signaling pathways in certain viral
infections. Studies on SARS-CoV (30,31) shows that Interferon-beta and
interferon-gamma synergistically inhibit the replication of severe acute respiratory
syndrome-associated coronavirus. Interestingly, 52 host miRNAs were predicted to

have same targets in all the SARS-CoV2 genomes (Wuhan, Italy and USA), except an
extra miRNA uniquely targeting Indian genome. Further, we also identified host

Discussion and conclusion
We have used bioinformatics tools to investigate SARS-CoV2 sequences from
different geographical locations. The Phylogenetic analysis of the genomes, the
nucleotide sequence diversity analysis of the genomes, the predicted antiviral host
miRNAs specific to the genomes and the prediction of immune active sequences in the
genomes have yielded some interesting facts, including unique features.
For the phylogenetic analysis, we compared the sequences of 6 SARS-CoV2 isolates
from different countries namely, Wuhan, India, Italy, USA and Nepal along with other

corona virus species (Figure 1). As reported earlier too(19, 20), the virus from Wuhan
showed higher similarity with SARS-CoV. There was no phylogenetic segregation of
the genomes based on geographic origin, whether from the same continent or a
neighboring country (Figure 1) but, ambiguously showing varied clustering like Italy
and Nepal clustered together, followed by India and USA. This reiterates the findings
indicating the massive exchange and importation of the carriers between the epicenter
Wuhan and these countries. However, a detail analysis, complemented with more
sequences and patient met data will give further evolutionary insights regarding the fast
spreading pandemic.
Genomic comparison
The phylogenetics heterogeneity between different strains is explored by genome
variation profiling to find alterations in genetic information during the course of
evolution, outbreak, and clinical spectrum caused by the different strains. In case of
SARS-CoV2 and SARS-CoV too, few clinical characteristics differentiate them among
themselves and with other seasonal influenza infections as well, as reported recently
(21). Interestingly in the present analysis, in comparison to SARS-CoV, we observed at
least one of the variations like indels, deletions, misaligned and frameshift in all the
SARS-CoV2 proteins except ORF6, ORF10 and ORF14 (Table S1).
The spread and containment of the SARS-CoV2 outbreak is varying among different
countries (https://www.gisaid.org/). Amongst other factors, sequence of the host
invasion factors of the virus strain may possibly play an important role in degree of
transmission, virulence and pathogenicity of the virus. Therefore, we set out to
investigate the genetic variations present in the spike surface glycoprotein (S) which
plays a significant role in binding of the virus to the host cell, and determining host
tropism and pathogenicity(22). Going well with the expectations from a rapidly
transmitting pandemic virus, in our analysis, we observed various mutations located in
the regions associated with immune response (Table S2). These mutations may have
significant impact on the antigenic and immunogenic changes responsible for
differences in the severity of the outbreak in different geographical regions.

To gain further insights, we compared the genetic mutation spectrum identified in the
four countries, namely USA, Italy, India and Nepal. Surprisingly, the mutation
spectrums were different among these countries (Table 3). While sequence from Nepal
showed no variations, the maximum number of mutations were identified in Indian
sequence- located in ORF1ab, nsp2, nsp3, helicase, ORF8 protein and spike surface
glycoprotein (Table3). Probably presence of the unique mutations identified in the
genome from Italy are responsible for the sudden upsurge in the number of affected
cases and deaths (2), combined with other factors- a speculation which maybe verified
with more evidences. From this analysis, we also speculate that the presence of country
specific mutation spectrum may also be able to explain the current scenario in these
countries like severity of illness, containment of the outbreak, the extent and timing of
exposures to a symptomatic carrier etc.
Non-structural proteins have their specific roles in replication and transcription (23).
Previous studies on SARS-CoV revealed Nsp15 as a potential candidate for the
therapeutic target(24). It is noteworthy to mention that in the present study; various
mutations have been identified in all the non-structural proteins suggesting them to be
an important and potential player in proposing therapeutic targets and should be
explored experimentally.
Many studies have reported that miRNAs not only act as the signature of tissue
expression and function but also as potential biomarkers playing important role in
regulating disease pathophysiology(25). In viral infections, host antiviral miRNAs play
a crucial role in the regulation of immune response to virus infection depending upon
the viral agent. Many known human miRNAs appear to be able to target viral genes and
their functions like interfering with replication, translation and expression.
In the present study, we tried to predict the antiviral host- miRNAs specific for
SARS-CoV2.Firstly, we compared SARS-CoV2 and SARS-CoV and identified a list
of 6 miRNAs unique to SARS-CoV2 and previously reported to be associated with
other virus diseases, including HIV (Table. 4).

Clinical investigations have suggested that patients with cardiac diseases, hypertension,
or diabetes, who are treated with ACE2- increasing drugs including inhibitors and
blockers show increased expression of ACE2 and thus are at higher risk of getting the
SARS-CoV2 infection (26). Also there are studies on the regulatory role of miRNA
hsa-mir-27b-3p described in ACE2 Signaling (27). The results of the present study
suggest a strong correlation between miRNA hsa-mir-27b-3p and ACE2 which needs
to be confirmed experimentally in SARS-CoV2 cases.
Further, we tried to compare the miRNAs in the genomes and observed some striking
findings. We observed that out of all the miRNAs, hsa-miR-27b is the only unique
miRNA specific to India SARS-CoV2 and showed no significant
complementarity-based nucleotide-binding with the strain of SARS-CoV2 from other
countries. This is surprising and is of utmost importance along with our other novel
finding of a unique mutation identified in the spike surface glycoprotein (A930V
(24351C>T)) in the Indian sequence. The target of the hsa-miR-27b sequence is the
location containing A930V mutation in the spike surface glycoprotein which perhaps,
should be explored further, experimentally. Reports have demonstrated the ability of
miR-27b to inhibit HIV-1 replication (28). There are contradicting reports regarding
the use of HIV antiviral regimen for SARS-CoV2 infection showing no effects in China
(29) while the Indian Council of Medical Research (India) has given the guidelines for
the use of HIV treatment in these cases as some of the patients showed improvement
with the administration. A few other drugs, including FDA approved antiviral and
antimalarials are being used with significant claimed-successes. Needless to say, the
variation in the protein sequences may have some influence on the therapeutic effects
of these drugs.
Based on our analysis, we speculate an important regulatory role of miR-27b in
SARS-CoV2 infection. The contradictory treatment outcomes may be due to the
presence of the miR-27b target in the Indian genome specifically. It probably indicates

that the specific genetic and miRNA spectrum should be considered as the basis of the
treatment management.
The findings in the study have revealed unique features of the SARS-CoV2 genomes,
which may be explored further. For example, one may analyse the link between
severity of diseases to each of the variants, expression of the predicted host antiviral
miRNAs can be checked in the patients, the predicted epitopes may be explored for
their immunogenicity, difference in treatment outcomes may also be correlated with
genome variations, lastly the potential of the unique segments of the virus proteins and
the unique host miRNAs may be explored in development of novel antiviral therapies.
