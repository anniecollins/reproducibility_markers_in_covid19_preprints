Abstract: The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) spike protein is a smart molecular machine that
instigates the entry of coronavirus to the host cell causing the COVID-19 pandemic. In this
study, a structural-topology based model Hamiltonian of C3 symmetric trimeric spike is
developed to explore its complete conformational energy landscape using molecular dynamic
simulations. The study finds 2019-nCoV to adopt a unique strategy by undertaking a dynamic
conformational asymmetry induced by a few unique inter-chain interactions. This results in two
prevalent asymmetric structures of spike where one or two spike heads lifted up undergoing a
dynamic transition likely to enhance rapid recognition of the host-cell receptor turning on its
high-infectivity. The crucial interactions identified in this study are anticipated to potentially
affect the efficacy of therapeutic targets.

One Sentence Summary: Inter-chain-interaction driven rapid symmetry breaking strategy
adopted by the prefusion trimeric spike protein likely to make 2019-nCoV highly infective.
We are in the midst of a global catastrophic situation due to coronavirus outbreak where
every day the global death toll is biting the past count. While history has witnessed past
pandemics (1-3), 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) trends to outcompete them all by its
rapid transmission in a short period to win the crown. As the name 'corona' (in Latin, it means
crown), the accused of the outbreak makes use of a 'crown-shaped' molecular machine, the
trimeric spike-protein to drive the virus entry into the host cells. 2019-nCoV is the newest
addition of betacoronavirus genus (4). While the sequence and structural similarity to the severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus spike (SARS-CoV S) repute the identity of 2019-nCoV
spike as SARS-CoV-2 S (5, 6), a recent study reported that the SARS-CoV-2 S has 10-20 fold
higher affinity to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor than that of SARSCoV S (7).
The large ectodomain of the S glycoprotein of the coronavirus uses the S1 subunit for
receptor binding and the trimeric S2 stalk for host-cell membrane fusion (Fig. 1A) (8, 9). In
SAR-CoV-2 S glycoprotein, the β-sheet-rich S1 subunit comprises an N terminal domain (NTD)
and a receptor-binding domain (RBD) towards its C-terminus (CTD) (Fig. 1B). So far, static
structural characterization reported that the RBD of S1 has an intrinsic hinge-like conformational

movement that generates the 'up' and 'down' conformations (7, 8, 10). Other betacoronaviruses,
like SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and distantly related alphacoronavirus porcine epidemic diarrhea
virus (PEDV) also have this apparently stochastic RBD movement (11, 12). The combination of
RBD up-down rearrangement may lead each S1-head of the trimeric prefusion spike protein of
coronavirus to adopt different possible conformations: (i) 3down, (ii) 1up-2down, (iii) 2up1down, and (iv) 3up (Fig. 1C). Among them 3down, 3up are symmetric conformers and 1up2down, 2up-1down are asymmetric conformers. Single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (CryoEM) determined few such symmetric and asymmetric structures referred to as the receptorbinding inactive state and receptor-binding active state, respectively (8). The asymmetric
structure where one of the RBDs rotates up was thought to be less stable for SARS-CoV S (10).
In comparison, the recent Cryo-EM study found three RBDs in 1up-2down conformation as a
predominant arrangement in the prefusion state of 2019-nCoV S trimer (7). This arrangement
apparently appears legitimate for SARS-CoV-2 S in order to explain the higher affinity of 1up2down for ACE2 receptor than that of SARS-CoV S. However, we cannot rule out the possibility
of 2up-1down conformation as a functional state, which may provide even stronger binding with
ACE2 considering the fact that ACE2 is a dimeric receptor (9, 13). This hypothesis is consistent
with a recent crystallographic study demonstrating that CR3022, a neutralizing antibody isolated
from convalescent SARS patients targets the RBD when at least two RBD on the trimeric spike
protein are in the up conformation (14). Assembling all these experimental results it is high time
to understand the molecular mechanism of S1-head coordination of trimeric SAR-CoV-2 S and
to identify important interaction in regulating spike up-down conformations.

A major challenge was simulating the gigantic structure of the full-length trimeric spike,
as it is associated with the largescale conformational transition. It is indeed a daunting task to
explore the full conformational landscape at an atomic length-scale. To overcome this, a
structure-based coarse-grained molecular dynamic simulation approach has been adopted (15).
The simulation started with a full-length homo-trimeric spike protein structure generated from
homology modeling which involves the alignment of a target sequence and a template structure
(pdb: 6vsb) (7, 16). This also helped to build the missing loops. The domain-specific residuerange for the full-length, trimeric SARS-CoV-2 S is given in Fig. 2A. The S1 head coordination
of the trimeric spike is programmed by developing a super-symmetric topology-based modeling
framework (Fig. 2B) (described in the Method pipeline in the supplementary material). With this,
the molecular machine is ready to swing each of its S1 head between its 'up' and 'down'
conformations (Movie S1, S2). A number of Cryo-EM structures captured the 'up' and 'down'
conformations of the RBD domain of spike proteins of other coronaviruses including SARSCoV-2 where the S1 subunit undergoes a hinge-like conformational movement prerequisite for
receptor binding (Fig. 2C) (7, 8, 10, 17). Apart from the hinge-responsive RBD-cleft interaction,
in this study, a few inter-chain interactions are found to assist the 'RBD-up' and the 'RBD-down'
conformations (shown in Fig. 2D and 2E, Movie S3). These few interactions are identified to
impact the breathing of RBD of SARS-CoV-2 S. This makes the early referred 'RBD-up/down'
conformations slightly different from the 'S1-head-up/down' conformation for trimeric SARSCoV-2 S as the former is regulated only by intra-chain interactions while the latter is regulated
by both intra and inter-chain interactions (Fig. S1). After identifying all these unique intra and
inter-chain contacts (18, 19) extracted from the corresponding 'S1-head-up' and 'S1-head-down'
conformations, a super-symmetric contact map is generated. This follows the development of a
structure-based model Hamiltonian (Materials and Methods in Supplementary) which is based on
the energy landscape theory of protein folding (20-24). This approach not only potentiates the
trimeric spike to adopt C3 symmetric '3up' and '3down' states but also to break the symmetry in a
thermodynamically governed way (Fig. S1-S4) (25, 26).

To monitor the transition between the 'S1-head-up' and the 'S1-head-down' states for each
monomer with the trimeric interactions, a large pool of unbiased longtime trajectories generated
where multiple occurrences of up and down states for each monomer have been sampled. We
employ a reaction coordinate, Q, the fraction of the native contact (19, 27) corresponding to the
inter-chain contacts associated with the 'S1-head-up' and the 'S1-head-down' states. A typical
trajectory plot of Q extracted from the equilibrium simulation of the trimeric prefusion spike
clearly shows the hopping between different conformational states as hypothesized earlier (Fig.
3A). Furthermore, the dynamic transitions between the two major asymmetric states (1up2down: QS1-head-down≈0.45 and 2up-down: QS1-head-down≈0.15) are evident in the Q-trajectory.
Analysis of all the simulations yields the 2-D free energy landscape of the trimeric spike protein
of SARS-CoV-2 (Fig 3B) with its all possible conformations. The conformations corresponding
to the minima of the free energy landscape are shown in Fig.3C. The temperature dependence of
conformational transition indicates that the configurational entropy and enthalpy compensation
results in the enhanced population of the asymmetric 1up-2down to 2up-1down conformations
(Fig S4). While the predominant population of the 1up-2down state is consistent with the recent
Cryo-EM data, (7) (Movie S1, S2) the other asymmetric structure (2up-1down) emerges as a best
binding epitope for CR3022 (an antibody collected from convalescent SARS patients) according
to a recent antibody recognition study of SARS-CoV-2 S (14).

Fig. 4: Interactions that make SARS-CoV-2 spike different from SARS-CoV and MERSCoV spike. A. Unique inter-chain interactions formed by RBD of one chain with NTD of the
adjacent chain stabilizing the S1-head-up conformation in SARS-CoV-2 S (pdb:6vsb). Interchain domain closure is analyzed by inter-chain proline-proline distance measurement. The same
distance measured for the following spikes: B. SARS-CoV spike (pdb:5x5b) and C. MERS-CoV
spike (pdb: 5x5f). D. RBD up-down hinge dynamics triggered by inter-chain RBD-NTD domain
interaction. E. In the absence of RBD-NTD inter-chain interaction, the hinge motion of RBD is
hindered by populating more 'RBD-down' conformations and allows to sample 'RBD-up'
conformation only rarely in a stochastic manner.

In this study, sequence and interaction level (Fig. S5, Fig. S1) comparison has been made
over the Cryo-EM structure of SARS-CoV-2 S (pdb: 6vsb), SARS-CoV S (pdb:5x5b) and
MERS-CoV S (pdb: 5x5f)(7, 12). This comparison results that SARS-CoV-2 S has NTD-RBD
domain association where a proline residue of ChainA forms CH-п type interaction with the
tyrosine residue (28) and hydrophobic interaction with another proline of ChainB (Fig. 4A, Fig.

S1). Inter-chain proline-proline distance measurement shows that the corresponding RBD-NTD
domains are far away in the case of SARS-CoV S (Fig. 4B) and further away in the case of
MERS-CoVS (Fig. 4C). This measurement involves their respective Cryo-EM structures.
Despite the relatively high degree of sequence similarity between the SARS-CoV-2 S and the
SARS-CoV S and also with the spike protein from the bat coronavirus RaTG13, a single
histidine residue at the relevant RBD-NTD domain interface is found unique in the vase of
SARS-CoV-2 S (Fig. S5) (29). The imidazole ring of histidine is pointing towards the
hydrophobic assembly of aforesaid proline-tyrosine in the juxtaposition of the RBD-S1 hinge
region. Such inter-chain RBD-NTD connection is thus found to impact the RBD hinge
interaction by upregulating more RBD-up conformation (Fig. 4D). In the absence of such interchain interaction, the RBD mostly stays in the down conformation allowing RBD to break the
symmetry rarely in a stochastic manner (Fig. 4E). The absence of inter-chain RBD-NTD
connection also appears to impact the SARS-CoV RBD hinge interaction. Here, the opening of
RBD-S1 cleft is significantly less than that of SARS-CoV-2 S in their respective S1-head-up
state (Fig. S6). The assistance from the inter-chain RBD-S2-stalk related interfacial contacts are
also found to modulate the population dynamics of RBD-down conformation (Fig. S7). The
influence of this inter-chain RBD-S2-stalk interaction has also been observed in an early CryoEM analyses where two proline mutations at the top of S2 stalk (inferring RBD-S2 inter-chain
connection) helped to stabilize the 'up' conformers of SARS-CoV S (30).
The synergy between internal RBD-hinge interactions and inter-chain interactions allows
trimeric SARS-CoV-2 S to adopt a unique dynamical feature than other corona-virus spikes. It
appears that the inter-chain interactions driven rapid symmetry breaking strategy potentiates this
spike machine to turn on its high-infectivity. The energy landscape framework used in this study
indeed helps to unify and compare different spike protein interactions present in other
coronaviruses. While in the current situation to develop diagnostics and antiviral therapies are of
utmost priority, the present structure-based model derived information at the microscopic
interaction level might provide deep insight to design effective decoys or antibodies to fight
against 2019-nCoV infection.

Method pipeline of building a super-symmetric contact map of SARS-CoV-2 prefusion
spike protein.

Super-symmetric contact map generation method:
Coarse-grained structure-based simulations have been performed for full-length trimetric SARSCoV-2 spike protein. The structure-based Hamiltonians for different simulations were derived
after processing the recent Cryo-EM structure (pdb:6vsb) thorough the Swiss Model to complete
missing loops present in the structure (7, 16). This generates a homo-trimeric SARS-CoV-2
spike where this initial structure has important components in terms of intra and inter-chain
contacts (interaction) leading to an 'S1-head-up' and an 'S1-head-down' conformation for each
protomer. In this prevalent trimeric variant, only one monomer adopts 'S1-head-up' and the same

of the other two adopts the 'S1-head-down' conformation. Few characteristic intra-chain contacts
cause the receptor-binding domain to perform a hinge-motion resulting 'RBD-up' and 'RBDdown' conformations for each monomer. Intra-chain contact-pair list is generated separately from
ChainA which is a representative of the RBD-up conformation as well as from ChainB which is
a representative of the RBD-down conformation. To avoid over-counting the contact-pairs of

 

ChainA and ChainB are compared. Only unique contacts related to RBD-up Cup and RBDdown  Cdown  conformations and a set of shared contacts  Cshared  are considered as shown in the
pipeline method. This set of {C up , C down , C shared } is symmetrically distributed over all chains
making each of them dynamically capable of sampling both RBD-up and RBD-down
conformations driven by C intra as defined in the pipeline method. Contact calculation is performed
using the Shadow criterion (19).
Interesting components are inter-chain contacts residing at the interface of the dimer. Now, two
categories of interactive dimeric interfaces are there: asymmetric-dimer interface and symmetricdimer interface. ChainA (S1-head-up) and the adjacent ChainB (S1-head-down) represent an
asymmetric dimer unit. Similarly, ChainB (S1-head-down) and the adjacent ChainC (S1-headdown) represent a symmetric dimer unit. At the asymmetric-dimer interface, the RBD-domain of
ChainA forms a few unique contacts with the NTD domain of the adjacent ChainB as shown in
Fig. 2D mostly ensuring the S1-head-up arrangement. This asymmetric-dimer also includes a
relatively remote RBD(B)-S2(A) contacts (Fig. 2E) that can bend down the S1-head of a chain
only partially. All these dimeric interfacial contacts are unique and identified as C AB . Similarly,
in the asymmetric-dimer interface, the RBD-domain of ChainB forms a few unique contacts with
the S2 domain of the adjacent ChainC as shown in Fig. 2E. These contacts can bend down the
S1-head of a chain only partially. In trimeric spike, RBD(B)-S2(A) is equivalent to RBD(A)S2(C) and RBD(C)-S2(B) following the cyclic rule. Our analysis shows that the complete bentdown of S1-head resulting in the S1-head-down conformation is collectively determined by
RBD(A)-S2(B), RBD(A)-S2(C) type of contact elements along with intra-chain hinge contact.
Finally, interface-related contact set {C AB , C BC } has been cycled over all the interfaces making
each of interfaces dynamically capable of inducing S1-head movement.

Developing a structure-based Hamiltonian of trimeric spike protein simulation:
A structure-based Hamiltonian of trimeric spike protein for SAR-CoV2 is derived using the
super-symmetric contact map. In the current structure-based model amino acids are represented
by single beads at the location of the C-α atom (15, 25, 31, 32). The coarse-grained structurebased model, a well-established model, comprehends a novel way to investigate the mechanisms
associated with protein folding and function (20-22, 24, 33-38). In the current context of
decoding virus entry mechanism, this model successfully characterized Class-I viral fusion
protein dynamics including conformational rearrangement of a viral surface glycoprotein,
influenza hemagglutinin (HA) during its prefusion and postfusion states (26, 39).
As described in the pipeline method, the complete Hamiltonian comprises of two terms:

H intra , H inter The complete Hamiltonian as a function of a set of position coordinates r i has the

 

following simple form:

H r i  H intra  H inter

 

(Eq. S1)

Where H intra contains three symmetric terms applied over chain A, Chain B and Chain C to
maintain their internal local and non-local interactions.

intra

(Eq. S2)

A/B/C
The local part of Hintra includes harmonic potentials that restrain bonds ( r ), angles (  ).

Dihedral angles (  ) are treated with a cosine term, as shown in Eq. S4. The initial geometric
parameters ( ri 0 ,  i 0 ,i 0 , rij0 ) are obtained from the initial trimeric spike structure as shown in Fig
1B.

A/B/C
The first non-local term of the Hamiltonian used in H intra
represents non-bonded interaction

potential in the form of 10–12 Lennard-Jones potential that is used to describe the interactions
that stabilize the native contacts(15). A native contact is defined for a pair of residues (i and j)
present in the native state using shadow criteria and when (i−j)>3. Δij is defined in such a way
that if any i and j residues belong to Cintra , Δij = 1 turning on 10–12 Lennard-Jones potential;
otherwise Δij = 0. For all non-native pairs for which Δij = 0, a repulsive potential with σ = 4Å is
used. All the interaction coefficients used in this potential are given in Table S1.
As described in the method pipeline, H inter will include only the non-local inter-chain contacts
residing at the interface of the dimer which comprises of accounting for asymmetric-dimer
interfacial contacts Casym and symmetric-dimer interfacial contacts Csym those are symmetrized
for all AB, BC, CA dimeric interfaces.

Equilibrium Simulation Details:
To begin every simulation an initial structure is energetically minimized under the
structure-based Hamiltonian using the steepest descent algorithm. Atomic coordinates of the
energy minimized structure have been evolved using Langevin dynamics with a time step of

0.0005  R . We used an underdamped condition for rapid sampling(40). For explicit particles,
reduced mass of 1 R and a drag coefficient 1  R1 are used to efficiently sample the

reduced temperature-dependent (T*=0.50TR, T*=0.58TR, and T*=0.83TR) analyses are shown
for clarity in Fig. S4. Population distribution as a function of the fraction of native inter-chain
contacts formed in the S1-head-down state is monitored over these temperatures. Four states
emerge as indicated in Fig. 3B and Fig. S4. As the temperature increases the population shifts
more towards the S1-head-up state. At T*=0.58T R the population of 1up-2down state appears as
a predominant population in the conformational landscape which correlates well with the recent
Cryo-EM data (7). We have performed all our simulations being consistent with this selected
temperature. The RMSD analyses ensure the correctness of the simulation progress and the
emergence of the correct structure (Fig. S3).
The population shifts more towards the S1-head-up state conformations as the temperature
increases. It suggests that the S1-head-up states are more dynamic and entropically stable. Note
that the dynamical transition between 1up-2down and 2up-1down states may tolerate a wide
range of temperatures by a population shift mechanism. So far, we have examined that it
tolerates the temperature range from T*=0.50T R to T*=1.67TR. Temperature dependence of
RBD hinge motion has also been studied (Fig. S4). Population distribution as a function of the
fraction of native intra-chain hinge-region contacts formed by the RBD at different temperatures
has been monitored. A bimodal distribution reflects the population of the 'RBD-up' and 'RBDdown' states for any individual chain being in trimeric spike. As temperature increases, the
RBD-up states start to enhance their populations.

Free energy calculation:
In a system, if a state “A” described by its reaction coordinate, XA (which in our case is
the fraction of native contact) is separated from another state “B” described by its reaction
coordinate, XB , by a finite barrier, the free energy of transition from A to B can be expressed as,

F ( X B )  F ( X A )   k BT ln

P( X B )
P( X A )

(Eq. S8)

where, P( X B ) is the probability to find the system in state B at the reaction coordinate, Q B. the
same holds for P( X A ) . From a finite set of unbiased simulations of trimeric spike protein, a
complete thermodynamic description is obtained. Probability distributions are obtained by
sampling the configurational space running 50 Molecular Dynamics simulation sets.

Fig. S6.The opening of RBD-S1 cleft in the 'S1-head-up' state of SARS-CoV-2 S differs
from that of SARS-CoV S. The opening is measured by a characteristic distance between a
serine and proline residues at two edges of the cleft. For SARS-CoV-2 S the distance is 2.43 nm
while for SARS-CoV-S, it is 1.65nm. It appears that inter-chain RBD-NTD connection
influences the SARS-CoV S RBD hinge motion significantly where the cleft opening is
supported by those inter-chain interactions.
