Abstract
There is currently an urgent unmet need to increase coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
testing capability to effectively respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the current
shortage in RNA extraction reagents as well as limitations in qPCR protocols have resulted in
bottlenecks in testing capacity. Herein, we describe a novel molecular diagnostic for COVID-19
based on Sanger sequencing. This assay uses the addition of a frame-shifted spike-in, a
modified PCR master mix, and custom Sanger sequencing data analysis to detect and quantify
SARS-CoV-2 RNA at a limit of detection comparable to existing qPCR-based assays, at 10-20
genome copy equivalents. Crucially, our assay was able to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA from viral
particles suspended in transport media that was directly added to the PCR master mix,
suggesting that RNA extraction can be skipped entirely without any degradation of test
performance. Since Sanger sequencing instruments are widespread in clinical laboratories and
commonly have built-in liquid handling automation to support up to 3840 samples per instrument
per day, the widespread adoption of qSanger COVID-19 diagnostics can unlock more than
1,000,000 tests per day in the US.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; COVID-19) is a public health emergency of international concern.
This virus first emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019 [1], and spread to over 160
countries [2]. As of April 6, 2020, more than 1.3 million individuals are infected and over 70,000
deaths are reported [3]. One study found that undocumented infections were the infection
source for 79% of documented cases [4]. Evidence from other reports suggests that some
asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients have high levels of viral shedding [5,6]. The
substantial undocumented infection, along with the nonspecific clinical features and
uncertainties in transmissibility and virulence of SARS-CoV-2, have presented significant
challenges in containment of this virus. Until an effective vaccine or treatment is available, rapid,
accurate, and widely available diagnostic tests not only for symptomatic patients but also for
those who have come in contact with any positive cases are critical to curb the spread of the
virus. However, such tests have been in limited supply in the US and many other countries in
the world.
The backbone of COVID-19 diagnosis has been quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)
tests. The limited number of qPCR machines and the limitations of qPCR protocols, which do
not have safe stopping points or a readily automatable process, have hampered large-scale
testing. Furthermore, the sensitivity of qPCR requires specific RNA extraction reagents that are
currently in short supply. Other diagnostics for COVID-19 include blood-based immunoassays,
which are often less accurate than molecular assays and indirectly detects immune response to
COVID-19 only after symptoms appear, and CRISPR-based assays that are still in development
[7].
In this report, we describe a molecular diagnostic method for COVID-19 based on quantitative
Sanger (qSanger), a technique for reconstructing quantitative data from Sanger sequencing
chromatograms that we originally developed and validated for non-invasive prenatal testing
(NIPT) of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) [8]. The workflow of qSanger-based COVID-19 is highly similar
to traditional Sanger sequencing of reverse transcription (RT)-PCR amplicons (Fig. 1), but it
includes the addition of a frame-shifted synthetic COVID-19 spike-in DNA in the reaction master
mix. qSanger COVID-19 is designed to support one-step reverse-transcription (RT)-PCR directly
from viral transport media (VTM) of specimens, without an RNA purification step (Fig. 1A). The
amplification products are then purified and Sanger sequenced by automated capillary
electrophoresis. Synthetic DNA included in RT-PCR master mix prior to PCR amplification
serves as an internal control that enables specimens to be readily identified as either positive or
negative for COVID-19 (Fig. 1B-C). Quantitative analysis of the Sanger sequence
chromatogram gives qSanger an extremely high sensitivity and specificity for all positive results
with a limit of detection of 10-20 genome copy equivalents (GCE), equivalent to gold-standard
qPCR methods. Furthermore, the presence of a spike-in as an intra-sample control in the
qSanger assay allows for easy interpretation of results and determination of sources of error

(e.g. extraction or amplification or sequencing failure), and also allows population-level analyses
such as mutational analysis and contact tracing. In addition, the ratio of the amplitudes of
corresponding bases between the endogenous and spike-in sequences at offset positions
reflects the ratio of the molecular abundances of the two sequences. Computationally combining
the amplitude ratios of multiple corresponding bases can then be used to estimate the viral load
over a 400-fold dynamic range with Poisson-limited coefficient of variation.

Results
qSanger COVID-19 Limit of Detection is comparable to RT-qPCR
As an initial demonstration of qualitative detection of COVID-19 by qSanger, we
designed PCR primers and synthetic DNA spike-in to target SARS-CoV-2 N protein (Fig. 1B). A
one-step RT-PCR mix (NEB) containing both was used to perform reverse-transcription of
SARS-CoV-2 RNA and subsequent PCR amplification in one pot. In each RT-PCR, we added
either nuclease-free water as a no-template control (NTC) or 100-5000 GCE of synthetic
SARS-CoV-2 RNA (Twist Biosciences). All reactions also contained ~200 GCE of spike-in in the
RT-PCR master mix. After RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing, we observed a qualitatively clean
chromatogram for the spike-in sequence for the NTC condition in which no SARS-CoV-2 RNA
was added (Fig. 2A). At the 100 GCE level, the Sanger chromatogram showed clear mixed
bases corresponding to approximately equal abundance of spike-in DNA and SARS-CoV-2
RNA. At 5000 GCE SARS-CoV-2 RNA, the chromatogram exhibited a relatively pure trace for
the SARS-CoV-2 target sequence, suggesting that the SARS-CoV-2 signal overwhelmed the
spike-in signal when it was present at 50-fold greater abundance.
To determine the limit of detection of qSanger COVID-19, we performed assays on
dilutions of SARS-COV-2 RNA corresponding to 0 GCE, 10 GCE, 100 GCE, 1000 GCE, or 5000
GCE. Four replicates at each dilution were assayed by both qSanger and qPCR. As expected,
all 4 replicates of 0 GCE were negative for COVID-19 by qPCR, and addition of 10 or more
SARS-CoV-2 GCE exhibited a clear logarithmic decrease in qPCR cycle threshold (Ct) (Fig.
2B). Similarly, no SARS-CoV-2 sequence was apparent on Sanger chromatograms for the NTC
condition. No spike-in sequence was qualitatively discernable at the 5000 GCE dilution. Mixed
bases were obviously present for both the 10 GCE and 100 GCE conditions ​suggesting that the
limit of detection is about 10 GCE SARS-CoV-2.
We developed custom bioinformatic analyses to extract the relative abundance of
SARS-CoV-2 and spike-in amplified products from Sanger chromatograms and automate
analysis of qSanger chromatograms (see Methods). Briefly, peak amplitudes were assigned to
either the spike-in or SARS-CoV-2 sequence at each base position, and a linear regression
analysis was performed to determine the qSanger ratio between SARS-CoV-2 and spike-in
trace intensities. qSanger ratios near 0 were recovered in the samples with 0 GCE, indicating
the complete absence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. (Fig. 1C). Since all of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA at 10

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.07.029199; this version posted April 10, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

GCE or qSanger ratios of 3% or greater, this provided further evidence that the limit of detection
of qSanger COVID-19 is ~10 GCE or fewer. Quantitative analysis of chromatogram peak
heights was able to recover a qSanger ratio for even the 5000 GCE condition, and the qSanger
ratios had excellent linearity over 10-5000 GCE (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, qSanger ratios were in
good agreement qPCR Ct values (Fig. 2D).

qSanger detects SARS-CoV-2 RNA when amplified directly from viral particles in
transport medium without RNA purification.
Since a major limitation for increasing testing capacity has been supply chain and lab workflow
bottlenecks related to RNA extraction, we next attempted to detect SARS-CoV-2 directly from
the specimen matrix (viral transport medium). There has been a previous report that RT-qPCR
can be successfully performed when up to 3-7ul (total reaction volume of 20ul) of VTM without
extraction is used as the template for RT-PCR [9]. We hypothesized that qSanger could be a
more reliable method for detection of COVID-19 without RNA extraction because of ​i.​ increased
robustness against PCR inhibitors in the specimen matrix since quantification of SARS-CoV-2 is
performed via comparison with the spike-in internally control; ​ii. an improved limit of detection by
adding more VTM to a correspondingly larger reaction size; and, ​iii. a
​ voidance of false-positives
by examining sequencing data for the correct spike-in or SARS-CoV-2 sequence. To test this
hypothesis, we obtained reference materials in which either SARS-CoV-2 (positive control) or
human RNA (negative control) is packaged inside of viral particles and suspended in VTM
(Seracare). Since polymerase mixes can have varying resiliency to PCR inhibitors, we also
evaluated both Luna RT-qPCR and OneTaq RT-PCR kits.
For both Seracare negative and positive control specimens, eight replicates each were
performed on the cross-product of conditions for Luna vs OneTaq polymerases and direct VTM
vs purified RNA, for 64 reactions total. 25ul of the Seracare specimen (corresponding to 125
GCE) was added to a 100ul total reaction volume. Additionally, 16 replicates of no-template
controls were performed for each polymerase wherein nuclease free water was added to the
reaction. All 32 NTC samples across all conditions were negative by qSanger assay and
analysis (Fig. 3A). Nearly all Seracare negative control samples were determined to be negative
by qSanger; indeterminate results were obtained from 2 purified RNA Luna specimens and 1
purified OneTaq specimen. All Seracare positive controls were identified by qSanger except for
a OneTaq direct VTM specimen (Fig. 3A). Samples were classified as undetermined due to low
chromatogram signal intensity (Signal to noise ratio < 500) or lack of sequence alignment.
Possible reasons for undetermined chromatograms could be failure in RNA extraction, PCR
amplification, or cycle sequencing. Since the majority of undetermined specimens used purified
RNA, the possibility that the majority of assay failures were due to the RNA extraction process
itself, perhaps by carryover of high salt buffers, should be considered.
To further evaluate the feasibility of a direct VTM, extraction-free method for Sars-CoV-2
detection, we also examined the ability of qSanger to quantify the amount of viral particles in the

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.07.029199; this version posted April 10, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

Seracare positive control specimens (Fig. 3B). Since each reaction contained 125 GCE of
Sars-CoV-2 and 200 GCE of spike-in, we expected to measure a qSanger ratio of 0.625. The
OneTaq results yielded a qSanger ratio consistently around 2-3.5. This discrepancy could be
due to a slightly more efficient amplification of the SARS-CoV-2 sequence compared to spike-in
sequence. Remarkably, Luna polymerase mix yielded a qSanger ratio of 0.74 +/- 0.04 s.e.m. for
VTM and a qSanger ratio of 0.97 +/- 0.04 s.e.m. for purified RNA, which is very close to the
expected ratio. The ~20% difference is on par with typical imprecisions for pipetting and DNA
quantification. The coefficient of variation (CV) for the VTM and RNA purified Luna assays were
12% and 16%, respectively. Notably, this is in good agreement with the imprecision associated
with measuring ~125 molecules at the Poisson limit. Since Luna exhibited better accuracy and
precision compared to OneTaq, and the Luna direct VTM method resulted in correct calls for all
NTC, Seracare positive, and negative specimens without any failed reactions, subsequent
experiments were performed with Luna polymerase mix.
Finally, we sought to demonstrate that omitting RNA extraction does not adversely affect
qSanger sensitivity. We added 20 GCE (corresponding to 2x the LOD in Fig. 1) of viral particles
in VTM containing either negative control or SARS-CoV-2 RNA (Fig. 4). Sanger chromatograms
clearly showed the absence and presence of SARS-CoV-2 signal in the negative and positive
controls, respectively (Fig. 4A). The qSanger assay correctly identified the negative and positive
samples in 39 out of the 40 samples tested, with 1 negative control specimen returning an
undetermined result due to sequencing failure (Fig. 4B). Overall, the excellent performance
shown by our qSanger results on unextracted VTM vs. purified RNA with respect to absolute
quantification accuracy, Poisson-limited coefficient of variation, and limit of detection that is
comparable to gold-standard RT-qPCR, suggests that qSanger can be performed on
unprocessed specimen matrix without any loss in performance. In fact, it might be possible that
RNA-extraction free methods are more reliable because it eliminates the carryover risk of
high-salt, PCR-inhibiting buffers used in RNA extraction procedures.

Discussion
The COVID-19 pandemic is one of the most deadly and disruptive public health emergencies
that we have had to face in the last hundred years. To curb its rapid spread, most countries
issued shelter-in-place rules which were able to flatten the pandemic curve, but at a significant
economic cost [10]. Social distancing interventions can only be relaxed if a vaccine is
developed, which is estimated to take 12 months to develop and widely distribute, or after
widespread and rapid testing can be performed on symptomatic patients as well as anyone who
has been identified as likely to have come into contact with those who test positive [11]. This
suggests that for effective contact tracing, up to 50 additional people may need to be tested for
each positive case. However, on April 6, 2020, the US daily testing capacity was only ~100,000
to ~125,000 tests when 30,000 patients tested positive [12]. This suggests that US testing
capacity might need to be increased by a factor of 10x or more for effective contact tracing.
However, most COVID-19 tests that are currently available rely on variations on qPCR and thus

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.07.029199; this version posted April 10, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

suffer from the same supply chain issues. In particular, the limited availability of RNA extraction
kits has been an important problem for increasing COVID-19 testing capacity [13].
Here, we describe a novel quantitative Sanger (qSanger) assay that can detect COVID-19
without RNA extraction. We show that qSanger performs as well as qPCR in estimates of viral
RNA abundance and consistently detects as low as 10-20 viral genome copy equivalents, even
when VTM is added directly into the reaction mix without RNA extraction. Because qSanger is
an end-point PCR reaction with an internal spike-in control, it is more robust to inhibitors that
can exist in VTM, and failures in amplification result in undetermined results that require a
repeat reaction, as opposed to false negatives that would be obtained by qPCR. It also has
higher specificity than qPCR, as the examination of the sequencing information can be used to
distinguish similar viruses and rule out false-positives due to non-specific amplifications.
Since qSanger has an extremely high specificity enabled by the sequencing information, it can
be used for routine testing of asymptomatic individuals with high positive predictive value (PPV).
This can be a new paradigm of routine and repeated testing of individuals who are at high risk
for contracting disease, e.g., hospital staff, or those who are older or with comorbidities. Early
detection can improve individual healthcare outcomes and also enable relaxation of population
scale non-pharmaceutical interventions like social distancing measures.
In addition not requiring RNA extraction kits, our qSanger-based COVID-19 assay has a number
of additional advantages compared to existing qPCR-based tests for COVID-19. Importantly,
qSanger thermal cycling occurs in higher-throughput end-point PCR instruments, rather than
specialized qPCR instruments, and the sequencing can be run in automated Sanger
sequencers with plate feeders such as Applied Biosystems 3730xl DNA Analyzers which have
the capacity to sequence 3840 samples per day. The large existing install-base of end-point
PCR and high-throughput Sanger instruments throughout the US and the world [14] supports
rapid scale-up of qSanger-COVID-19 assays without requiring any new device or instrument
manufacturing. Given that Sanger sequencing is still the most widely used method of clinical
sequencing worldwide, the widespread adoption of qSanger-COVID-19 assay described here
can create >1M COVID-19 testing capacity per day.
More broadly, qSanger can enable an even higher volume of population-scale testing if clinical
laboratories and Sanger sequencing centers are allowed to collaborate for COVID-19 testing.
While Sanger sequencers exist in all molecular diagnostic laboratories, they are most commonly
utilized in high volume in genome centers, academic sequencing core facilities, and commercial
Sanger sequencing service laboratories. In this model, clinical laboratories could buy 96-well
master-mix reaction plates that simply require the addition of each patient sample into a reaction
well in a BioSafety Cabinet and PCR thermocycling, whereas the sequencing service laboratory
would sequence the samples for next-day results. This would enable a rapidly deployed and
distributed population-scale testing.

qSanger also has a number of other advantages that may prove to be invaluable as we learn
more information about SARS-CoV-2. Since SARS-CoV-2 mutates quickly, the availability of
sequence information can be used to identify growing clusters of mutations and aid with contact
tracing via phylogenetic analysis of the mutation data. Longer sequences can be designed to
capture a wide range of mutations in the qSanger reaction, as the virus mutates and creates
sub-strains with different clinical implications.
Moreover, as opposed to relative measurements obtained by qPCR, absolute measurements of
viral load are obtained in qSanger due to the known molecular count of the spike-in.
Quantification of viral abundance in a sample may prove to be useful for determining who is
infectious, as well as for more accurate environmental monitoring. The quantitative dynamic
range of qSanger can be broadened from 0-5000 GCE to 10-2,500,000 GCE by employing two
qSanger reactions with different molecular levels of spike-ins.
At the time of the Human Genome Project, Sanger instruments were the automated
state-of-the-art devices that generated more sequencing information in a single day than entire
laboratories could produce in a year [14]. They accelerated the release of the first human
genome by five years and ushered in an era with exponentially decreasing sequencing costs
[14-15]. With the qSanger method presented here, they can be repurposed to enable the
millions of COVID-19 diagnostics needed to suppress this global pandemic.

Sanger sequencing:
Sanger sequencing was performed by Sequetech Corporation using the BigDye Terminator
Cycle Sequencing Kit and capillary electrophoresis was performed using a Applied Biosystems
3730xl DNA Analyzer.
Data analysis:
For concordance calls, Sanger sequencing was analyzed using the following procedure. The
primary base sequence based on automatic calling were aligned to the viral genome. If the
aligned sequence matched the viral genomic sequence without any deletion, then the sample is
called positive for viral RNA. If the sequence does not match the reference, then the signal to
noise ratio is checked with any less than 500 indicating insufficient signal which returns an
indeterminate result. If signal to noise is greater than 500, then the ratio of genomic sequence to
spike-in sequence is quantified by performing robust linear regression of genomic peak heights
to spike-in peak heights.

Quantitation for figure 2 was performed with the same quality check as above but quantifying
the terminal 6 bases of reference and spike-in sequence for all primary sequences, regardless

Figure 1. ​A schematic illustration of qSanger COVID-19 assay. (​A​) Specimen processing workflow.
Reverse-transcription (RT) and PCR amplification of a SARS-CoV-2 target region is accomplished by directly addition
of Viral Transport Media (VTM) to a one-step RT-PCR master mix containing ~200 copies of synthetic spike-in DNA.
The SARS-CoV-2 target region and spike-in DNA are co-amplified on a standard thermal cycler, and the amplification
products are Sanger sequenced. Custom data analysis of the resulting chromatogram is then used to determine
whether the specimen is COVID-19 negative or positive. (​B​) Synthetic spike-in is designed with sequence homology
to the SARS-CoV-2 target so that it co-amplifies with the SARS-CoV-2 target. A 4-base pair (bp) deletion in the
spike-in design enables quantification of relative abundances of spike-in and SARS-CoV-2 DNA from a Sanger
sequencing chromatogram. The depicted forward and reverse primers are not to scale. (​C​) Representative Sanger
sequencing traces showing pure genomic sequence (top), pure spike-in sequence (middle), and sequencing from a
mixture of genomic and spike-in sequences (bottom). The spike-in used has a 4-bp offset compared to wild type (wt),
which means that when two sequences are present, the signal from each sequence can be used to estimate their
relative abundances (see arrows for examples of paired bases).

Figure 2. qSanger is a quantitative approach to measuring viral abundance in a sample. (​A​) Data analysis and
interpretation in a qSanger COVID-19 assay. Representative Sanger sequencing chromatograms are shown for
amplified products of spike-in DNA only, SarS-CoV-2 RNA only, or a mixture of the two. Since the spike-in is an
internal control for amplification and sequencing, observing the spike-in signal only indicates that SARS-CoV-2 RNA
was absent, and therefore the specimen is negative for COVID-19. In contrast, observing SARS-CoV-2 signal only
indicates that SARS-COV-2 RNA was so abundant in the specimen that it is above the quantifiable range. In a mixed
chromatogram of spike-in and SARS-CoV-2, the abundance of SARS-CoV-2 RNA is determined by the relative
contributions of SARS-CoV-2 and spike-in signal intensities. (​B​-​D​) Synthetic viral genomic RNA was added to
RT-PCR reactions at 10, 100, 1000, and 5000 GCE. The same dilutions were subjected to qSanger testing and

Across the same dilution series, the ratio (R) of genomic sequence to spike-in sequence scales with RNA added. (​D​)
When the qPCR estimate of abundance is compared to qSanger estimates of abundance, they exhibit a strong linear
relationship, indicating that qSanger performs as well as qPCR in estimates of viral RNA abundance.

Figure 3. qSanger detects SARS-COV-2 RNA when amplified directly from viral particles in transport medium. (​A​) A
total of 32 no-template controls, 32 negative control samples (Seracare) and 32 positive samples (Seracare) were
assayed. All results were concordant with Seracare and NTC. Three samples were no-calls (undetermined) due to
low signal-to-noise ratio in the sequencing results. (​B​) Positive Seracare samples were added to RT-PCR master
mix either directly from the VTM or after purification with RNA extraction kit at 125 GCE. The ratio of reference and
spike-in intensities were measured by custom data analysis. The mean qSanger ratio was 0.745 (± 0.043 s.e.m., n=8)
for direct addition, and 0.97 (± 0.041 s.e.m., n=8) for purified. The coefficient of variation (CV) of positive seracare
samples were measured for both Luna and OneTaq polymerase mixes. The CV for Luna direct VTM was 16.4%
(n=8), and for Luna purified was 12.1% (n=8). This is consistent with the theoretical counting noise associated with
quantifying ~100 molecules.

Figure 4. qSanger detects as little as 20 GCE without RNA purification. (​A​) Representative Sanger sequencing
traces of negative control virus (left) and SARS-CoV-2 sequence containing virus (right). Even when the signal is too
low to detect mixed bases, the 3’ offset caused by the deletion in the spike-in compared to the genomic sequence
identifies positive samples. The sequencing peaks identified in the inset correspond to spike-in sequence offset by 4
bp (see paired arrows). (B) Twenty samples each of negative control virus and SARS-CoV-2 sequence containing
virus were directly added to RT-PCR master mix with 100 spike-in molecules and Sanger sequencing was performed.
All samples that successfully sequenced were accurately identified (one negative sample was undetermined due to
sequencing failure).
