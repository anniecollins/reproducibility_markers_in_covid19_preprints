Since SARS- CoV was first identified in animal markets, global viromics projects have discovered thousands of coronavirus sequences in diverse animals and geographic regions. Unfortunately, there are few tools available to functionally test these novel viruses for their ability to infect humans, which has severely hampered efforts to predict the next zoonotic viral outbreak. Here we developed an approach to rapidly screen lineage B betacoronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and the recent 2019-nCoV, for receptor usage and their ability to infect cell types from different species. We show that host protease processing during viral entry is a significant barrier for several lineage B viruses and that bypassing this barrier allows several lineage B viruses to enter human cells through an unknown receptor. We also demonstrate how different lineage B viruses can recombine to gain entry into human cells and confirm that human ACE2 is the receptor for the recently emerging 2019-nCoV.",1,380,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.22.915660v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.22.915660v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2020.01.22.915660.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Our objectives were to characterize the genetic relationships of the 2019-nCoV and to search for putative recombination within the subgenus of sarbecovirus.

MethodsPutative recombination was investigated by RDP4 and Simplot v3.5.1 and discordant phylogenetic clustering in individual genomic fragments was confirmed by phylogenetic analysis using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods.

ResultsOur analysis suggests that the 2019-nCoV although closely related to BatCoV RaTG13 sequence throughout the genome (sequence similarity 96.3%), shows discordant clustering with the Bat-SARS-like coronavirus sequences. Specifically, in the 5-part spanning the first 11,498 nucleotides and the last 3-part spanning 24,341-30,696 positions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 formed a single cluster with Bat-SARS-like coronavirus sequences, whereas in the middle region spanning the 3-end of ORF1a, the ORF1b and almost half of the spike regions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 grouped in a separate distant lineage within the sarbecovirus branch.

ConclusionsThe levels of genetic similarity between the 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 suggest that the latter does not provide the exact variant that caused the outbreak in humans, but the hypothesis that 2019-nCoV has originated from bats is very likely. We show evidence that the novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) is not-mosaic consisting in almost half of its genome of a distinct lineage within the betacoronavirus.

The spike protein (S) of this virus enables binding to the human receptor ACE2, and hence presents a prime target for vaccines preventing viral entry into host cells1. The S proteins from SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 are similar2, but structural differences in the receptor binding domain (RBD) preclude the use of SARS-CoV-1-specific neutralizing antibodies to inhibit SARS-CoV-23. Here we used comparative pangenomic analysis of all sequenced Betacoronaviruses to reveal that, among all core gene clusters present in these viruses, the envelope protein E shows a variant shared by SARS and SARS-Cov2 with two completely-conserved key functional features, an ion-channel and a PDZ-binding Motif (PBM). These features trigger a cytokine storm that activates the inflammasome, leading to increased edema in lungs causing the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)4-6, the leading cause of death in SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 infection7,8. However, three drugs approved for human use may inhibit SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 Protein E, either acting upon the ion channel (Amantadine and Hexamethylene amiloride9,10) or the PBM (SB2035805), thereby potentially increasing the survival of the host, as already demonstrated for SARS-CoV-1in animal models.

No approved vaccine yet exists for any form of coronavirus. Here we use computational tools from structural biology and machine learning to identify 2019-nCoV T-cell and B-cell epitopes based on viral protein antigen presentation and antibody binding properties. These epitopes can be used to develop more effective vaccines and identify neutralizing antibodies. We identified 405 viral peptides with good antigen presentation scores for both human MHC-I and MHC-II alleles, and two potential neutralizing B-cell epitopes near the 2019-nCoV spike protein receptor binding domain (440-460 and 494-506). Analyzing mutation profiles of 68 viral genomes from four continents, we identified 96 coding-change mutations. These mutations are more likely to occur in regions with good MHC-I presentation scores (p=0.02). No mutations are present near the spike protein receptor binding domain. Based on these findings, the spike protein is likely immunogenic and a potential vaccine candidate. We validated our computational pipeline with SARS-CoV experimental data.

Significance StatementThe novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV has affected more than 100 countries and continues to spread. There is an immediate need for effective vaccines that contain antigens which trigger responses from human T-cells and B-cells (known as epitopes). Here we identify potential T-cell epitopes through an analysis of human antigen presentation, as well as B-cell epitopes through an analysis of protein structure. We identify a list of top candidates, including an epitope located on 2019-nCoV spike protein that potentially triggers both T-cell and B-cell responses. Analyzing 68 samples, we observe that viral mutations are more likely to happen in regions with strong antigen presentation, a potential form of immune evasion.

In contrast, RmYN02 showed low sequence identity (61.3%) to HCoV-19 in the receptor binding domain (RBD) and might not bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Critically, however, and in a similar manner to HCoV-19, RmYN02 was characterized by the insertion of multiple amino acids at the junction site of the S1 and S2 subunits of the Spike (S) protein.

Due to the sporadic nature of spillover events and limited availability of data, developing and validating robust, spatially explicit, predictions is challenging. Recent efforts have begun to make progress in this direction by capitalizing on machine learning methodologies. An important weakness of existing approaches, however, is that they generally rely on combining human and reservoir infection data during the training process and thus conflate risk attributable to the prevalence of the pathogen in the reservoir population with the risk attributed to the realized rate of spillover into the human population. Because effective planning of interventions requires that these components of risk be disentangled, we developed a multi-layer machine learning framework that separates these processes. Our approach begins by training models to predict the geographic range of the primary reservoir and the subset of this range in which the pathogen occurs. The spillover risk predicted by the product of these reservoir specific models is then fit to data on realized patterns of historical spillover into the human population. The result is a geographically specific spillover risk forecast that can be easily decomposed and used to guide effective intervention. Applying our method to Lassa virus, a zoonotic pathogen that regularly spills over into the human population across West Africa, results in a model that explains a modest but statistically significant portion of geographic variation in historical patterns of spillover. When combined with a mechanistic mathematical model of infection dynamics, our spillover risk model predicts that 897,700 humans are infected by Lassa virus each year across West Africa, with Nigeria accounting for more than half of these human infections.

Author SummaryThe 2019 emergence of SARS-CoV-2 is a grim reminder of the threat animal-borne pathogens pose to human health. Even prior to SARS-CoV-2, the spillover of pathogens from animal reservoirs was a persistent problem, with pathogens such as Ebola, Nipah, and Lassa regularly but unpredictably causing outbreaks. Machine-learning models that anticipate when and where pathogen transmission from animals to humans is likely to occur would help guide surveillance efforts and preemptive countermeasures like information campaigns or vaccination programs. We develop a novel machine learning framework that uses datasets describing the distribution of a virus within its host and the range of its animal host, along with data on spatial patterns of human immunity, to infer rates of animal-to-human transmission across a region. By training the model on data from the animal host alone, our framework allows rigorous validation of spillover predictions using human data. We apply our framework to Lassa fever, a viral disease of West Africa that is spread to humans by rodents, and use the predictions to update estimates of Lassa virus infections in humans. Our results suggest that Nigeria is most at risk for the emergence of Lassa virus, and should be prioritized for outbreak-surveillance.",1,8,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.05.979658v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.05.979658v3.full.pdf,_10.1101_2020.03.05.979658.txt,1,general-purpose repository,1,our full dataset  88  and the script files used to fit the models are available in a github repository [23].,our full dataset  88  and the script files used to fit the models are available in a github repository [23].;     fitting the model with these eight pixels included as  143  presences is an option in the code on the github repository but does not substantially  144  affect the overall fit of the model [23].;     the notebook file is available in the  330  github repository [23].

This approach is multi-tiered, beginning with compiling the theoretical protein sequences from genomic derived data. In the case of SARS-CoV-2 we begin with 496 peptides that would be produced by proteolytic digestion of the viral proteins. To eliminate peptides that would cause cross-reactivity and false positives we remove peptides from consideration that have sequence homology or similar chemical characteristics using a progressively larger database of background peptides. Using this pipeline, we can remove 47 peptides from consideration as diagnostic due to the presence of peptides derived from the human proteome. To address the complexity of the human microbiome, we describe a method to create a database of all proteins of relevant abundance in the saliva microbiome. By utilizing a protein-based approach to the microbiome we can more accurately identify peptides that will be problematic in COVID-19 studies which removes 12 peptides from consideration. To identify diagnostic peptides, another 7 peptides are flagged for removal following comparison to the proteome backgrounds of viral and bacterial pathogens of similar clinical presentation. By aligning the protein sequences of SARS-CoV-2 field isolates deposited to date we can identify peptides for removal due to their presence in highly variable regions that may lead to false negatives as the pathogen evolves. We provide maps of these regions and highlight 3 peptides that should be avoided as potential diagnostic or vaccine targets. Finally, we leverage publicly deposited proteomics data from human cells infected with SARS-CoV-2, as well as a second study with the closely related MERS-CoV to identify the two proteins of highest abundance in human infections. The resulting final list contains the 24 peptides most unique and diagnostic of SARS-CoV-2 infections. These peptides represent the best targets for the development of antibodies are clinical diagnostics. To demonstrate one application of this we model peptide fragmentation using a deep learning tool to rapidly generate targeted LCMS assays and data processing method for detecting CoVID-19 infected patient samples.

While the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through human respiratory droplets and contact with infected persons is clear, the aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been little studied.

MethodsThirty-five aerosol samples of three different types (total suspended particle, size segregated and deposition aerosol) were collected in Patient Areas (PAA) and Medical Staff Areas (MSA) of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University (Renmin) and Wuchang Fangcang Field Hospital (Fangcang), and Public Areas (PUA) in Wuhan, China during COVID-19 outbreak. A robust droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) method was employed to quantitate the viral SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome and determine aerosol RNA concentration.

ResultsThe ICU, CCU and general patient rooms inside Renmin, patient hall inside Fangcang had undetectable or low airborne SARS-CoV-2 concentration but deposition samples inside ICU and air sample in Fangcang patient toilet tested positive. The airborne SARS-CoV-2 in Fangcang MSA had bimodal distribution with higher concentration than those in Renmin during the outbreak but turned negative after patients number reduced and rigorous sanitization implemented. PUA had undetectable airborne SARS-CoV-2 concentration but obviously increased with accumulating crowd flow.

ConclusionsRoom ventilation, open space, proper use and disinfection of toilet can effectively limit aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Gathering of crowds with asymptomatic carriers is a potential source of airborne SARS-CoV-2. The virus aerosol deposition on protective apparel or floor surface and their subsequent resuspension is a potential transmission pathway and effective sanitization is critical in minimizing aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2.",1,341,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.08.982637v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.08.982637v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2020.03.08.982637.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Soon after the pandemic was recognized by epidemiologists, a group of biologists comprising the ARTIC Network, has devised a multiplexed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocol and primer set for targeted whole-genome amplification of SARS-CoV-2. The ARTIC primer set amplifies 98 amplicons, which are separated only in two PCRs, across a nearly entire viral genome. The original primer set and protocol showed a fairly small amplification bias when clinical samples with relatively high viral loads were used. However, when samples viral load was low, several amplicons, especially amplicons 18 and 76, exhibited low coverage or complete dropout. We have determined that these dropouts were due to a dimer formation between the forward primer for amplicon 18, 18_LEFT, and the reverse primer for amplicon 76, 76_RIGHT. Replacement of 76_RIGHT with an alternatively designed primer was sufficient to produce a drastic improvement in coverage of both amplicons. Based on this result, we replaced 12 primers in total in the ARTIC primer set that were predicted to be involved in 14 primer interactions.

COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2. Given the most optimistic projections estimating that it will take over a year to develop a vaccine, the best short-term strategy may lie in identifying virus-specific targets for small molecule interventions. All coronaviruses utilize a molecular mechanism called -1 PRF to control the relative expression of their proteins. Prior analyses of SARS-CoV revealed that it employs a structurally unique three-stemmed mRNA pseudoknot to stimulate high rates of -1 PRF, and that it also harbors a -1 PRF attenuation element. Altering -1 PRF activity negatively impacts virus replication, suggesting that this molecular mechanism may be therapeutically targeted. Here we present a comparative analysis of the original SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 frameshift signals. Structural and functional analyses revealed that both elements promote similar rates of -1 PRF and that silent coding mutations in the slippery sites and in all three stems of the pseudoknot strongly ablated -1 PRF activity.

However, the mode of virus transmission and tissue tropism is not well established yet. Recent findings of substantial liver damage in patients and ACE2+ cholangiocytes in healthy liver tissues prompted us to hypothesize that human liver ductal organoids could serve as a model to determine the susceptibility and mechanisms underlining the liver damage upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. By single-cell RNA sequencing, we found that long-term liver ductal organoid culture preserved the human specific ACE2+ population of cholangiocytes. Moreover, human liver ductal organoids were permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection and support robust replication. Notably, virus infection impaired the barrier and bile acid transporting functions of cholangiocytes through dysregulation of genes involved in tight junction formation and bile acid transportation, which could explain the bile acid accumulation and consequent liver damage in patients. These results indicate that control of liver damage caused directly by viral infection should be valued in treating COVID-19 patients.

Therefore HLA-binding prediction tools are often used to narrow down the number of peptides to test. We tested 19 epitope-HLA-binding prediction tools, and using an in vitro peptide MHC stability assay, we assessed 777 peptides that were predicted to be good binders across 11 MHC allotypes. In this investigation of potential SARS-CoV-2 epitopes we found that current prediction tools vary in performance when assessing binding stability, and they are highly dependent on the MHC allotype in question.

This is especially important if the disease-causing agent has no effective treatment, such as the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (the pathogen causing COVID-19), and shows no or similar symptoms to other common infections. We report a silicon-based integrated Point-of-Need (PoN) transducer (TriSilix) that can chemically-amplify and detect pathogen-specific sequences of nucleic acids (NA) quantitatively in real-time. Unlike other silicon-based technologies, TriSilix can be produced at wafer-scale in a standard laboratory; we have developed a series of methodologies based on metal-assisted chemical (wet) etching, electroplating, thermal bonding and laser-cutting to enable a cleanroom-free low-cost fabrication that does not require processing in an advanced semiconductor foundry. TriSilix is, therefore, resilient to disruptions in the global supply chain as the devices can be produced anywhere in the world. To create an ultra-low-cost device, the architecture proposed exploits the intrinsic properties of silicon and integrates three modes of operation in a single chip: i) electrical (Joule) heater, ii) temperature sensor (i.e. thermistor) with a negative temperature coefficient that can provide the precise temperature of the sample solution during reaction and iii) electrochemical sensor for detecting target NA. Using TriSilix, the sample solution can be maintained at a single, specific temperature (needed for isothermal amplification of NA such as Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RPA) or cycled between different temperatures (with a precision of {+/-}1.3{degrees}C) for Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) while the exact concentration of amplicons is measured quantitatively and in real-time electrochemically.

There is no therapeutic treatment specific for COVID-19. It is highly desirable to identify potential antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2 from existing drugs available for other diseases and, thus, repurpose them for treatment of COVID-19. In general, a drug repurposing effort for treatment of a new disease, such as COVID-19, usually starts from a virtual screening of existing drugs, followed by experimental validation, but the actual hit rate is generally rather low with traditional computational methods. Here we report a new virtual screening approach with accelerated free energy perturbation-based absolute binding free energy (FEP-ABFE) predictions and its use in identifying drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro). The accurate FEP-ABFE predictions were based on the use of a new restraint energy distribution (RED) function designed to accelerate the FEP-ABFE calculations and make the practical FEP-ABFE-based virtual screening of the existing drug library possible for the first time. As a result, out of twenty-five drugs predicted, fifteen were confirmed as potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. The most potent one is dipyridamole (Ki=0.04 M) which has showed promising therapeutic effects in subsequently conducted clinical studies for treatment of patients with COVID-19. Additionally, hydroxychloroquine (Ki=0.36 M) and chloroquine (Ki=0.56 M) were also found to potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 Mpro for the first time. We anticipate that the FEP-ABFE prediction-based virtual screening approach will be useful in many other drug repurposing or discovery efforts.

Significance StatementDrug repurposing effort for treatment of a new disease, such as COVID-19, usually starts from a virtual screening of existing drugs, followed by experimental validation, but the actual hit rate is generally rather low with traditional computational methods. It has been demonstrated that a new virtual screening approach with accelerated free energy perturbation-based absolute binding free energy (FEP-ABFE) predictions can reach an unprecedently high hit rate, leading to successful identification of 16 potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) from computationally selected 25 drugs under a threshold of Ki = 4 M. The outcomes of this study are valuable for not only drug repurposing to treat COVID-19, but also demonstrating the promising potential of the FEP-ABFE prediction-based virtual screening approach.",1,72,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.23.004580v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.23.004580v2.full.pdf,_10.1101_2020.03.23.004580.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Traditional sequence alignment methods are not suitable and there is a need for fast alignment-free techniques for sequence analysis. Information theory and data compression algorithms provide a rich set of mathematical and computational tools to capture essential patterns in biological sequences. In 2013, our research group (Nagaraj et al., Eur. Phys. J. Special Topics 222(3-4), 2013) has proposed a novel measure known as Effort-To-Compress (ETC) based on the notion of compression-complexity to capture the information content of sequences. In this study, we propose a compression-complexity based distance measure for automatic identification of SARS coronavirus strains from a set of viruses using only short fragments of nucleotide sequences. We also demonstrate that our proposed method can correctly distinguish SARS-CoV-2 from SARS-CoV-1 viruses by analyzing very short segments of nucleotide sequences. This work could be extended further to enable medical practitioners in automatically identifying and characterizing SARS coronavirus strain in a fast and efficient fashion using short and/or incomplete segments of nucleotide sequences. Potentially, the need for sequence assembly can be circumvented.

It is caused by a novel coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 with elusive origin. SARS-CoV-2 infects mammalian cells by binding to ACE2, a transmembrane protein. Therefore, the conservation of ACE2 and its expression pattern across mammalian species, which are yet to be comprehensively investigated, may provide valuable insights into tracing potential hosts of SARS-CoV-2.

MethodsWe analyzed gene conservation of ACE2 across mammals and collected more than 140 transcriptome datasets from human and common mammalian species, including presumed hosts of SARS-CoV-2 and other animals in close contact with humans. In order to enable comparisons across species and tissues, we used a unified pipeline to quantify and normalize ACE2 expression levels.

ResultsWe first found high conservation of ACE2 genes among common mammals at both DNA and peptide levels, suggesting that a broad range of mammalian species can potentially be the hosts of SARS-CoV-2. Next, we showed that high level of ACE2 expression in certain human tissues is consistent with clinical symptoms of COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, we observed that ACE2 expressed in a species-specific manner in the mammals examined.

While levels of genomic variability between SARS-CoV-2 isolates are limited, to our knowledge, it is not clear whether the observed patterns of variability in viral super-clades reflect ongoing adaptation of SARS-CoV-2, or merely genetic drift and founder effects. Here, we analyze more than 1100 complete, high quality SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, and provide evidence for the absence of distinct evolutionary patterns/signatures in the genomes of the currently known major clades of SARS-CoV-2. Our analyses suggest that the presence of distinct viral episomes at different geographic locations are consistent with founder effects, coupled with the rapid spread of this novel virus. We observe that while cross species adaptation of the virus is associated with hypervariability of specific protein coding regions (including the RDB domain of the spike protein), the more variable genomic regions between extant SARS-CoV-2 episomes correspond with the 3 and 5 UTRs, suggesting that at present viral protein coding genes should not be subjected to different adaptive evolutionary pressures in different viral strains.

We fortuitously found that C3A was more susceptible to human coronavirus HCoV-OC43 infection than HepG2, which was attributed to the increased efficiency of virus entry into C3A cells. In an effort to search for the host cellular protein(s) mediating the differential susceptibility of the two cell lines to HCoV-OC43 infection, we found that ADAP2, GILT and LY6E, three cellular proteins with known activity of interfering virus entry, expressed at significantly higher levels in HepG2 cells. Functional analyses revealed that ectopic expression of LY6E, but not GILT or ADAP2, in HEK 293 cells inhibited the entry of HCoV-OC43. While overexpression of LY6E in C3A and A549 cells efficiently inhibited the infection of HCoV-OC43, knockdown of LY6E expression in HepG2 significantly increased its susceptibility to HCoV-OC43 infection. Moreover, we found that LY6E also efficiently restricted the entry mediated by the envelope spike proteins of other human coronaviruses, including the currently pandemic SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, overexpression of serine protease TMPRSS2 or amphotericin treatment significantly neutralized the IFITM3 restriction of human coronavirus entry, but did not compromise the effect of LY6E on the entry of human coronaviruses. The work reported herein thus demonstrates that LY6E is a critical antiviral immune effector that controls CoV infection and pathogenesis via a distinct mechanism.

ImportanceVirus entry into host cells is one of the key determinants of host range and cell tropism and is subjected to the control by host innate and adaptive immune responses. In the last decade, several interferon inducible cellular proteins, including IFITMs, GILT, ADAP2, 25CH and LY6E, had been identified to modulate the infectious entry of a variety of viruses. Particularly, LY6E was recently identified as host factors to facilitate the entry of several human pathogenic viruses, including human immunodeficiency virus, influenza A virus and yellow fever virus.

SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein is an attractive candidate for vaccine, antibodies and inhibitor development because of many roles it plays in attachment, fusion and entry into the host cell. In this study, we characterized the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein by immune-informatics techniques to put forward potential B and T cell epitopes, followed by the use of epitopes in construction of a multi-epitope peptide vaccine construct (MEPVC). The MEPVC revealed robust host immune system simulation with high production of immunoglobulins, cytokines and interleukins. Stable conformation of the MEPVC with a representative innate immune TLR3 receptor was observed involving strong hydrophobic and hydrophilic chemical interactions, along with enhanced contribution from salt-bridges towards inter-molecular stability. Molecular dynamics simulation in solution aided further in interpreting strong affinity of the MEPVC for TLR3. This stability is the attribute of several vital residues from both TLR3 and MEPVC as shown by radial distribution function (RDF) and a novel analytical tool axial frequency distribution (AFD). Comprehensive binding free energies estimation was provided at the end that concluded major domination by electrostatic and minor from van der Waals.

SARS-Cov-2 entry into a cell is dependent upon binding of the viral spike (S) protein to cellular receptor and on cleavage of the spike protein by the host cell proteases such as Cathepsin L and Cathepsin B. CTSL/B are crucial elements of lysosomal pathway and both enzymes are almost exclusively located in the lysosomes.CTSL disruption offers potential for CoVID-19 therapies. The mechanisms of disruption include: decreasing expression of CTSL, direct inhibition of CTSL activity and affecting the conditions of CTSL environment (increase pH in lysosomes).

We have conducted a high throughput drug screen gene expression analysis to identify compounds that would downregulate the expression of CTSL/CTSB. One of the top significant results shown to downregulate the expression of the CTSL gene is Amantadine. Amantadine was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 1968 as a prophylactic agent for influenza and later for Parkinsons disease. It is available as a generic drug..

Amantadine in addition to downregulating CTSL appears to further disrupt lysosomal pathway, hence interfering with the capacity of the virus to replicate. It acts as a lysosomotropic agent altering the CTSL functional environment. We hypothesize that Amantadine could decrease the viral load in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and as such it may serve as a potent therapeutic decreasing the replication and infectivity of the virus likely leading to better clinical outcomes. Clinical studies will be needed to examine the therapeutic utility of amantadine in COVID-19 infection.",1,420,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.05.026187v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.05.026187v2.full.pdf,_10.1101_2020.04.05.026187.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Our comprehensive analysis of several large genomic datasets that included over 290,000 samples representing >400 population groups identified multiple ACE2 protein-altering variants, some of which mapped to the S-protein-interacting ACE2 surface.

In the present contribution we study, by all-atom equilibrium and enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations, the interaction between the SARS Unique Domain and RNA guanine quadruplexes, a process involved in eluding the defensive response of the host thus favoring viral infection of human cells. Our results evidence two stable binding modes involving an interaction site spanning either the protein dimer interface or only one monomer. The free energy profile unequivocally points to the dimer mode as the thermodynamically favored one. The effect of these binding modes in stabilizing the protein dimer was also assessed, being related to its biological role in assisting SARS viruses to bypass the host protective response. This work also constitutes a first step of the possible rational design of efficient therapeutic agents aiming at perturbing the interaction between SARS Unique Domain and guanine quadruplexes, hence enhancing the host defenses against the virus.

Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that age is one of the strongest risk factors influencing the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19. Here, we interrogate the transcriptional features and cellular landscapes of the aging human lung through integrative analysis of bulk and single-cell transcriptomics. By intersecting these age-associated changes with experimental data on host interactions between SARS-CoV-2 or its relative SARS-CoV, we identify several age-associated factors that may contribute to the heightened severity of COVID-19 in older populations. We observed that age-associated gene expression and cell populations are significantly linked to the heightened severity of COVID-19 in older populations. The aging lung is characterized by increased vascular smooth muscle contraction, reduced mitochondrial activity, and decreased lipid metabolism. Lung epithelial cells, macrophages, and Th1 cells decrease in abundance with age, whereas fibroblasts, pericytes and CD4+ Tcm cells increase in abundance with age. Several age-associated genes have functional effects on SARS-CoV replication, and directly interact with the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. Interestingly, age-associated genes are heavily enriched among those induced or suppressed by SARS-CoV-2 infection. These analyses illuminate potential avenues for further studies on the relationship between the aging lung and COVID-19 pathogenesis, which may inform strategies to more effectively treat this disease.",1,120,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.07.030684v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.07.030684v2.full.pdf,_10.1101_2020.04.07.030684.txt,1,"general-purpose repository, supplement",0,codes used for data analysis or generation of the figures related to this study are available upon request to the corresponding author and will be deposited to github upon publication for free public access. assessing functional roles of lung age-associated genes in sars-cov to assess whether any age-associated genes affect host responses to sars-cov (a coronavirus related to sars-cov-2) we analyzed the data from a published sirna screen of host factors influencing sars-cov 63 (data set s1 in the publication; accessed on march 20 2020).   biorxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.07.030684; this version posted april 15 2020.,NA

We have developed an integrative approach to predict repurposed drug candidates that can reverse SARS-CoV-2-induced gene expression in host cells, and evaluate their efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. We found that 13 virus-induced gene expression signatures computed from various viral preclinical models could be reversed by compounds previously identified to be effective against SARS- or MERS-CoV, as well as drug candidates recently reported to be efficacious against SARS-CoV-2. Based on the ability of candidate drugs to reverse these 13 infection signatures, as well as other clinical criteria, we identified 10 novel candidates. The four drugs bortezomib, dactolisib, alvocidib, and methotrexate inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced cytopathic effect in Vero E6 cells at < 1 {micro}M, but only methotrexate did not exhibit unfavorable cytotoxicity. Although further improvement of cytotoxicity prediction and bench testing is required, our computational approach has the potential to rapidly and rationally identify repurposed drug candidates against SARS-CoV-2.

SARS-CoV, the agent responsible for the 2003 SARS outbreak, utilizes ACE2 and TMPRSS2 host molecules for viral entry. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 have recently been implicated in SARS-CoV-2 viral infection. Additional host molecules including ADAM17, cathepsin L, CD147, and GRP78 may also function as receptors for SARS-CoV-2.

To determine the expression and in situ localization of candidate SARS-CoV-2 receptors in the respiratory mucosa, we analyzed gene expression datasets from airway epithelial cells of 515 healthy subjects, gene promoter activity analysis using the FANTOM5 dataset containing 120 distinct sample types, single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) of 10 healthy subjects, immunoblots on multiple airway epithelial cell types, and immunohistochemistry on 98 human lung samples.

We demonstrate absent to low ACE2 promoter activity in a variety of lung epithelial cell samples and low ACE2 gene expression in both microarray and scRNAseq datasets of epithelial cell populations. Consistent with gene expression, rare ACE2 protein expression was observed in the airway epithelium and alveoli of human lung. We present confirmatory evidence for the presence of TMPRSS2, CD147, and GRP78 protein in vitro in airway epithelial cells and confirm broad in situ protein expression of CD147 in the respiratory mucosa.

Spike glycoprotein is widely considered as a possible target to be explored because of its role during the entry of coronaviruses into host cells. We analyzed 320 whole-genome sequences and 320 spike protein sequences of SARS-CoV-2 using multiple sequence alignment tools.

However, animal models, particularly non-human primate models, are urgently needed for critical questions that could not be answered in clinical patients, evaluations of anti-viral drugs and vaccines. In this study, two families of non-human primates, Old world monkeys (12 Macaca mulatta, 6 Macaca fascicularis) and New world monkeys (6 Callithrix jacchus), were experimentally inoculated with SARS-CoV-2. Clinical signs were recorded. Samples were collected for analysis of viral shedding, viremia and histopathological examination. Increased body temperature was observed in 100% (12/12) M. mulatta, 33.3% (2/6) M. fascicularis and none (0/6) of C. jacchus post inoculation of SARS-CoV-2. All of M. mulatta and M. fascicularis showed chest radiographic abnormality. Viral genomes were detected in nasal swabs, throat swabs, anal swabs and blood from all 3 species of monkeys. Viral shedding from upper respiratory samples reached the peak between day 6 and day 8 post inoculation. From necropsied M. mulatta and M. fascicularis, the tissues showing virus positive were mainly lung, weasand, bronchus and spleen. No viral genome was seen in any of tissues from 2 necropsied C. jacchus. Severe gross lesions and histopathological changes were observed in lung, heart and stomach of SARS-CoV-2 infected animals. In summary, we have established a NHP model for COVID-19, which could be used to evaluate drugs and vaccines, and investigate viral pathogenesis.

Sequence analysis suggests that the three adjacent nucleotide changes that result in the K203/R204 variant have arisen by homologous recombination from the core sequence (CS) of the leader transcription-regulating sequence (TRS) as opposed to a step-wise mutation model. The resulting sequence changes generate a novel sub-genomic RNA transcript for the C-terminal dimerization domain. Deep sequencing data from 981 clinical samples confirmed the presence of the novel TRS-CS-dimerization domain RNA in individuals with the K203/R204 variant. Quantification of sub-genomic RNA indicates that viruses with the K203/R204 variant may also have increased expression of sub-genomic RNA from other open reading frames.

The finding that homologous recombination from the TRS may have occurred since the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 in humans resulting in both coding changes and novel sub-genomic RNA transcripts suggests this as a mechanism for diversification and adaptation within its new host.

ImportanceA major variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus (R203K/G204R in the nucleocapsid) results in changes to the nucleocapsid at both the protein and RNA level. We show this variant likely arose by homologous recombination from the core sequence of the leader transcription-regulating sequence (TRS) elsewhere in the viral genome. This recombination event introduced a new TRS between the RNA binding and dimerization domains of nucleocapsid that generates a novel sub-genomic RNA transcript. Presence of the K203/R204 variant was significantly associated with increased expression of nucleocapsid and sub-genomic RNA from other open reading frames. The mechanism by which the virus generates diversity, specifically how this KR variant arose and how it generated a novel major sub-genomic transcript is relevant to how future major shifts may arise and their potential functional implications.",1,5,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.10.029454v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.10.029454v2.full.pdf,_10.1101_2020.04.10.029454.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

This stems from the heterogenous response of individuals to disease which is also reflected in the inter-individual variability of gene expression responses. This in turn obscures differential gene expression analysis (DGE). In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, we wondered whether an alternative to DGE approaches could be applied to dissect the molecular nature of a host-response to infection exemplified here by an analysis of H1N1 influenza, community/hospital acquired pneumonia (CAP) and sepsis. To this end, we turned to the analysis of ensemble gene noise. Ensemble gene noise, as we defined it here, represents a variance within an individual for a collection of genes encoding for either members of known biological pathways or subunits of annotated protein complexes. From the law of total variance, ensemble gene noise depends on the stoichiometry of the ensemble genes expression and on their average noise (variance). Thus, rather than focusing on specific genes, ensemble gene noise allows for the holistic identification and interpretation of gene expression disbalance on the level of gene networks and systems. Comparing H1N1, CAP and sepsis patients we spotted common disturbances in a number of pathways/protein complexes relevant to the sepsis pathology which lead to an increase in the ensemble gene noise. Among others, these include mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I and peroxisomes which could be readily targeted for adjuvant treatment by methylene blue and 4-phenylbutyrate respectively. Finally, we showed that ensemble gene noise could be successfully applied for the prediction of clinical outcome, namely mortality, of CAP and sepsis patients. Thus, we conclude that ensemble gene noise represents a promising approach for the investigation of molecular mechanisms of a pathology through a prism of alterations in coherent expression of gene circuits.",1,474,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.10.035717v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.10.035717v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2020.04.10.035717.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

The novel change was observed in samples collected in the month of March, whereas was found to be absent in samples collected in January with the respective persons travel history to China. Phylogenetic analysis clustered the sequences with this change as one separate clade. Mutation was predicted as stabilising change by insilco tool DynaMut.

Here we developed a pilot-scale production of a purified inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus vaccine candidate (PiCoVacc), which induced SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies in mice, rats and non-human primates. These antibodies potently neutralized 10 representative SARS-CoV-2 strains, indicative of a possible broader neutralizing ability against SARS-CoV-2 strains circulating worldwide. Immunization with two different doses (3g or 6 g per dose) provided partial or complete protection in macaques against SARS-CoV-2 challenge, respectively, without any antibody-dependent enhancement of infection. Systematic evaluation of PiCoVacc via monitoring clinical signs, hematological and biochemical index, and histophathological analysis in macaques suggests that it is safe. These data support the rapid clinical development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines for humans.

Age, smoking, obesity, and chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes have been described as risk factors for severe complications and mortality in COVID-19. Obesity and diabetes are usually associated with dysregulated lipid synthesis and clearance which can initiate or aggravate pulmonary inflammation and injury. It has been shown that for viral entry into the host cell, SARS-CoV-2 utilizes the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors present on the cells. We aimed to characterize how SARS-CoV-2 dysregulates lipid metabolism pathways in the host and the effect of dysregulated lipogenesis on the regulation of ACE2, specifically in obesity. In our study, through the re-analysis of publicly available transcriptomic data, we first found that lung epithelial cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 showed upregulation of genes associated with lipid metabolism, including the SOC3 gene which is involved in regulation of inflammation and inhibition of leptin signaling. This is of interest as viruses may hijack host lipid metabolism to allow completion of their viral replication cycles. Furthermore, a mouse model of diet-induced obesity showed a significant increase in Ace2 expression in the lungs which negatively correlated with the expression of genes that code for sterol response element binding proteins 1 and 2 (SREBP). Suppression of Srebp1 showed a significant increase in Ace2 expression in the lung.

We recently demonstrated robust upregulation of several PARPs following infection with Murine Hepatitis Virus (MHV), a model coronavirus. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 infection strikingly upregulates MARylating PARPs and induces the expression of genes encoding enzymes for salvage NAD synthesis from nicotinamide (NAM) and nicotinamide riboside (NR), while downregulating other NAD biosynthetic pathways. We show that overexpression of PARP10 is sufficient to depress cellular NAD and that the activities of the transcriptionally induced enzymes PARP7, PARP10, PARP12 and PARP14 are limited by cellular NAD and can be enhanced by pharmacological activation of NAD synthesis. We further demonstrate that infection with MHV induces a severe attack on host cell NAD+ and NADP+. Finally, we show that NAMPT activation, NAM and NR dramatically decrease the replication of an MHV virus that is sensitive to PARP activity.

Here, we assess the cell type-specific RNA expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and CTSL through an integrated analysis of 107 single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-Seq studies, including 22 lung and airways datasets (16 unpublished), and 85 datasets from other diverse organs. Joint expression of ACE2 and the accessory proteases identifies specific subsets of respiratory epithelial cells as putative targets of viral infection in the nasal passages, airways, and alveoli. Cells that co-express ACE2 and proteases are also identified in cells from other organs, some of which have been associated with COVID-19 transmission or pathology, including gut enterocytes, corneal epithelial cells, cardiomyocytes, heart pericytes, olfactory sustentacular cells, and renal epithelial cells. Performing the first meta-analyses of scRNA-seq studies, we analyzed 1,176,683 cells from 282 nasal, airway, and lung parenchyma samples from 164 donors spanning fetal, childhood, adult, and elderly age groups, associate increased levels of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and CTSL in specific cell types with increasing age, male gender, and smoking, all of which are epidemiologically linked to COVID-19 susceptibility and outcomes. Notably, there was a particularly low expression of ACE2 in the few young pediatric samples in the analysis. Further analysis reveals a gene expression program shared by ACE2+TMPRSS2+ cells in nasal, lung and gut tissues, including genes that may mediate viral entry, subtend key immune functions, and mediate epithelial-macrophage cross-talk. Amongst these are IL6, its receptor and co-receptor, IL1R, TNF response pathways, and complement genes. Cell type specificity in the lung and airways and smoking effects were conserved in mice.

SARS-CoV-2 relies on its spike protein, in particular the receptor binding domain (RBD), to bind human cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for viral entry, and thus targeting RBD holds the promise for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this work, a competitive biopanning strategy of a phage display antibody library was applied to screen blocking antibodies against RBD. High-affinity antibodies were enriched after the first round using a standard panning process in which RBD-His recombinant protein was immobilized as a bait. At the next two rounds, immobilized ACE2-Fc and free RBD-His proteins were mixed with the enriched phage antibodies. Antibodies binding to RBD at epitopes different from ACE2-binding site were captured by the immobilized ACE2-Fc, forming a ""sandwich"" complex. Only antibodies competed with ACE2 for recognizing RBD at the same or similar epitopes can bind to the free RBD-His in the supernatant and be subsequently separated by the Ni-NTA magnetic beads. Top 1 lead from the competitive biopanning of a synthetic antibody library, Lib AB1, was produced as the full-length IgG1 format.

Here we analyzed the genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and other single-strand RNA (ssRNA) viruses for the presence of a unique cis RNA element called SECReTE. This motif consists of 10 or more consecutive triplet nucleotide repeats where a pyrimidine nucleotide (C or U) in present every third base, and which we identified in mRNAs encoding secreted proteins in bacteria, yeast, and humans. This motif facilitates mRNA localization to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), along with the enhanced translation and secretion of translated protein. We now examined for SECReTE presence in Group IV and V RNA viruses, the former including the Coronaviridae, like SARS-CoV-2 and other positive (+)ssRNA viruses, and the latter consisting of negative (-) ssRNA viruses. Interestingly, the SARS-CoV-2 genome contains 40 SECReTE motifs at an abundance of ~1.3 SECReTEs/kilobase (kb). Moreover, all ssRNA viruses we examined contain multiple copies of this motif and appears in (+)ssRNA viruses as non-random in occurrence and independent of genome length. Importantly, (+)ssRNA viruses (e.g. Coronaviruses and Hepaciviruses), which utilize ER membranes to create double membrane vesicles to serve as viral replication centers (VRCs), contain more SECReTE motifs per kb as compared to (-)ssRNA viruses (e.g. Rabies, Mumps, and Influenza), that replicate in the nucleus or the cytoplasm, or other (+)ssRNA viruses (e.g. Enteroviruses and Flaviviruses) which employ different organellar membranes. As predicted by our earlier work, SECReTE sequences are mostly found in membranal or ER-associated/secreted proteins. Thus, we propose that SECReTE motifs could be important for the efficient translation and secretion of secreted viral proteins, as well as for VRC formation.

Not only do such molecules often fulfil critical biological functions, but also, they may alter the binding of newly designed drugs. In crystal structures, sites consistently occupied in each unit cell yield electron density clouds that represent water molecule presence. These are recorded in virtually all high-resolution structures obtained through X-ray diffraction. In this work, we utilized the wealth of data from the RCSB Protein Data Bank to train a residual deep learning model named  hotWater to identify sites on the surface of proteins that are most likely to bind water, the so-called water hot spots. The model can be used to score existing water molecules from a PDB file to provide their ranking according to the predicted binding strength or to scan the surface of a protein to determine the most likely water hot-spots de novo. This is computationally much more efficient than currently used molecular dynamics simulations. Based on testing the model on three example proteins, which have been resolved using both high-resolution X-ray crystallography (providing accurate positions of trapped waters) as well as low-resolution X-ray diffraction, NMR or CryoEM (where structure refinement does not yield water positions), we were able to show that the hotWater method is able to recover in the ""water-free"" structures many water binding sites known from the high-resolution structures. A blind test on a newly solved protein structure with waters removed from the PDB also showed good prediction of the crystal water positions. This was compared to two known algorithms that use electron density and was shown to have higher recall at resolutions >2.6 [A].

Therefore, assays to measure how antibodies and sera affect Spike-mediated viral infection are important for studying immunity. Because SARS-CoV-2 is a biosafety-level-3 virus, one way to simplify such assays is to pseudotype biosafety-level-2 viral particles with Spike. Such pseudotyping has now been described for single-cycle lentiviral, retroviral and VSV particles, but the reagents and protocols are not widely available. Here we detail how to effectively pseudotype lentiviral particles with SARS-CoV-2 Spike and infect 293T cells engineered to express the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, ACE2. We also make all the key experimental reagents available in the BEI Resources repository of ATCC and the NIH.

Therefore, we implemented immunoinformatics approach to design an efficient multi-epitopes vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.

ResultsThe designed vaccine construct has several immunodominant epitopes from structural proteins of Spike, Nucleocapsid, Membrane and Envelope. These peptides promote cellular and humoral immunity and Interferon gamma responses. In addition, these epitopes have antigenicity ability and no allergenicity probability. To enhance the vaccine immunogenicity, we used three potent adjuvants; Flagellin, a driven peptide from high mobility group box 1 as HP-91 and human beta defensin 3 protein. The physicochemical and immunological properties of the vaccine structure were evaluated. Tertiary structure of the vaccine protein was predicted and refined by I-Tasser and galaxi refine and validated using Rampage and ERRAT. Results of Ellipro showed 242 residues from vaccine might be conformational B cell epitopes. Docking of vaccine with Toll-Like Receptors 3, 5 and 8 proved an appropriate interaction between the vaccine and receptor proteins. In silico cloning demonstrated that the vaccine can be efficiently expressed in Escherichia coli.

ConclusionsThe designed multi epitope vaccine is potentially antigenic in nature and has the ability to induce humoral and cellular immune responses against SARS-CoV-2. This vaccine can interact appropriately with the TLR3, 5, and 8. Also, this vaccine has high quality structure and suitable characteristics such as high stability and potential for expression in Escherichia coli.",1,313,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.20.051557v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.20.051557v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2020.04.20.051557.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

In this study, we firstly analyzed 20 convalescent serum samples collected from SARS-CoV infected individuals during the 2003 SARS outbreak. All patient sera reacted strongly with the S1 subunit and receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV, cross-reacted with the S ectodomain, S1, RBD, and S2 proteins of SARS-CoV-2, and neutralized both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 S protein-driven infections. Multiple panels of antisera from mice and rabbits immunized with a full-length S and RBD immunogens of SARS-CoV were also characterized, verifying the cross-reactive neutralization against SARS-CoV-2.

Full-genome-sequence computational analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 genome will allow us to understand the recent evolutionary events and adaptability mechanisms more accurately, as there is still neither effective therapeutic nor prophylactic strategy. In this study, we used population genetics analysis to infer the mutation rate and plausible recombination events that may have contributed to the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Furthermore, we localized targets of recent and strong positive selection. The genomic regions that appear to be under positive selection are largely co-localized with regions in which recombination from non-human hosts appeared to have taken place in the past. Our results suggest that the pangolin coronavirus genome may have contributed to the SARS-CoV-2 genome by recombination with the bat coronavirus genome. However, we find evidence for additional recombination events that involve coronavirus genomes from other hosts, i.e., Hedgehog and Sparrow. Even though recombination events within human hosts cannot be directly assessed, due to the high similarity of SARS-CoV-2 genomes, we infer that recombinations may have recently occurred within human hosts using a linkage disequilibrium analysis. In addition, we employed an Approximate Bayesian Computation approach to estimate the parameters of a demographic scenario involving an exponential growth of the size of the SARS-CoV-2 populations that have infected European, Asian and Northern American cohorts, and we demonstrated that a rapid exponential growth in population size can support the observed polymorphism patterns in SARS-CoV-2 genomes.",1,409,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.21.054122v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.21.054122v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2020.04.21.054122.txt,1,supplement,0,a table of the contributors is available in dataset s1.,NA

MethodsVarious evolution analysis methods were employed.

ResultsThe estimated Ka/Ks ratio of SARS-CoV-2 is 1.008 or 1.094 based on 622 or 3624 SARS-CoV-2 genomes, and the time to the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) was inferred in late September 2019. Further 9 key specific sites of highly linkage and four major haplotypes H1, H2, H3 and H4 were found. The Ka/Ks, detected population size and development trends of each major haplotype showed H3 and H4 subgroups were going through a purify evolution and almost disappeared after detection, indicating H3 and H4 might have existed for a long time, while H1 and H2 subgroups were going through a near neutral or neutral evolution and globally increased with time. Notably the frequency of H1 was generally high in Europe and correlated to death rate (r>0.37).

While the global source sink dynamics of the different seasonal influenza viruses have been studied intensively, its local spread remains less clear. In order to improve our understanding of how influenza is transmitted on a city scale, we collected an extremely densely sampled set of influenza sequences alongside patient metadata. To do so, we sequenced influenza viruses isolated from patients of two different hospitals, as well as private practitioners in Basel, Switzerland during the 2016/2017 influenza season. The genetic sequences reveal that repeated introductions into the city drove the influenza season. We then reconstruct how the effective reproduction number changed over the course of the season. We find trends in transmission dynamics correlated positively with trends in temperature, but not relative humidity nor school holidays. Alongside the genetic sequence data that allows us to see how individual cases are connected, we gathered patient information, such as the age or household status. Zooming into the local transmission outbreaks suggests that the elderly were to a large extent infected within their own transmission network, while school children likely drove the spread within the remaining transmission network. These patterns will be valuable to plan interventions combating the spread of respiratory diseases within cities given that similar patterns are observed for other influenza seasons and cities.

Author summaryAs shown with the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, respiratory diseases can quickly spread around the globe. While it can be hugely important to understand how diseases spread around the globe, local spread is most often the main driver of novel infections of respiratory diseases such as SARS-CoV-2 or influenza. We here use genetic sequence data alongside patient information to better understand what the drives the local spread of influenza by looking at the 2016/2017 influenza season in Basel, Switzerland as an example. The genetic sequence data allows us to reconstruct the how the transmission dynamics changed over the course of the season, which we correlate to changes, but not humidity or school holidays. Additionally, the genetic sequence data allows us to see how individual cases are connected. Using patient information, such as age and household status our analyses suggest that the elderly mainly transmit within their own transmission network.

Since then it has rapidly infected people around the world, with more than 4.5 million confirmed cases by the middle of May 2020. Early genome sequencing of the virus has enabled the development of molecular diagnostics and the commencement of therapy and vaccine development. The analysis of the early sequences showed relatively few evolutionary selection pressures. However, with the rapid worldwide expansion into diverse human populations, significant genetic variations are becoming increasingly likely. The current limitations on social movement between countries also offers the opportunity for these viral variants to become distinct strains with potential implications for diagnostics, therapies and vaccines.

MethodsWe used the current sequencing archives (NCBI and GISAID) to investigate 15,487 whole genomes, looking for evidence of strain diversification and selective pressure.

ResultsWe used 6,294 SNPs to build a phylogenetic tree of SARS-CoV-2 diversity and noted strong evidence for the existence of two major clades and six sub-clades, unevenly distributed across the world. We also noted that convergent evolution has potentially occurred across several locations in the genome, showing selection pressures, including on the spike glycoprotein where we noted a potentially critical mutation that could affect its binding to the ACE2 receptor. We also report on mutations that could prevent current molecular diagnostics from detecting some of the sub-clades.

These genomes were from the viruses causing infections in the earliest recognized phase of the pandemic affecting Houston. Substantial viral genomic diversity was identified, which we interpret to mean that the virus was introduced into Houston many times independently by individuals who had traveled from different parts of the country and the world. The majority of viruses are apparent progeny of strains derived from Europe and Asia. We found no significant evidence of more virulent viral types, stressing the linkage between severe disease, underlying medical conditions, and perhaps host genetics.

SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19 pandemic is an RNA virus prone to mutations. Formation of a stable binding interface between the Spike (S) protein Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 and Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) of host actuates viral entry. Yet, how this binding interface evolves as virus acquires mutations during pandemic remains elusive. Here, using a high fidelity bioinformatics pipeline, we analysed 31,403 SARS-CoV-2 genomes across the globe, and identified 444 non-synonymous mutations that cause 49 distinct amino acid substitutions in the RBD. Molecular phylogenetic analysis suggested independent emergence of these RBD mutants during pandemic. In silico structure modelling of interfaces induced by mutations on residues which directly engage ACE2 or lie in the near vicinity revealed molecular rearrangements and binding energies unique to each RBD mutant. Comparative structure analysis using binding interface from mouse that prevents SARS-CoV-2 entry uncovered minimal molecular determinants in RBD necessary for the formation of stable interface. We identified that interfacial interaction involving amino acid residues N487 and G496 on either ends of the binding scaffold are indispensable to anchor RBD and are well conserved in all SARS-like corona viruses. All other interactions appear to be required to locally remodel binding interface with varying affinities and thus may decide extent of viral transmission and disease outcome. Together, our findings propose the modalities and variations in RBD-ACE2 interface formation exploited by SARS-CoV-2 for endurance.

ImportanceCOVID-19, so far the worst hit pandemic to mankind, started in January 2020 and is still prevailing globally. Our study identified key molecular arrangements in RBD-ACE2 interface that help virus to tolerate mutations and prevail. In addition, RBD mutations identified in this study can serve as a molecular directory for experimental biologists to perform functional validation experiments.

Using comparative genomics analysis, we traced the profiles of the whole-genome mutations and compared the frequency of each mutation in the studied population. The accumulation of mutations during the epidemic period with their geographic locations was also monitored. The results showed 782 variant sites, of which 512 (65.47%) had a non-synonymous effect. Frequencies of mutated alleles revealed the presence of 38 recurrent non-synonymous mutations, including ten hotspot mutations with a prevalence higher than 0.10 in this population and distributed in six SARS-CoV-2 genes. The distribution of these recurrent mutations on the world map revealed certain genotypes specific to the geographic location.

The ability of this agent to be transmitted by blood transfusion has not been documented, although viral RNA has been detected in serum. Exposure to treatment with riboflavin and ultraviolet light (R + UV) reduces blood-borne pathogens while maintaining blood product quality. Here, we report on the efficacy of R + UV in reducing SARS-CoV-2 infectivity when tested in human plasma and whole blood products.

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODSSARS-CoV-2 (isolate USA-WA1/2020) was used to inoculate plasma and whole blood units that then underwent treatment with riboflavin and UV light (Mirasol Pathogen Reduction Technology System, Terumo BCT, Lakewood, CO). The infectious titers of SARS-CoV-2 in the samples before and after R + UV treatment were determined by plaque assay on Vero cells. Each plasma pool (n=9) underwent R + UV treatment performed in triplicate using individual units of plasma and then repeated using individual whole blood donations (n=3).

RESULTSRiboflavin and UV light reduced the infectious titer of SARS-CoV-2 below the limit of detection for plasma products at 60-100% of the recommended energy dose. At the UV light dose recommended by the manufacturer, the mean log reductions in the viral titers were [&ge;] 4.79 {+/-} 0.15 Logs in plasma and 3.30 {+/-} 0.26 in whole blood units.

CONCLUSIONRiboflavin and UV light effectively reduced the titer of SARS-CoV-2 to the limit of detection in human plasma and by 3.30 {+/-} 0.26 on average in whole blood. Two clades of SARS-CoV-2 have been described and questions remain about whether exposure to one strain confers strong immunity to the other.

As a result, there is a critical need for rapid and continuously updated access to the latest molecular data in a format in which all data can be quickly cross-referenced and compared. We adapted our genome browser visualization tool to the viral genome for this purpose. Molecular data, curated from published studies or from database submissions, are mapped to the viral genome and grouped together into ""annotation tracks"" where they can be visualized along the linear map of the viral genome sequence and programmatically downloaded in standard format for analysis.

ResultsThe UCSC Genome Browser for SARS-CoV-2 (https://genome.ucsc.edu/covid19.html) provides continuously updated access to the mutations in the many thousands of SARS-CoV-2 genomes deposited in GISAID and the international nucleotide sequencing databases, displayed alongside phylogenetic trees. These data are augmented with alignments of bat, pangolin, and other animal and human coronavirus genomes, including per-base evolutionary rate analysis. All available annotations are cross-referenced on the virus genome, including those from major databases (PDB, RFAM, IEDB, UniProt) as well as up-to-date individual results from preprints. Annotated data include predicted and validated immune epitopes, promising antibodies, RT-PCR and sequencing primers, CRISPR guides (from research, diagnostics, vaccines, and therapies), and points of interaction between human and viral genes. As a community resource, any user can add manual annotations which are quality checked and shared publicly on the browser the next day.

ConclusionsWe invite all investigators to contribute additional data and annotations to this resource to accelerate research and development activities globally. Contact us at genome-www@soe.ucsc.edu with data suggestions or requests for support for adding data.

These observations open up an obvious question about the rate and direction of mutational pressure for further vaccine and therapeutics designing. In this study, we did a comparative analysis of ORF1a and ORF1b by using the first isolate (Wuhan strain) as the parent sequence. We observed that most of the nucleotide mutations are C to U transitions. The rate of synonymous C to U transitions is significantly higher than the rate of nonsynonymous ones, indicating negative selection on amino acid substitutions. Further, trends in nucleotide usage bias have been investigated in 49 coronaviruses species. A strong bias in nucleotide usage in fourfold degenerated sites towards uracil residues is seen in ORF1 of all the studied coronaviruses. A more substantial mutational U pressure is observed in ORF1a than in ORF1b owing to the translation of ORF1ab via programmed ribosomal frameshifting. Unlike other nucleotide mutations, mutational U pressure caused by cytosine deamination, mostly occurring in the RNA-plus strand, cannot be corrected by the proof-reading machinery of coronaviruses. The knowledge generated on the direction of mutational pressure during translation of viral RNA-plus strands has implications for vaccine and nucleoside analogue development for treating covid-19 and other coronavirus infections.",1,541,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.05.078238v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.05.078238v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2020.05.05.078238.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

These viruses belong to two lineages: one from Guangdong (GD/P) and the other from Guangxi (GX/P). The GD/P viruses are particularly intriguing as the amino-acid sequence of the receptor binding domain of the spike protein is very similar to that of the human SARS-CoV-2 virus (97.4%)2. This characteristic suggests that GD/P viruses are capable of binding human ACE2 receptor and may therefore be able to mediate infection of human cells. Whereas all six GX/P genomes were deposited as annotated sequences in GenBank, none of the two GD/P genomes assembled in previous studies2,3 are currently available. To overcome this absence, I assembled these genomes from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) data available for SARS-CoV-2-like viruses detected in five captive pangolins from Guangdong. I found the genome assemblies of GD/P virus of poor quality, having high levels of missing data. Additionally, unexpected reads in the Illumina sequencing data were identified. The GD/P2S dataset2 contains reads that are identical to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting either the coexistence of two SARS-CoV-2-like viruses in the same pangolin or contamination by the human virus. In the four other GD/P datasets1 many mitochondrial reads from pangolin were identified, as well as from three other species, namely, human, mouse and tiger. Importantly, I only identified three polymorphic nucleotide sites between the five GD/P sequences.

A better understanding of the pathophysiology associated with COVID-19 is crucial to improve treatment modalities and to develop effective prevention strategies. Transcriptomic and proteomic data on the host response against SARS-CoV-2 still have anecdotic character; currently available data from other coronavirus infections are therefore a key source of information.

MethodsWe investigated selected molecular aspects of three human coronavirus (HCoV) infections, namely SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and HCoV-229E, through a network based-approach. A functional analysis of HCoV-host interactome was carried out in order to provide a theoretic host-pathogen interaction model for HCoV infections and in order to translate the results in prediction for SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.

The 3D model of S-glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 was compared to the structure of the corresponding SARS-CoV, HCoV-229E and MERS-CoV S-glycoprotein. SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-229E and the host interactome were inferred through published protein-protein interactions (PPI) as well as gene co-expression, triggered by HCoV S-glycoprotein in host cells.

ResultsAlthough the amino acid sequences of the S-glycoprotein were found to be different between the various HCoV, the structures showed high similarity, but the best 3D structural overlap shared by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, consistent with the shared ACE2 predicted receptor. The host interactome, linked to the S-glycoprotein of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, mainly highlighted innate immunity pathway components, such as Toll Like receptors, cytokines and chemokines.

At a molecular level, the bottleneck for the infection is the binding of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike protein to ACE2, an enzyme exposed on human cell membranes. Several experimental structures of the ACE2:RBD complex have been made available, however they offer only a static description of the arrangements of the molecules in either the free or bound states. In order to gain a dynamic description of the binding process that is key to infection, we use molecular simulations with a coarse grained model of the RBD and ACE2.

Current phylogenetic and phylodynamic approaches typically use consensus sequences, essentially assuming the presence of a single viral strain per host. Here, we analyze 621 bulk RNA sequencing samples and 7,540 consensus sequences from COVID-19 patients, and identify multiple strains of the virus, SARS-CoV-2, in four major clades that are prevalent within and across hosts. In particular, we find evidence for (i) within-host diversity across phylogenetic clades, (ii) putative cases of recombination, multi-strain and/or superinfections as well as (iii) distinct strain profiles across geographical locations and time.

Our study reveals novel interaction data on the variants and SARS-CoV-2.

We here developed a new tool for analyzing virus-transcribed mRNAs, not virus copy numbers, in the data of conventional and single-cell RNA-sequencing of human cells. Our pipeline, named VIRTUS (VIRal Transcript Usage Sensor), was able to detect 763 viruses including herpesviruses, retroviruses, and even SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), and quantify their transcripts in the sequence data. This tool thus enabled simultaneously detecting infected cells, the composition of multiple viruses within the cell, and the endogenous host gene expression profile of the cell. This bioinformatics method would be instrumental in addressing the possible effects of covertly infecting viruses on certain diseases and developing new treatments to target such viruses.

The first macrodomain, Mac1, is conserved throughout CoVs, and binds to and hydrolyzes mono-ADP-ribose (MAR) from target proteins. Mac1 likely counters host-mediated anti-viral ADP-ribosylation, a posttranslational modification that is part of the host response to viral infections. Mac1 is essential for pathogenesis in multiple animal models of CoV infection, implicating it as a virulence factor and potential therapeutic target. Here we report the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 in complex with ADP-ribose. SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV Mac1 exhibit similar structural folds and all 3 proteins bound to ADP-ribose with low M affinities. Importantly, using ADP-ribose detecting binding reagents in both a gel-based assay and novel ELISA assays, we demonstrated de-MARylating activity for all 3 CoV Mac1 proteins, with the SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 protein leading to a more rapid loss of substrate compared to the others. In addition, none of these enzymes could hydrolyze poly-ADP-ribose. We conclude that the SARS-CoV-2 and other CoV Mac1 proteins are MAR-hydrolases with similar functions, indicating that compounds targeting CoV Mac1 proteins may have broad anti-CoV activity.

IMPORTANCESARS-CoV-2 has recently emerged into the human population and has led to a worldwide pandemic of COVID-19 that has caused greater than 900 thousand deaths worldwide. With, no currently approved treatments, novel therapeutic strategies are desperately needed. All coronaviruses encode for a highly conserved macrodomain (Mac1) that binds to and removes ADP-ribose adducts from proteins in a dynamic post-translational process increasingly recognized as an important factor that regulates viral infection. The macrodomain is essential for CoV pathogenesis and may be a novel therapeutic target. Thus, understanding its biochemistry and enzyme activity are critical first steps for these efforts. Here we report the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 in complex with ADP-ribose, and describe its ADP-ribose binding and hydrolysis activities in direct comparison to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV Mac1 proteins.

Lethal complications are caused by damage and failure of vital organs that express high levels of ACE2, including the lungs, the heart and the kidneys. Here, we established a high-throughput drug screening strategy to identify therapeutic candidates that reduce ACE2 levels in human embryonic stem cell (hESC) derived cardiac cells.

To overcome these limitations, we propose that elucidation and pharmacologic targeting of host cell Master Regulator proteins--whose aberrant activities govern the reprogramed state of infected-coronavirus cells--presents unique opportunities to develop novel mechanism-based therapeutic approaches to antiviral therapy, either as monotherapy or as a complement to established treatments. Specifically, we propose that a small module of host cell Master Regulator proteins (ViroCheckpoint) is hijacked by the virus to support its efficient replication and release. Conventional methodologies are not well suited to elucidate these potentially targetable proteins. By using the VIPER network-based algorithm, we successfully interrogated 12h, 24h, and 48h signatures from Calu-3 lung adenocarcinoma cells infected with SARS-CoV, to elucidate the time-dependent reprogramming of host cells and associated Master Regulator proteins. We used the NYS CLIA-certified Darwin OncoTreat algorithm, with an existing database of RNASeq profiles following cell perturbation with 133 FDA-approved and 195 late-stage experimental compounds, to identify drugs capable of virtually abrogating the virus-induced Master Regulator signature.

Forty-four S2P-specific monoclonal antibodies were generated, three of which bound to the receptor binding domain (RBD). The antibodies were minimally mutated from germline and were derived from different B cell lineages. Only two antibodies displayed neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 pseudo-virus. The most potent antibody bound the RBD in a manner that prevented binding to the ACE2 receptor, while the other bound outside the RBD. Our study indicates that the majority of antibodies against the viral envelope spike that were generated during the first weeks of COVID-19 infection are non-neutralizing and target epitopes outside the RBD. Antibodies that disrupt the SARS-CoV-2 spike-ACE2 interaction can potently neutralize the virus without undergoing extensive maturation. Such antibodies have potential preventive/therapeutic potential and can serve as templates for vaccine-design.

IN BRIEFSARS-CoV-2 infection leads to expansion of diverse B cells clones against the viral spike glycoprotein (S). The antibodies bind S with high affinity despite being minimally mutated. Thus, the development of neutralizing antibody responses by vaccination will require the activation of certain naive B cells without requiring extensive somatic mutation.

In addition, these methods have been recommended by the WHO for laboratory diagnosis. Since all these protocols are based on the use of fluorogenic probes and one-step reagents (cDNA synthesis followed by PCR amplification in the same tube), these techniques can be difficult to perform given the limited supply of reagents in low and middle income countries. In the interest of economy, time and availability of chemicals and consumables, the SYBR Green-based detection was implemented to establish a convenient assay. Therefore, we adapted one of WHO recommended Taqman-based one-step real time PCR protocols (from the University of Hong Kong) to SYBR Green. Our results suggest that SYBR-Green detection represents a reliable cost-effective alternative to increase the testing capacity.",1,411,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.13.093609v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.13.093609v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2020.05.13.093609.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Aiming to understand a host genetic component of COVID-19, we focused on variants in genes encoding proteases and genes involved in innate immunity that could be important for susceptibility and resistance to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Analysis of sequence data of coding regions of FURIN, PLG, PRSS1, TMPRSS11a, MBL2 and OAS1 genes in 143 unrelated individuals from Serbian population identified 22 variants with potential functional effect. In silico analyses (PolyPhen-2, SIFT, MutPred2 and Swiss-Pdb Viewer) predicted that 10 variants could impact the structure and/or function of proteins. These protein-altering variants (p.Gly146Ser in FURIN; p.Arg261His and p.Ala494Val in PLG; p.Asn54Lys in PRSS1; p.Arg52Cys, p.Gly54Asp and p.Gly57Glu in MBL2; p.Arg47Gln, p.Ile99Val and p.Arg130His in OAS1) may have predictive value for inter-individual differences in the response to the SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Next, we performed comparative population analysis for the same variants using extracted data from the 1000 genomes project. Population genetic variability was assessed using delta MAF and Fst statistics. Our study pointed to 7 variants in PLG, TMPRSS11a, MBL2 and OAS1 genes with noticeable divergence in allelic frequencies between populations worldwide. Three of them, all in MBL2 gene, were predicted to be damaging, making them the most promising population-specific markers related to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Comparing allelic frequencies between Serbian and other populations, we found that the highest level of genetic divergence related to selected loci was observed with African, followed by East Asian, Central and South American and South Asian populations. When compared with European populations, the highest divergence was observed with Italian population.

In conclusion, we identified 4 variants in genes encoding proteases (FURIN, PLG and PRSS1) and 6 in genes involved in the innate immunity (MBL2 and OAS1) that might be relevant for the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.",1,443,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.13.093690v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.13.093690v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2020.05.13.093690.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Tests must include fail-safe controls that affirmatively report the presence of intact RNA and demonstrate success of all steps of the assay. A result of ""no virus signal"" is insufficient for clinical interpretation: controls must also say ""The reaction worked as intended and would have found virus if present."" Unfortunately, a widely used test specified by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) incorporates a control that does not perform as intended and claimed. Detecting SARS-CoV-2 with this assay requires both intact RNA and successful reverse transcription. The CDC-specified control does not require either of these, due to its inability to differentiate human genomic DNA from reverse-transcribed RNA. Patient DNA is copurified from nasopharyngeal swabs during clinically-approved RNA extraction and is sufficient to return an ""extraction control success"" signal using the CDC design. As such, this assay fails-unsafe: truly positive patient samples return a false-negative result of ""no virus detected, control succeeded"" following any of several readily-encountered mishaps. This problem affects tens-of-millions of patients worth of shipped assays, but many of these flawed reagents have not yet been used. There is an opportunity to improve this important diagnostic tool. As demonstrated here, a re-designed transcript-specific control correctly monitors sample collection, extraction, reverse transcription, and qPCR detection. This approach can be rapidly implemented and will help reduce truly positive patients from being incorrectly given the all-clear.

A safe and effective vaccine is desperately needed to prevent the continued spread of SARS-CoV-2; yet, rational vaccine design efforts are currently hampered by the lack of knowledge regarding viral epitopes targeted during an immune response, and the need for more in-depth knowledge on betacoronavirus immunology. To that end, we developed a computational workflow using a series of open-source algorithms and webtools to analyze the proteome of SARS-CoV-2 and identify putative T cell and B cell epitopes. Using increasingly stringent selection criteria to select peptides with significant HLA promiscuity and predicted antigenicity, we identified 41 potential T cell epitopes (5 HLA class I, 36 HLA class II) and 6 potential B cell epitopes, respectively. Docking analysis and binding predictions demonstrated enrichment for peptide binding to HLA-B (class I) and HLA-DRB1 (class II) molecules. Overlays of predicted B cell epitopes with the structure of the viral spike (S) glycoprotein revealed that 4 of 6 epitopes were located in the receptor-binding domain of the S protein. To our knowledge, this is the first study to comprehensively analyze all 10 (structural, non-structural and accessory) proteins from SARS-CoV-2 using predictive algorithms to identify potential targets for vaccine development.

Significance StatementThe novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 recently emerged from China, rapidly spreading and ushering in a global pandemic. Despite intensive research efforts, our knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 immunology and the proteins targeted by the immune response remains relatively limited, making it difficult to rationally design candidate vaccines. We employed a suite of bioinformatic tools, computational algorithms, and structural modeling to comprehensively analyze the entire SARS-CoV-2 proteome for potential T cell and B cell epitopes. Utilizing a set of stringent selection criteria to filter peptide epitopes, we identified 41 T cell epitopes (5 HLA class I, 36 HLA class II) and 6 B cell epitopes that could serve as promising targets for peptide-based vaccine development against this emerging global pathogen.",1,414,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.14.093757v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.14.093757v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2020.05.14.093757.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

We herein study the structural order-disorder propensity and the rates of evolution of these two proteins to characterize their B cell and T cell epitopes, previously suggested to contribute to immune response caused by SARS-CoV-2 infections. We first analyzed the rates of evolution along the sequences of spike and nucleocapsid proteins in relation to the spatial locations of their epitopes. For this purpose, we compared orthologs from seven human coronaviruses: SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1. We then focus on the local, structural order-disorder propensities of the protein regions where the SARS-CoV-2 epitopes are located. We show that the vast majority of nucleocapsid protein epitopes overlap the RNA-binding and dimerization domains and some of them are characterized by low rates of evolutions. Similarly, spike protein epitopes are preferentially located in regions that are predicted to be ordered and well-conserved, in correspondence of the heptad repeats 1 and 2. Interestingly, both the receptor-binding motif to ACE2 and the fusion peptide of spike protein are characterized by high rates of evolution, probably to overcome host immunity.

Using a suite of statistical, population genetics, and theoretical approaches, we show that the globally most represented spike protein variant (i.e., the G clade, A [-&gt;] G nucleotide change at genomic position 23,403; D [-&gt;] G amino acid change at spike protein position 614) i) underwent a significant demographic expansion in most countries not explained by stochastic effects or enhanced pathogenicity; ii) affects the spike S1/S2 furin-like site increasing its conformational plasticity (short range effect), and iii) modifies the internal motion of the receptor-binding domain affecting its cross-connection with other functional domains (long-range effect).

Our study unambiguously links the spread of the G614 with a non-random process, and we hypothesize that this process is related to the selective advantage produced by a specific structural modification of the spike protein.

As of May 2020, Turkey is among the top ten countries with the most cases. A comprehensive genomic characterization of the virus isolates in Turkey is yet to be carried out. Here, we built a phylogenetic tree with globally obtained 15,277 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genomes. We identified the subtypes based on the phylogenetic clustering in comparison with the previously annotated classifications. We performed a phylogenetic analysis of the first thirty SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated and sequenced in Turkey. We suggest that the first introduction of the virus to the country is earlier than the first reported case of infection. Virus genomes isolated from Turkey are dispersed among most types in the phylogenetic tree. We find two of the seventeen sub-clusters enriched with the isolates of Turkey, which likely have spread expansively in the country.

This clinical figure is significantly different from that of anosmia after upper respiratory infection, which occurs in only a small proportion of patients and does not recover or requires months to recover. The background mechanisms of COVID-19 induced olfactory dysfunction have not been elucidated.Methods To address the unique pathophysiology of olfactory dysfunction associated with COVID-19, we examined the existence and distribution of ACE2 (virus binding receptor), TMPRSS2 and Furin (proteases to facilitate virus entry) in the nasal mucosa, composed of the respiratory mucosa (RM) and olfactory mucosa (OM), and the olfactory bulb (OB) in mouse and human tissues by immunohistochemistry and gene analyses.Results Ace2, Tmprss2, and Furin gene expressions were confirmed in the nasal mucosa and OB. ACE2 was widely expressed all in the RM, OM and OB. Co-expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and Furin was observed in the RM including the RE and subepithelial glands and in the OM, especially in the supporting cells on the olfactory epithelium and the Bowman’s glands. Notably, the olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) in the OM were positive for ACE2 but almost negative for TMPRSS2 and Furin. The cells in the OB expressed ACE2 strongly and Furin weakly and did not express TMPRSS2.Conclusions ACE2 was widely expressed in the RM, OM and OB, but TMPRSS2 and Furin were expressed in certain types of cells and were absent in the ORNs. These findings, together with clinically reported ones, suggest that COVID-19 related anosmia can occur due to mainly sensorineural and central dysfunction and, to some extent, conductive olfactory dysfunction. That the ORNs express ACE2 but not TMPRSS2 or Furin may explain the early recovery of anosmia.Short Summary Protein expression patterns of ACE2, TMPRSS, and Furin suggest that COVID-19 related anosmia can occur due to mainly sensorineural dysfunction without olfactory neuronal damage.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",1,117,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.15.097352v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.15.097352v2.full.pdf,_10.1101_2020.05.15.097352.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the Coronaviridae family, which is transmitted from animal to human and because of being contagious, further it transmitted human to human. Recently, the World Health Organization (WHO) has announced the infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, which is known as coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-2019) as a global pandemic. But, no specific medications are available for the treatment of COVID-19 so far. As a corollary, there is a need for a potential vaccine to impede the progression of the disease. Lately, it has been documented that the nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for viral replication as well as interferes with host immune responses. We have comparatively analyzed the sequences of N protein of SARS-CoV-2 for the identification of core attributes and analyzed the ancestry through phylogenetic analysis. Subsequently, we have predicted the most immunogenic epitope for T-cell as well as B-cell. Importantly, our investigation mainly focused on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I potential peptides and NTASWFTAL interacted with most human leukocyte antigen (HLA) that are encoded by MHC class I molecules.

Broad spectrum antiviral drugs have a particular advantage when dealing with rapid disease outbreaks, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. Since viruses are completely dependent on internal cell mechanisms, they must cross cell membranes during their lifecycle, creating a dependence on processes involving membrane dynamics. Thus, in this study we examined whether the synthesis of glycosphingolipids, biologically active components of cell membranes, can serve as an antiviral therapeutic target. We examined the antiviral effect of two specific inhibitors of GlucosylCeramide synthase (GCS); (i) Genz-123346, an analogue of the FDA-approved drug Cerdelga(R), (ii) GENZ-667161, an analogue of venglustat which is currently under phase III clinical trials. We found that both GCS inhibitors inhibit the replication of four different enveloped RNA viruses of different genus, organ-target and transmission route: (i) Neuroinvasive Sindbis virus (SVNI), (ii) West Nile virus (WNV), (iii) Influenza A virus, and (iv) SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, GCS inhibitors significantly increase the survival rate of SVNI-infected mice. Our data suggest that GCS inhibitors can potentially serve as a broad-spectrum antiviral therapy and should be further examined in preclinical and clinical trial. Analogues of the specific compounds tested have already been studied clinically, implying they can be fast-tracked for public use. With the current COVID-19 pandemic, this may be particularly relevant to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

We find support for three SARS-CoV-2 lineages co-circulating, each with significantly different demographic dynamics concordant with known epidemiological factors. For example, Lineage C emerged in Europe with a high growth rate in late February, just prior to the exponential increase in cases in several European countries. Mutations that characterize Lineage C in particular are non-synonymous and occur in functionally important gene regions responsible for viral replication and cell entry.

The innate immune response is critical for protection against Coronaviruses. However, little is known about the interplay between the innate immune system and SARS-CoV-2. Here, we modeled SARS-CoV-2 infection using primary human airway epithelial (pHAE) cultures, which are maintained in an air-liquid interface. We found that SARS-CoV-2 infects and replicates in pHAE cultures and is directionally released on the apical, but not basolateral surface. Transcriptional profiling studies found that infected pHAE cultures had a molecular signature dominated by pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokine induction, including IL-6, TNF, CXCL8. We also identified NF-{kappa}B and ATF4 transcription factors as key drivers of this pro-inflammatory cytokine response. Surprisingly, we observed a complete lack of a type I or III IFN induction during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Pre-treatment or post-treatment with type I and III IFNs dramatically reduced virus replication in pHAE cultures and this corresponded with an upregulation of antiviral effector genes. Our findings demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 induces a strong pro-inflammatory cytokine response yet blocks the production of type I and III IFNs. Further, SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to the effects of type I and III IFNs, demonstrating their potential utility as therapeutic options to treat COVID-19 patients.

IMPORTANCEThe current pandemic of respiratory illness, COVID-19, is caused by a recently emerged coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2. This virus infects airway and lung cells causing fever, dry cough, and shortness of breath. Severe cases of COVID-19 can result in lung damage, low blood oxygen levels, and even death. As there are currently no vaccines or antivirals approved for use in humans, studies of the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection are urgently needed. SARS-CoV-2 infection of primary human airway epithelial cultures induces a strong pro-inflammatory cytokine response yet blocks the production of type I and III IFNs.

A modular biosafety level 2+ laboratory optimised for automated RT-qPCR COVID-19 testing based on a standard 40ft shipping container. Using open-source liquid-handling robots and RNA extraction reagents we demonstrate a reproducible workflow for RT-qPCR COVID-19 testing. With five OT2 liquid handlers, a single CONTAIN unit reaches a maximum daily testing capacity of 2400 tests/day. We validate this workflow for automated RT-qPCR testing, using both synthetic SARS-CoV-2 samples and patient samples from a local NHS hospital. Finally, we discuss the suitability of CONTAIN and its flexibility in a range of diagnostic testing scenarios including high-density urban environments and mobile response units.

This has led to speculations that some lineages of SARS-CoV-2 may be evolving towards higher transmissibility. The most plausible candidate mutations under putative natural selection are those which have emerged repeatedly and independently (homoplasies). Here, we formally test whether any of the recurrent mutations that have been observed in SARS-CoV-2 are significantly associated with increased viral transmission. To do so, we develop a phylogenetic index to quantify the relative number of descendants in sister clades with and without a specific allele. We apply this index to a carefully curated set of recurrent mutations identified within a dataset of 46,723 SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated from patients worldwide. We do not identify a single recurrent mutation in this set convincingly associated with increased viral transmission. Instead, recurrent SARS-CoV-2 mutations currently in circulation appear to be evolutionary neutral.

These symptoms and the associated laboratory values strongly resemble toxic shock syndrome, an escalation of the cytotoxic adaptive immune response triggered upon the binding of pathogenic superantigens to MHCII molecules and T cell receptors (TCRs). Here, we used structure-based computational models to demonstrate that the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) exhibits a high-affinity motif for binding TCR, interacting closely with both the - and {beta}-chains variable domains complementarity-determining regions. The binding epitope on S harbors a sequence motif unique to SARS-CoV-2 (not present in any other SARS coronavirus), which is highly similar in both sequence and structure to bacterial superantigens. Further examination revealed that this interaction between the virus and human T cells is strengthened in the context of a recently reported rare mutation (D839Y/N/E) from a European strain of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the interfacial region includes selected residues from a motif shared between the SARS viruses from the 2003 and 2019 pandemics, which has intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-like character. These data suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 S may act as a superantigen to drive the development of MIS-C as well as cytokine storm in adult COVID-19 patients, with important implications for the development of therapeutic approaches.

SignificanceAlthough children have been largely spared from severe COVID-19 disease, a rare hyperinflammatory syndrome has been described in Europe and the East Coast of the United States, termed Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MISC). The symptoms and diagnostic lab values of MIS-C resemble those of toxic shock, typically caused by pathogenic superantigens stimulating excessive activation of the adaptive immune system. We show that SARS-CoV-2 spike has a sequence and structure motif highly similar to those of bacterial superantigens, and may directly bind to the T cell receptors. This sequence motif, not present in other coronaviruses, may explain the unique potential for SARS-CoV-2 to cause both MIS-C and the cytokine storm observed in adult COVID-19 patients.",1,487,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.21.109272v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.21.109272v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2020.05.21.109272.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

One of the greatest barriers to the development of effective therapeutic agents to treat influenza, coronaviruses, and many other infections of the respiratory tract is the absence of a robust preclinical model. Preclinical studies currently rely on high-throughput, low-fidelity in vitro screening with cell lines and/or low-throughput animal models that often provide a poor correlation to human clinical responses. Here, we introduce a human primary airway epithelial cell-based model integrated into a high-throughput platform where tissues are cultured at an air-liquid interface (PREDICT96-ALI). We present results on the application of this platform to influenza and coronavirus infections, providing multiple readouts capable of evaluating viral infection kinetics and potentially the efficacy of therapeutic agents in an in vitro system. Several strains of influenza A virus are shown to successfully infect the human primary cell-based airway tissue cultured at an air-liquid interface (ALI), and as a proof-of-concept, the effect of the antiviral oseltamivir on one strain of Influenza A is evaluated. Human coronaviruses NL63 (HCoV-NL63) and SARS-CoV-2 enter host cells via ACE2 and utilize the protease TMPRSS2 for protein priming, and we confirm expression of both in our ALI model. We also demonstrate coronavirus infection in this system with HCoV-NL63, observing sufficient viral propagation over 96 hours post-infection to indicate successful infection of the primary cell-based model. This new capability has the potential to address a gap in the rapid assessment of therapeutic efficacy of various small molecules and antiviral agents against influenza and other respiratory viruses including coronaviruses.",1,522,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.23.112797v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.23.112797v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2020.05.23.112797.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

We have developed a mass-spectrometry based method for the detection of the SARS CoV-2 virus in nasopharynx epithelial swabs, based on the detection of the viral nucleocapsid N protein. The N protein of the SARS-COV-2 virus, the most abundant protein in the virion, is the best candidate for mass-spectrometric detection of the infection, and MS-based detection of several peptides from the SARS-COoV-2 nucleoprotein has been reported earlier by the Sinz group [4]. Our approach shows confident identification of the N protein in patient samples even with the lowest viral loads and a much simpler preparation procedure. Our main protocol consists of virus inactivation by heating and adding of isopropanol, and tryptic digestion of the proteins sedimented from the swabs followed by MS analysis. A set of unique peptides, produced as a result of proteolysis of the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein of SARS-CoV-2, is detected.

The viral spike (S) glycoprotein binds the receptor (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) ACE2 and promotes SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells. The trimeric S protein binds the receptor using the distal receptor-binding domain (RBD) causing conformational changes in S protein that allow priming by host cell proteases. Unravelling the dynamic structural features used by SARS-CoV-2 for entry might provide insights into viral transmission and reveal novel therapeutic targets. Using structures determined by X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM, we performed structural analysis and atomic comparisons of the different conformational states adopted by the SARS-CoV-2-RBD.

ResultsHere, we determined the key structural components induced by the receptor and characterized their intramolecular interactions. We show that {kappa}-helix (also known as polyproline II) is a predominant structure in the binding interface and in facilitating the conversion to the active form of the S protein. We demonstrate a series of conversions between switch-like {kappa}-helix and {beta}-strand, and conformational variations in a set of short -helices which affect the proximal hinge region. This conformational changes lead to an alternating pattern in conserved disulfide bond configurations positioned at the hinge, indicating a possible disulfide exchange, an important allosteric switch implicated in viral entry of various viruses, including HIV and murine coronavirus. The structural information presented herein enables us to inspect and understand the important dynamic features of SARS-CoV-2-RBD and propose a novel potential therapeutic strategy to block viral entry.

Materials and methods46 SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide sequences submitted from India were downloaded from the GISAID (39/46) or from NCBI (7/46) database. Phylogenetic study and analyses of mutation were based on the nine structural and non-structural genes of SARS-CoV-2 strains. Secondary structure of RdRP/NSP12 protein was predicted with respect to the novel A97V mutation.

ResultsPhylogenetic analyses revealed the evolution of ""genome-type clusters"" and adaptive selection of ""L"" type SARS-CoV-2 strains with genetic closeness to the bat SARS-like coronaviruses than pangolin or MERS-CoVs.

Little is known about the pattern of SARS-CoV-2 specific pre-existing memory T cells in human. Here, we first studied T cell responses to structural (nucleocapsid protein, NP) and non-structural (NSP-7 and NSP13 of ORF1) regions of SARS-CoV-2 in convalescent from COVID-19 (n=24). In all of them we demonstrated the presence of CD4 and CD8 T cells recognizing multiple regions of the NP protein. We then show that SARS-recovered patients (n=23), 17 years after the 2003 outbreak, still possess long-lasting memory T cells reactive to SARS-NP, which displayed robust cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 NP. Surprisingly, we observed a differential pattern of SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell immunodominance in individuals with no history of SARS, COVID-19 or contact with SARS/COVID-19 patients (n=18). Half of them (9/18) possess T cells targeting the ORF-1 coded proteins NSP7 and 13, which were rarely detected in COVID-19- and SARS-recovered patients. Epitope characterization of NSP7-specific T cells showed recognition of protein fragments with low homology to ""common cold"" human coronaviruses but conserved among animal betacoranaviruses.

Thus, infection with betacoronaviruses induces strong and long-lasting T cell immunity to the structural protein NP.

Using a multidisciplinary approach, we identified and validated the hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitor simeprevir as an especially promising repurposable drug for treating COVID-19. Simeprevir potently reduces SARS-CoV-2 viral load by multiple orders of magnitude and synergizes with remdesivir in vitro. Mechanistically, we showed that simeprevir inhibits the main protease (Mpro) and unexpectedly the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Our results thus reveal the viral protein targets of simeprevir, and provide preclinical rationale for the combination of simeprevir and remdesivir for the pharmacological management of COVID-19 patients.

With the assistance of these information, a drug(s) can be identified to treat COVID-19. A detailed analysis of the human host response to SARS CoV 2 with expression profiling by high throughput sequencing has executed with primary human lung epithelium cell lines. Clustered genes annotation and gene network construction are performed with the help of String database. Among four cluster of genes from microarray data, cluster 1 is identified as basal cells with p= 1.37e-05 with 44 genes. Functional enrichment analysis of genes present in gene network has completed using String database, ToppFun online tool and NetworkAnalyst tool. For SARS CoV2 virus particles, keratin proteins, which are part of cytoskeleton structure of host cell, play a major role in cell to cell virus particle transmission. Among three types of cell- cell communication, only anchoring junction between basal cell membrane and basal lamina, is involved in this virus transmission. In this junction point, hemidesmosome structure play a vital role in virus spread from one cell to basal lamina in respiratory tract. In this protein complex structure, keratin, integrin and laminin proteins of host cell is used to promote the spread of virus infection into extracellular matrix.

Viruses are expected to quickly acquire beneficial mutations upon jumping to a new host species. Advantageous nucleotide substitutions can be identified by their parallel occurrence in multiple independent lineages and are likely to result in changes to protein sequences. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 is acquiring mutations more slowly than expected for neutral evolution, suggesting purifying selection is the dominant mode of evolution during the initial phase of the pandemic. However, several parallel mutations arose in multiple independent lineages and may provide a fitness advantage over the ancestral genome. We propose plausible reasons for several of the most frequent mutations. The absence of mutations in other genome regions suggests essential components of SARS-CoV-2 that could be the target of drug development. Overall this study provides genomic insights into how SARS-CoV-2 has adapted and will continue to adapt to humans.

SUMMARYIn this study we sought signals of evolution to identify how the SARS-CoV-2 genome has adapted at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic. We find that the genome is largely undergoing purifying selection that maintains its ancestral sequence. However, we identified multiple positions on the genome that appear to confer an adaptive advantage based on their repeated evolution in independent lineages.

The test measures the capacity of serum or purified antibodies to neutralize a recombinant Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV) encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. This recombinant virus (VSV-SARS-CoV-2-S-{Delta}19CT) induces fusion in Vero cell monolayers, which is detected as luciferase signal using a dual split protein (DSP) reporter system. VSV-SARS-CoV-2-S-{Delta}19CT infection was blocked by monoclonal -SARS-CoV-2-spike antibodies and by plasma or serum from SARS-CoV-2 convalescing individuals. The assay exhibited 100% specificity in validation tests, and across all tests zero false positives were detected. In blinded analyses of 230 serum samples, only two unexpected results were observed based on available clinical data. We observed a perfect correlation between results from our assay and 80 samples that were also assayed using a commercially available ELISA. To quantify the magnitude of the anti-viral response, we generated a calibration curve by adding stepped concentrations of -SARS-CoV-2-spike monoclonal antibody to pooled SARS-CoV-2 seronegative serum. Using the calibration curve and a single optimal 1:100 serum test dilution, we reliably measured neutralizing antibody levels in each test sample. Virus neutralization units (VNUs) calculated from the assay correlated closely (p < 0.0001) with PRNTEC50 values determined by plaque reduction neutralization test against a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the IMMUNO-COV assay accurately quantitates SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies in human sera and therefore is a potentially valuable addition to the currently available serological tests. The assay can provide vital information for comparing immune responses to the various SARS-CoV-2 vaccines that are currently in development, or for evaluating donor eligibility in convalescent plasma therapy studies.",1,474,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.26.117549v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.26.117549v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2020.05.26.117549.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Despite the implementation of new automated detection systems, and previous efficiencies such as barcoding, electronic data transfer and extensive robotics, throughput capacities have struggled to meet the demand. Sample pooling has been suggested as an additional strategy to further address this need. The greatest concern with this approach in a clinical setting is the potential for reduced sensitivity, particularly the risk of false negative results when weak positive samples are pooled. To investigate this possibility, detection rates in pooled samples were evaluated, with extensive assessment of pools containing weak positive specimens. Additionally, the frequency of occurrence of weak positive samples across ten weeks of the pandemic were reviewed. Weak positive specimens were detected in all five-sample pools but failed to be detected in four of the 24 nine-sample pools tested. Weak positive samples comprised an average 16.5% of the positive specimens tested during the pandemic thus far, slightly increasing in frequency during later weeks. Other aspects of the testing process should be considered, however, such as accessioning and reporting, which are not streamlined and may be complicated by pooling procedures. Therefore, the impact on the entire laboratory process needs to be carefully assessed prior to implementing such a strategy.",1,483,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.26.118133v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.26.118133v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2020.05.26.118133.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

While hACE2 transgenic mice support infection and pathogenesis,5 these mice are currently limited in availability and are restricted to a single genetic background. Here we report the development of a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 based on adeno associated virus (AAV)-mediated expression of hACE2. These mice support viral replication and antibody production and exhibit pathologic findings found in COVID-19 patients as well as non-human primate models.

We compared the performance of four rapid antigen detection tests for SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory samples. Immunochromatographic SARS-CoV-2 assays from RapiGEN, Liming bio, Savant, and Bioeasy were evaluated using universal transport medium containing naso-oropharyngeal swabs from suspected Covid-19 cases. The diagnostic accuracy was determined in comparison to SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. A total of 111 samples were included; 80 were RT-PCR positive. Median patients age was 40 years, 55% were female, and 88% presented within the first week after symptom onset. The evaluation of the Liming bio assay was discontinued due to insufficient performance. The overall sensitivity values of RapiGEN, Liming bio, and Bioeasy tests were 62.0% (CI95% 51.0-71.9), 16.7% (CI95% 10.0-26.5), and 85.0% (CI95% 75.6-91.2), respectively, with specificities of 100%. Sensitivity was significantly higher in samples with high viral loads (RapiGEN, 84.9%; Bioeasy, 100%). The study highlighted the significant heterogeneity of test performance among evaluated assays, which might have been influenced by the use of a non-validated sample material. The high sensitivity of some tests demonstrated that rapid antigen detection has the potential to serve as an alternative diagnostic method, especially in patients presenting with high viral loads in early phases of infection. This is particularly important in situations with limited access to RT-PCR or prolonged turnaround time.

We recently identified immunogenic epitopes within CVB3 viral protein 1 that induce anti-viral T cell responses in mouse models of CVB infections. In our investigations to determine the protective responses of the viral epitopes, we unexpectedly noted that animals immunized with complete Freunds adjuvant (CFA) alone and later challenged with CVB3 were completely protected against myocarditis. Similarly, the pancreatitis-inducing ability of CVB3 was remarkably reduced to only 10% in the CFA group as opposed to 73.3% in the control group that received no CFA. Additionally, no mortalities were noted in the CFA group, whereas 40% of control animals died during the course of 21 days post-infection with CVB3. Taken together, our data suggest that the adjuvant effects of CFA may be sufficient for protection against CVB infections.

Studying the evolution and transmission patterns in different countries is crucial to implement effective strategies for disease control and prevention. In this work, we present the full genome sequence for 17 SARS-CoV-2 isolates corresponding to the earliest sampled cases in Mexico. Global and local phylogenomics, coupled with mutational analysis, consistently revealed that these viral sequences are distributed within 2 known lineages, the SARS-CoV-2 lineage A/G, containing mostly sequences from North America, and the lineage B/S containing mainly sequences from Europe. Based on the exposure history of the cases and on the phylogenomic analysis, we characterized fourteen independent introduction events. Additionally, three cases with no travel history were identified. We found evidence that two of these cases represent local transmission cases occurring in Mexico during mid-March 2020, denoting the earliest events described in the country. Within this Mexican cluster, we also identified an H49Y amino acid change in the spike protein. This mutation is a homoplasy occurring independently through time and space, and may function as a molecular marker to follow on any further spread of these viral variants throughout the country. Our results depict the general picture of the SARS-CoV-2 variants introduced at the beginning of the outbreak in Mexico, setting the foundation for future surveillance efforts.

IMPORTANCEUnderstanding the introduction, spread and establishment of SARS-CoV-2 within distinct human populations is crucial to implement effective control strategies as well as the evolution of the pandemics. In this work, we describe that the initial virus strains introduced in Mexico came from Europe and the United States and the virus was circulating locally in the country as early as mid-March.

Owing to unavailability of the vaccine, we propose a de novo synthesised avian orthoavulavirus 1 (AOaV-1)-based topical respiratory vaccine candidate against CoVID-19. Avirulent strain of Newcastle disease virus, proto-type virus of AOaV-1, was engineered to express full length spike (S) glycoprotein which is highly neutralizing and major protective antigen of the SARS-CoV-2. Broad-scale in vitro characterization of recombinant vaccine candidate demonstrated efficient co-expression of the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) of AOaV-1 and S protein of SARS-CoV-2, and comparable replication kinetics were observed in cell culture model. The recombinant vaccine candidate virus actively replicated and spread within cells independently of exogenous trypsin. Interestingly, incorporation of S protein of SARS-CoV-2 into the recombinant AOaV-1 particles attributed the sensitivity to anti-SARS-CoV-2 antiserum and more prominently to anti-AOaV-1 antiserum. Finally, our results demonstrated that the recombinant vaccine vector stably expressed S protein after multiple propagation in chicken embryonated eggs, and this expression did not significantly impact the in vitro growth characteristics of the recombinant.

The virus enters host cells through an interaction between the spike glycoprotein and the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. Directly preventing this interaction presents an attractive possibility for suppressing SARS-CoV-2 replication. Here we report the isolation and characterization of an alpaca-derived single domain antibody fragment, Ty1, that specifically targets the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike, directly preventing ACE2 engagement. The nanobody binds with high affinity in the low nM range to the RBD, occluding ACE2. A cryo-electron microscopy structure of the bound complex at 2.9 Å resolution reveals that Ty1 binds to an epitope on the RBD accessible in both the ‘up’ and ‘down’ conformations and that Ty1 sterically hinders RBD-ACE2 binding. This 12.8 kDa nanobody does not need an Fc domain to neutralize SARS-CoV-2, and can be expressed in high quantities in bacteria, presenting opportunities for manufacturing at scale. Ty1 is therefore an excellent candidate as an intervention against COVID-19.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",1,95,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.02.130161v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.02.130161v2.full.pdf,_10.1101_2020.06.02.130161.txt,1,general-purpose repository,1,333  data along with analysis r scripts will be made publicly available via github and/or datadryad.,333  data along with analysis r scripts will be made publicly available via github and/or datadryad.

In agreement with an experimental study, we find a high affinity of the hexapeptide to the binding interface between the spike receptor protein and ACE2, which we investigate using 20 independent equilibrium MD simulations over a total of 1 s and a 200 ns enhanced MD simulation. We then evaluate the effect of the hexapeptide on the aggregation process of the spike receptor protein to ACE2 in long-time enhanced MD simulations. In that set of simulations, we find that the spike receptor protein does not bind to ACE2 with the binding motif shown in experiments, but it rotates due to an electrostatic repulsion and forms a hydrophobic interface with ACE2. Surprisingly, we observe that the hexapeptide binds to the spike receptor domain, which has the effect that this protein only weakly attaches to ACE2, so that the activation of the spike protein receptor might be inhibited in this case. Our results indicate that the hexapeptide might be a possible treatment option which prevents the viral activation through the inhibition of the interaction between ACE2 and the spike receptor protein.

SIGNIFICANCEA novel coronavirus, CoV-19 and a later phenotype CoV-2 were identified as primary cause for a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS CoV-2). The spike (S) protein of CoV-2 is one target for the development of a vaccine to prevent the viral entry into human cells. The inhibition of the direct interaction between ACE2 and the S-protein could provides a suitable strategy to prevent the membrane fusion of CoV-2 and the viral entry into human cells. Using MD simulations, we investigate the assembly process of a Coronavirus Spike protein fragment, the hexapeptide YKYRYL on the ACE2 receptor and its inhibitzory effect on the aggregation and activation of the CoV-2 spike receptor protein at the same receptor protein.",1,438,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.03.132506v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.03.132506v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2020.06.03.132506.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

We assessed the immune memory of T cell responses using IFN{gamma} based assays with overlapping peptides spanning SARS-CoV-2 apart from ORF1.

Unlike RT-qPCR, SARS-CoV-2 Whole Genome Sequencing (cWGS) has the added advantage of identifying cryptic origins of the virus, and the extent of community-based transmissions versus new viral introductions, which can in turn influence public health policy decisions. However, practical and cost considerations of cWGS should be addressed before it can be widely implemented.

MethodsWe performed shotgun transcriptome sequencing using RNA extracted from nasopharyngeal swabs of patients with COVID-19, and compared it to targeted SARS-CoV-2 full genome amplification and sequencing with respect to virus detection, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. To track virus origin, we used open-source multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic tools to compare the assembled SARS-CoV-2 genomes to publicly available sequences.

ResultsWe show a significant improvement in whole genome sequencing data quality and viral detection using amplicon-based target enrichment of SARS-CoV-2. With enrichment, more than 99% of the sequencing reads mapped to the viral genome compared to an average of 0.63% without enrichment. Consequently, a dramatic increase in genome coverage was obtained using significantly less sequencing data, enabling higher scalability and significant cost reductions. We also demonstrate how SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences can be used to determine their possible origin through phylogenetic analysis including other viral strains.

Abundance of ACE2 mRNA was unchanged in any of the 4 tissues, but TMPRSS2 mRNA was significantly decreased in lungs.

The method has its roots in studies of disorder in metal alloys, and is adapted to describe the type and occurrence of structural motifs within the arrangement of viral coat proteins, captured by the value of the order parameter as a measure of disorder. A conventional approach to viral vaccine design consists of replicating select proteins to create a VLP designed to trigger an immune response while remaining non-infectious. Understanding variations between viruses and vaccine strains therefore tends to focus on differences between proteins, which can be characterized through genetic analysis. While such an approach provides vital information about the functioning and interactions of the proteins, it does not yet yield an early-stage pathway towards predicting the efficacy of a vaccine, and so large-scale clinical trials are required to obtain critical information. With the urgency associated with pandemics, including Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) originating from the SARS-CoV-2 virus, there is a need for earlier indications of whether a vaccine has the necessary characteristics. Application of the methodology to Dengue and influenza virus particles indicates that temperature and pH during incubation could potentially be exploited to fine-tune the order parameter of VLP-based vaccines to match the corresponding virus.

Worldwide concerted effort to identify viral genomic changes across different sub-types has identified several strong changes in the coding region. However, there have not been many studies focusing on the variations in the 5 and 3 untranslated regions and their consequences. Considering the possible importance of these regions in host mediated regulation of viral RNA genome, we wanted to explore the phenomenon.

MethodsTo have an idea of the global changes in 5 and 3-UTR sequences, we downloaded 8595 complete and high-coverage SARS-CoV2 genome sequence information from human host in FASTA format from Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) from 15 different geographical regions. Next, we aligned them using Clustal Omega software and investigated the UTR variants. We also looked at the putative host RNA binding protein (RBP) and microRNA binding sites in these regions by  RBPmap and  RNA22 v2 respectively. Expression status of selected RBPs and microRNAs were checked in lungs tissue.

ResultsWe identified 28 unique variants in SARS-CoV2 UTR region based on a minimum variant percentage cut-off of 0.5. Along with 241C>T change the important 5-UTR change identified was 187A>G, while 29734G>C, 29742G>A/T and 29774C>T were the most familiar variants of 3UTR among most of the continents. Furthermore, we found that despite of the variations in the UTR regions, binding of host RBP to them remains mostly unaltered, which further influenced the functioning of specific miRNAs.

ConclusionOur results, shows for the first time in SARS-Cov2 infection, a possible cross-talk between host RBPs-miRNAs and viral UTR variants, which ultimately could explain the mechanism of escaping host RNA decay machinery by the virus.

To this end, we created a construct expressing recombinant N fused to a N-terminal maltose binding protein tag which helps keep the oligomeric N soluble for purification. Using in vitro phase separation assays, we find that N is assembly-prone and phase separates avidly. Phase separation is modulated by addition of RNA and changes in pH and is disfavored at high concentrations of salt. Furthermore, N enters into in vitro phase separated condensates of full-length human hnRNPs (TDP-43, FUS, and hnRNPA2) and their low complexity domains (LCs). However, N partitioning into the LC of FUS, but not TDP-43 or hnRNPA2, requires cleavage of the solubilizing MBP fusion.

In particular, SARS-CoV-2 is currently a major threat to public health worldwide. However, no commercial vaccines against the coronaviruses that can infect humans are available. The spike (S) homotrimers bind to their receptors through the receptor-binding domain (RBD), which is believed to be a major target to block viral entry. In this study, we selected Alpha-coronavirus (HCoV-229E) and Beta-coronavirus (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) as models. Their RBDs were observed to adopt two different conformational states (lying or standing). Then, structural and immunological analyses were used to explore differences in the immune response with RBDs among these coronaviruses. Our results showed that more RBD-specific antibodies were induced by the S trimer with the RBD in the ""standing"" state (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) than the S trimer with the RBD in the ""lying"" state (HCoV-229E), and the affinity between the RBD-specific antibodies and S trimer was also higher in the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. In addition, we found that the ability of the HCoV-229E RBD to induce neutralizing antibodies was much lower and the intact and stable S1 subunit was essential for producing efficient neutralizing antibodies against HCoV-229E. Importantly, our results reveal different vaccine strategies for coronaviruses, and S-trimer is better than RBD as a target for vaccine development in Alpha-coronavirus. Our findings will provide important implications for future development of coronavirus vaccines.

ImportanceOutbreak of coronaviruses, especially SARS-CoV-2, poses a serious threat to global public health. Development of vaccines to prevent the coronaviruses that can infect humans has always been a top priority. Coronavirus spike (S) protein is considered as a major target for vaccine development. Currently, structural studies have shown that Alpha-coronavirus (HCoV-229E) and Beta-coronavirus (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) RBDs are in lying and standing state, respectively. Here, we tested the ability of S-trimer and RBD to induce neutralizing antibodies among these coronaviruses. Our results showed that Beta-CoVs RBDs are in a standing state, and their S proteins can induce more neutralizing antibodies targeting RBD. However, HCoV-229E RBD is in a lying state, and its S protein induces a low level of neutralizing antibody targeting RBD. Our results indicate that Alpha-coronavirus is more conducive to escape host immune recognition, and also provide novel ideas for the development of vaccines targeting S protein.",1,438,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.09.141580v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.09.141580v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2020.06.09.141580.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Complete understanding of COVID-19, the multi-faceted disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, requires suitable small animal models, as does the development and evaluation of vaccines and antivirals2. Because age-dependent differences of COVID-19 were identified in humans3, we compared the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection in young and aged Syrian hamsters. We show that virus replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract was independent of the age of the animals. However, older hamsters exhibited more pronounced and consistent weight loss. In situ hybridization in the lungs identified viral RNA in bronchial epithelium, alveolar epithelial cells type I and II, and macrophages. Histopathology revealed clear age-dependent differences, with young hamsters launching earlier and stronger immune cell influx than aged hamsters. The latter developed conspicuous alveolar and perivascular edema, indicating vascular leakage. In contrast, we observed rapid lung recovery at day 14 after infection only in young hamsters.

In the light of the urgent need to identify novel approaches to be used in the emergency phase, a largely explored strategy has been the repurpose of clinically available drugs as new antivirals, by targeting different viral proteins. In this paper, we describe a drug repurposing strategy based on a virtual screening of druggable pockets located in the central β-sheet core of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein RBD supported by in vitro tests identifying several steroidal derivatives as SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitors. Our results demonstrate that several potential binding sites exist in the SARS CoV-2 S protein, and that the occupancy of these pockets reduces the ability of the S protein RBD to bind to the ACE2 consensus in vitro. In particular, natural occurring and clinically available steroids as glycyrrhetinic and oleanolic acids, as well as the bile acids derivatives glyco-UDCA and obeticholic acid have been shown to be effective in preventing virus entry in the case of low viral load. All together, these results might help to define novel approaches to reduce the viral load by using SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitors.Competing Interest StatementThis paper was supported by a research grant by BAR Pharmaceuticals S.r.L. to the Department of Pharmacy of the University of Napoli Federico II and to the Department of Surgical and Biomedical Sciences, University of Perugia.

However, the molecular level understanding of the virus structure at different temperature is still not clear. Spike protein is the outermost structural protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus which interacts with the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), a human receptor, and enters the respiratory system. In this study, we performed an all atom molecular dynamics simulation to study the effect of temperature on the structure of the Spike protein. After 200ns of simulation at different temperatures, we came across some interesting phenomena exhibited by the protein. We found that the solvent exposed domain of Spike protein, namely S1, is more mobile than the transmembrane domain, S2. Structural studies implied the presence of several charged residues on the surface of N-terminal Domain of S1 which are optimally oriented at 10-30 {degrees}C. Bioinformatics analyses indicated that it is capable of binding to other human receptors and should not be disregarded. Additionally, we found that receptor binding motif (RBM), present on the receptor binding domain (RBD) of S1, begins to close around temperature of 40 {degrees}C and attains a completely closed conformation at 50 {degrees}C. The closed conformation disables its ability to bind to ACE2, due to the burying of its receptor binding residues. Our results clearly show that there are active and inactive states of the protein at different temperatures. This would not only prove beneficial for understanding the fundamental nature of the virus, but would be also useful in the development of vaccines and therapeutics.

These findings led us to evaluate the susceptibility of colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) patients to SARS-CoV-2 infection by investigation of ACE2 expression in their tumor tissues. The expression analysis revealed that both mRNA and protein levels of ACE2 had increased in colon cancer samples than normal group. Next, the prognosis analysis has indicated that the upregulation of ACE2 was not correlated with patient survival outcomes. Further assessment displayed the hypomethylation of the ACE2 gene promoter in COAD patients. Surprisingly, this methylation status has a strong negative correlation with ACE2 gene expression. The functional enrichment analysis of the genes that had similar expression patterns with ACE2 in colon cancer tissues demonstrated that they mainly enriched in Vitamin digestion and absorption, Sulfur relay system, and Fat digestion and absorption pathways. Finally, we found that ACE2 gene expression had a significant association with the immune cell infiltration levels in COAD patients. In conclusion, it has plausible that COAD patients are more likely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and experience severe injuries.

Understanding how they evolve to adapt or evade host immune responses is important in the effort to control the spread of COVID-19. Two AVPs that may shape viral genomes are the zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP) and the apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme-catalytic polypeptide-like 3 protein (APOBEC3). The former binds to CpG dinucleotides to facilitate the degradation of viral transcripts while the latter deaminates C into U residues leading to dysfunctional transcripts. We tested the hypothesis that both APOBEC3 and ZAP may act as primary selective pressures that shape the genome of an infecting coronavirus by considering a comprehensive number of publicly available genomes for seven coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS, Bovine CoV, Murine MHV, Porcine HEV, and Canine CoV). We show that coronaviruses that regularly infect tissues with abundant AVPs have CpG-deficient and U-rich genomes; whereas viruses that do not infect tissues with abundant AVPs do not share these sequence hallmarks.

Typically, SARS-CoV caused SARS pandemic in 2003 and SARS-CoV-2 caused the COVID-19 pandemic recently. Both viruses have been reported to originate from bats. Thus, direct or indirect interspecies transmission from bats to humans is required for the viruses to cause pandemics. Receptor utilization is a key factor determining the host range of viruses which is critical to the interspecies transmission. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, but only ACE2s of certain animals can be utilized by the viruses. Here, we employed pseudovirus cell-entry assay to evaluate the receptor-utilizing capability of ACE2s of 20 animals by the two viruses and found that SARS-CoV-2 utilized less ACE2s than SARS-CoV, indicating a narrower host range of SARS-CoV-2. Meanwhile, pangolin CoV, another SARS-related coronavirus highly homologous to SARS-CoV-2 in its genome, yet showed similar ACE2 utilization profile with SARS-CoV rather than SARS-CoV-2. To clarify the mechanism underlying the receptor utilization, we compared the amino acid sequences of the 20 ACE2s and found 5 amino acid residues potentially critical for ACE2 utilization, including the N-terminal 20th and 42nd amino acids that may determine the different receptor utilization of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin CoV.

This may be due in large part to the unclear immunopathological basis for the development of immune dysregulation and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in severe and critical patients. Specifically, it remains unknown whether the immunological features of the disease that have been identified so far are compartment-specific responses or general features of COVID-19. Additionally, readily detectable biological markers correlated with strata of disease severity that could be used to triage patients and inform treatment options have not yet been identified. Here, we leveraged publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing data to elucidate the common and compartment-specific immunological features of clinically severe COVID-19. We identified a number of transcriptional programs that are altered across the spectrum of disease severity, few of which are common between the lung and peripheral immune environments. In the lung, comparing severe and moderate patients revealed severity-specific responses of enhanced interferon, A20/I{kappa}B, IL-2, and IL-6 pathway signatures along with broad signaling activity of IFNG, SPP1, CCL3, CCL8, and IL18 across cell types. These signatures contrasted with features unique to ARDS observed in the blood compartment, which included depletion of interferon and A20/I{kappa}B signatures and a lack of IL-6 response. The cell surface marker S1PR1 was strongly upregulated in patients diagnosed with ARDS compared to non-ARDS patients in {gamma}{delta} T cells of the blood compartment, and we nominate S1PR1 as a potential marker for immunophenotyping ARDS in COVID-19 patients using flow cytometry.

As for other RNA viruses, genomic RNA structures are expected to play crucial roles in several steps of the coronavirus replication cycle.

Here, we performed RNA structure probing by SHAPE-MaP to obtain a single-base resolution secondary structure map of the full SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus genome. The SHAPE-MaP probing data recapitulate the previously described coronavirus RNA elements (5' UTR, ribosomal frameshifting element, and 3' UTR), and reveal new structures. Secondary structure-restrained 3D modeling of highly-structured regions across the SARS-CoV-2 genome allowed for the identification of several putative druggable pockets. Furthermore, [~]8% of the identified structure elements show significant covariation among SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses, hinting at their functionally-conserved role.

The Situation of COVID19A new infection respiratory disease was first observed in the month of December 2019, in Wuhan, situated in the Hubei province, China. Studies have indicated that the reason of this disease was the emergence of a genetically-novel coronavirus closely related to SARS-CoV. This coronavirus, now named as nCoV-19, is the reason behind the spread of this fatal respiratory disease, now named as COVID-19. The initial group of infections is supposedly linked with the Huanan seafood market, most likely due to animal contact. Eventually, human-to-human interaction occurred and resulted in the transmission of the virus to humans. [13].

Since then, nCoV-19 has been rapidly spreading within China and other parts of World. At the time of writing this article (mid-March 2020), COVID-19 has spread across 146 countries. A count of 164,837 cases have been confirmed of being diagnosed with COVID-19, and a total of 6470 deaths have occurred. The cumulative cases have been depicting a rising trend and the numbers are just increasing. WHO has declared COVID-19 to be a ""global health emergency"". [14].

Current Scenario and ObjectivesCurrently, research is being conducted on a massive level to understand the immunology and genetic characteristics of the disease. However, no cure or vaccine of nCoV-19 has been developed at the time of writing this article.

Though, nCoV-19 and SARS-CoV are almost genetically similar, the respiratory syndrome caused by both of them, COVID-19 and SARS respectively, are completely different. Studies have indicated that -

""SARS was more deadly but much less infectious than COVID-19"".

In the current study, SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was investigated for the presence of large scale internal RNA base pairing in its genome. This property, termed genome scale ordered RNA structure (GORS) has been previously associated with host persistence in other positive-strand RNA viruses, potentially through its shielding effect on viral RNA recognition in the cell. Genomes of SARS-CoV-2 were remarkably structured, with minimum folding energy differences (MFEDs) of 15%, substantially greater than previously examined viruses such as HCV (MFED 7-9%). High MFED values were shared with all coronavirus genomes analysed created by several hundred consecutive energetically favoured stem-loops throughout the genome. In contrast to replication-association RNA structure, GORS was poorly conserved in the positions and identities of base pairing with other sarbecoviruses - even similarly positioned stem-loops in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV rarely shared homologous pairings, indicative of more rapid evolutionary change in RNA structure than in the underlying coding sequences. Sites predicted to be base-paired in SARS-CoV-2 showed substantially less sequence diversity than unpaired sites, suggesting that disruption of RNA structure by mutation imposes a fitness cost on the virus which is potentially restrictive to its longer evolution. Although functionally uncharacterised, GORS in SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses represent important elements in their cellular interactions that may contribute to their persistence and transmissibility.",1,362,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.17.155200v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.17.155200v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2020.06.17.155200.txt,1,supplement,0,raw data listed in table s1,NA

However, it is still unclear why it was restricted to higher latitudes during the initial days and later cascaded in the tropics. Here, we analyzed 176 SARS-CoV-2 genomes across different latitudes and climate (Koppens climate) that provided insights about within species virus evolution and its relation to abiotic factors. Two genetically variant groups, named as G1 and G2 were identified, well defined by four mutations. The G1 group (ancestor), is mainly restricted to warm and moist, temperate climate (Koppens C climate) while its descendent G2 group surpasses the climatic restrictions of G1, initially cascading into neighboring cold climate (D) of higher latitudes and later into hot climate of the tropics (A). It appears that the gradation of temperate climate (Cfa-Cfb) to cold climate (Dfa-Dfb) drives the evolution of G1 into G2 variant group which later adapted to tropical climate (A) as well. It seems this virus followed inverse latitudinal gradient in the beginning due to its preference towards temperate (C) and cold climate (D). Our work elucidates virus evolutionary studies combined with climatic studies can provide crucial information about the pathogenesis and natural spreading pathways in such outbreaks which is hard to achieve through individual studies. Mutational insights gained may help design an efficacious vaccine.

Based on in silico screening followed by in vitro studies, here we report that the existing FDA-approved Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor, imatinib, inhibits SARS-CoV-2 with an IC50 of 130 nM. We provide evidence that although imatinib binds to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with an affinity at micromolar, i.e., 2.32 {+/-} 0.9 M levels, imatinib does not directly inhibit the spike RBD:ACE2 interaction - suggesting a Bcr-Abl kinase-mediated fusion inhibition mechanism is responsible for the inhibitory action.

Unfortunately, standard SARS-CoV-2 testing protocols are invasive and rely on numerous items that can be subject to supply chain bottlenecks, and as such are not suitable for frequent repeat testing. Specifically, personal protective equipment (PPE), nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs, the associated viral transport media (VTM), and kits for RNA isolation and purification have all been in short supply at various times during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 is spread through droplets and aerosols transmitted through person-to-person contact, and thus saliva may be a relevant medium for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection status. Here we describe a saliva-based testing method that bypasses the need for RNA isolation/purification. In experiments with inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus spiked into saliva, this method has a limit of detection of 500-1000 viral particles per mL, rivalling the standard NP swab method, and initial studies also show excellent performance with 100 clinical samples. This saliva-based process is operationally simple, utilizes readily available materials, and can be easily implemented by existing testing sites, thus allowing for high-throughput, rapid, and repeat testing of large populations.

To investigate the possible role of pangolins as a source of potential zoonoses, we collected throat and rectal swabs from 334 Sunda pangolins (Manis javanica) confiscated in Peninsular Malaysia and Sabah between August 2009 and March 2019. Total nucleic acid was extracted for viral molecular screening using conventional PCR protocols used to routinely identify known and novel viruses in extensive prior sampling (>50,000 mammals). No sample yielded a positive PCR result for any of the targeted viral families - Coronaviridae, Filoviridae, Flaviviridae, Orthomyxoviridae and Paramyxoviridae. In light of recent reports of coronaviruses including a SARS-CoV-2 related virus in Sunda pangolins in China, the lack of any coronavirus detection in our  upstream market chain samples suggests that these detections in  downstream animals more plausibly reflect exposure to infected humans, wildlife or other animals within the wildlife trade network.

We describe here the singular metabolic background that creates a bottleneck constraining coronaviruses to evolve towards likely attenuation in the long term. Cytidine triphosphate (CTP) is at the crossroad of the biosynthetic processes that allow the virus to multiply. This is because CTP is in demand for three essential steps. It is a building block of the virus genome, it is required for synthesis of the cytosine-based liponucleotide precursors of the viral envelope and, finally, it is a critical building block of the host transfer RNAs synthesis. The CCA 3-end of all the transfer RNAs required to translate the RNA genome and further transcripts into the proteins used to build active virus copies is not coded in the human genome. It must be synthesized de novo from CTP and ATP. Furthermore, intermediary metabolism is built on compulsory steps of synthesis and salvage of cytosine-based metabolites via uridine triphosphate (UTP) that keep limiting CTP availability. As a consequence, accidental replication errors tend to replace cytosine by uracil in the genome, unless recombination events allow the sequence to return to its ancestral sequences. We document some of the consequences of this situation in the function of viral proteins.

Our simulations strongly suggest that Remdesivir triphosphate (the active form of drug) is incorporated into the nascent RNA replacing ATP, leading to a duplex RNA which is structurally very similar to an unmodified one. We did not detect any reason to explain the inhibitory activity of Remdesivir at the active site. Displacement of the nascent Remdesivir-containing RNA duplex along the exit channel of the enzyme can occur without evident steric clashes which would justify delayed inhibition.

The major issue for controlling the infectious is lacking efficient prevention and therapeutic approaches. Chloroquine (CQ) and Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have been reported to treat the disease, but the underlying mechanism remains controversial.

PurposeThe objective of this study is to investigate whether CQ and HCQ could be ACE2 blockers and used to inhibit 2019-nCoV virus infection.

MethodsIn our study, we used CCK-8 staining, flow cytometry and immunofluorescent staining to evaluate the toxicity and autophagy of CQ and HCQ, respectively, on ACE2 high-expressing HEK293T cells (ACE2h cells). We further analyzed the binding character of CQ and HCQ to ACE2 by molecular docking and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays, 2019-nCoV spike pseudotyped virus was also used to observe the viropexis effect of CQ and HCQ in ACE2h cells.

ResultsResults showed that HCQ is slightly more toxic to ACE2h cells than CQ. Both CQ and HCQ could bind to ACE2 with KD =(7.31{+/-}0.62)e-7 M and (4.82{+/-}0.87)e-7 M, respectively. They exhibit equivalent suppression effect for the entrance of 2019-nCoV spike pseudotyped virus into ACE2h cells.

ConclusionsCQ and HCQ both inhibit the entrance 2019-nCoV into cells by blocking the binding of the virus with ACE2.

Here, we examined host response gene expression across infection status, viral load, age, and sex among shotgun RNA-sequencing profiles of nasopharyngeal swabs from 430 individuals with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 and 54 negative controls. SARS-CoV-2 induced a strong antiviral response with upregulation of antiviral factors such as OAS1-3 and IFIT1-3, and Th1 chemokines CXCL9/10/11, as well as a reduction in transcription of ribosomal proteins. SARS-CoV-2 culture in human airway epithelial cultures replicated the in vivo antiviral host response. Patient-matched longitudinal specimens (mean elapsed time = 6.3 days) demonstrated reduction in interferon-induced transcription, recovery of transcription of ribosomal proteins, and initiation of wound healing and humoral immune responses. Expression of interferon-responsive genes, including ACE2, increased as a function of viral load, while transcripts for B cell-specific proteins and neutrophil chemokines were elevated in patients with lower viral load. Older individuals had reduced expression of Th1 chemokines CXCL9/10/11 and their cognate receptor, CXCR3, as well as CD8A and granzyme B, suggesting deficiencies in trafficking and/or function of cytotoxic T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. Relative to females, males had reduced B and NK cell-specific transcripts and an increase in inhibitors of NF-{kappa}B signaling, possibly inappropriately throttling antiviral responses.

Since human viruses have codon usage biases that match highly expressed proteins in the tissues they infect and depend on host cell machinery for replication and co-evolution, we selected the genes that are highly expressed in the tissue of human lungs to perform computational studies that permit to compare their molecular features with SARS, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS genes.

For fruitful and rapid investigation of viral pathomechanisms, a collaborative and interdisciplinary approach is required. Therefore, we have developed ViralLink: a systems biology workflow which reconstructs and analyses networks representing the effect of viruses on intracellular signalling. These networks trace the flow of signal from intracellular viral proteins through their human binding proteins and downstream signalling pathways, ending with transcription factors regulating genes differentially expressed upon viral exposure. In this way, the workflow provides a mechanistic insight from previously identified knowledge of virally infected cells. By default, the workflow is set up to analyse the intracellular effects of SARS-CoV-2, requiring only transcriptomics counts data as input from the user: thus, encouraging and enabling rapid multidisciplinary research. However, the wide-ranging applicability and modularity of the workflow facilitates customisation of viral context, a priori interactions and analysis methods. Through a case study of SARS-CoV-2 infected bronchial/tracheal epithelial cells, we evidence the functionality of the workflow and its ability to identify key pathways and proteins in the cellular response to infection. The application of ViralLink to different viral infections in a cell-type specific manner using different available transcriptomics datasets will uncover key mechanisms in viral pathogenesis.

The N-glycan structure and composition of this glycoprotein influence how the virus interacts with host cells.Objective To identify a putative N-glycan biosynthesis pathway of SARS-CoV-2 (HEK293 cell recombinant) from previously published mass spectrometric studies, and to identify what effect blocking some enzymes has on the overall glycoprotein profile. Finally, our goal was to provide the biosynthesis network, and glycans in easy-to-use format for further glycoinformatics work.Methods We reconstructed the glycosylation network based on previously published empirical data using GNAT, a glycosylation network analysis tool. Our compilation of the network tool had 23 glycosyltransferase and glucosidase enzymes, and could infer the pathway of glycosylation machinery based on glycans identified in the virus spike protein. Once the glycan biosynthesis pathway was generated, we simulated the effect of blocking specific enzymes - Mannosidase-II and alpha-1,6-fucosyltransferase to see how they would affect the biosynthesis network.Results Of the 23 enzymes, a total of 12 were involved in glycosylation of SARS-CoV-2 - Man-Ia, MGAT1, MGAT2, MGAT4, MGAT5, B4GalT, B4GalT, Man II, SiaT, ST3GalI, ST3GalVI and FucT8. Blocking enzymes resulted in a substantially modified glycan profile of the protein.Conclusions A network analysis of N-glycan biosynthesis of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein shows an elaborate enzymatic pathway with several intermediate glycans, along with the ones identified by mass spectrometric studies.

SUMMARY ANSWERACE2 protein is highly expressed in human endometrial stromal cells during the secretory phase and is essential for human endometrial stromal cell decidualization.

WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADYACE2 is expressed in numerous human tissues including the lungs, heart, intestine, kidneys and placenta. ACE2 is also the receptor by which SARS-CoV-2 enters human cells.

STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATIONProliferative (n = 9) and secretory (n = 6) phase endometrium biopsies from healthy reproductive-age women and primary human endometrial stromal cells from proliferative phase endometrium were used in the study.

PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODSACE2 expression and localization were examined by qRT-PCR, Western blot, and immunofluorescence in both human endometrial samples and mouse uterine tissue. The effect of ACE2 knockdown on morphological and molecular changes of human endometrial stromal cell decidualization were assessed. Ovariectomized mice were treated with estrogen or progesterone to determine the effects of these hormones on ACE2 expression.

MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCEIn human tissue, ACE2 protein is expressed in both endometrial epithelial and stromal cells in the proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle, and expression increases in stromal cells in the secretory phase. The ACE2 mRNA (P < 0.0001) and protein abundance increased during primary human endometrial stromal cell (HESC) decidualization. HESCs transfected with ACE2-targeting siRNA were less able to decidualize than controls, as evidenced by a lack of morphology change and lower expression of the decidualization markers PRL and IGFBP1 (P < 0.05). In mice during pregnancy, ACE2 protein was expressed in uterine epithelial and stromal cells increased through day six of pregnancy. Finally, progesterone induced expression of Ace2 mRNA in mouse uteri more than vehicle or estrogen (P < 0.05).

LARGE SCALE DATAN/A.

LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTIONExperiments assessing the function of ACE2 in human endometrial stromal cell decidualization were in vitro. Whether SARS-CoV-2 can enter human endometrial stromal cells and affect decidualization have not been assessed.

WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGSExpression of ACE2 in the endometrium allow SARS-CoV-2 to enter endometrial epithelial and stromal cells, which could impair in vivo decidualization, embryo implantation, and placentation. If so, women with COVID-19 may be at increased risk of early pregnancy loss.

Currently, our knowledge of the mechanisms of COVID-19 disease pathogenesis is very limited which has hampered attempts to develop targeted antiviral strategies. Therefore, we urgently need an effective therapy for this unmet medical need. Viruses hijack and dysregulate cellular machineries in order for them to replicate and infect more cells. Thus, identifying and targeting dysregulated signaling pathways that have been taken over by viruses is one strategy for developing an effective antiviral therapy. We have developed a high-throughput drug screening system to identify potential antiviral drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2. We utilized a small molecule library of 430 protein kinase inhibitors, which are in various stages of clinical trials. Most of the tested kinase antagonists are ATP competitive inhibitors, a class of nucleoside analogs, which have been shown to have potent antiviral activity. From the primary screen, we have identified 34 compounds capable of inhibiting viral cytopathic effect in epithelial cells. Network of drug and protein relations showed that these compounds specifically targeted a limited number of cellular kinases. More importantly, we have identified mTOR-PI3K-AKT, ABL-BCR/MAPK, and DNA-Damage Response (DDR) pathways as key cellular signaling pathways critical for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Subsequently, a secondary screen confirmed compounds such as Berzosertib (VE-822), Vistusertib (AZD2014), and Nilotinib with anti SARS-CoV-2 activity. Finally, we found that Berzosertib, an ATR kinase inhibitor in the DDR pathway, demonstrated potent antiviral activity in a human epithelial cell line and human induced pluripotent stem cell (hIPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes. These inhibitors are already in clinical trials of phase 2 or 3 for cancer treatment, and can be repurposed as promising drug candidates for a host-directed therapy of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In conclusion, we have identified small molecule inhibitors exhibiting anti SARS-CoV-2 activity by blocking key cellular kinases, which gives insight on important mechanism of host-pathogen interaction. These compounds can be further evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19 patients following additional in vivo safety and efficacy studies.

Controlling the pandemic requires a multifaceted approach including whole genome sequencing to support public health interventions at local and national levels. One of the most widely used methods for sequencing is the ARTIC protocol, a tiling PCR approach followed by Oxford Nanopore sequencing (ONT) of up to 96 samples at a time. There is a need, however, for a flexible, platform agnostic, method that can provide multiple throughput options depending on changing requirements as the pandemic peaks and troughs. Here we present CoronaHiT, a method capable of multiplexing up to 96 small genomes on a single MinION flowcell or >384 genomes on Illumina NextSeq, using transposase mediated addition of adapters and PCR based addition of barcodes to ARTIC PCR products. We demonstrate the method by sequencing 95 and 59 SARS-CoV-2 genomes for routine and rapid outbreak response runs, respectively, on Nanopore and Illumina platforms and compare to the standard ARTIC LoCost nanopore method. Of the 154 samples sequenced using the three approaches, genomes with [&ge;] 90% coverage (GISAID criteria) were generated for 64.3% of samples for ARTIC LoCost, 71.4% for CoronaHiT-ONT, and 76.6% for CoronaHiT-Illumina and have almost identical clustering on a maximum likelihood tree. In conclusion, we demonstrate that CoronaHiT can multiplex up to 96 SARS-CoV-2 genomes per MinION flowcell and that Illumina sequencing can be performed on the same libraries, which will allow significantly higher throughput.

COVID-19 typically manifests as a respiratory illness but an increasing number of clinical reports describe gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. This is particularly true in children in whom GI symptoms are frequent and viral shedding outlasts viral clearance from the respiratory system. By contrast, fetuses seem to be rarely affected by COVID-19, although the virus has been detected in placentas of affected women. These observations raise the question of whether the virus can infect and replicate within the stomach once ingested. Moreover, it is not yet clear whether active replication of SARS-CoV-2 is possible in the stomach of children or in fetuses at different developmental stages. Here we show the novel derivation of fetal gastric organoids from 8-21 post-conception week (PCW) fetuses, and from pediatric biopsies, to be used as an in vitro model for SARS-CoV-2 gastric infection. Gastric organoids recapitulate human stomach with linear increase of gastric mucin 5AC along developmental stages, and expression of gastric markers pepsinogen, somatostatin, gastrin and chromogranin A. In order to investigate SARS-CoV-2 infection with minimal perturbation and under steady-state conditions, we induced a reversed polarity in the gastric organoids (RP-GOs) in suspension. In this condition of exposed apical polarity, the virus can easily access viral receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The pediatric RP-GOs are fully susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2, where viral nucleoprotein is expressed in cells undergoing programmed cell death, while the efficiency of infection is significantly lower in fetal organoids. The RP-GOs derived from pediatric patients show sustained robust viral replication of SARS-CoV-2, compared with organoids derived from fetal stomachs. Transcriptomic analysis shows a moderate innate antiviral response and the lack of differentially expressed genes belonging to the interferon family. Collectively, we established the first expandable human gastric organoid culture across fetal developmental stages, and we support the hypothesis that fetal tissue seems to be less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially in early stages of development. However, the virus can efficiently infect gastric epithelium in pediatric patients, suggesting that the stomach might have an active role in fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2.",1,504,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.24.167049v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.24.167049v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2020.06.24.167049.txt,1,data availability statement,0,deposited data (gastric rna-seq data: gse_xxxx it will be deposited during revision) or from the authors upon reasonable request.  15   biorxiv preprint doi,NA

In human studies, CT prevented colds in healthy subjects and enhanced antibody production after influenza vaccination in elderly individuals with a poor nutritional status. The mechanism of action of CT is thought to be glutathione (GSH)-mediated regulation of intracellular redox, which might affect innate immune systems such as macrophages to exert physiological effects. The effect of CT on influenza is independent of viral type, and this treatment has a broad range of antiviral activities. To explore the mechanisms of CT in viral infection, we performed transcriptome profiling of spleen tissues isolated from influenza A virus (IAV)-infected mice. We identified unique gene signatures in response to CT in the IAV-infected mice. Genes upregulated by CT included redox-regulated genes such as GCLC/GCLM (subunits of glutamate cysteine ligase, a rate-limiting enzyme of GSH biosynthesis), TXN1, TXN2, TXNRD2, and SOD1, suggesting that the intracellular redox environment is substantially altered by CT. However, genes downregulated in response to CT included chemokine/chemokine receptor genes (CCL5, CCL19, CXCL9, CXCL12, CXCR3, CXCR4, and ACKR3), some of which are related to cytokine storm. A comparison with public COVID-19-related gene set data showed that the upregulated gene signature was highly similar to the downregulated gene sets of SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2-infected cells and the upregulated gene set of attenuated SARS-CoV-infected cells.

Four structural proteins, envelope (E), membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S) glycoprotein, play a key role in controlling the entry into human cells and virion assembly of SARS-CoV-2. However, how these genes evolve during its human to human transmission is largely unknown. In this study, we screened and analyzed roughly 3090 SARS-CoV-2 isolates from GenBank database. The distribution of the four gene alleles is determined:16 for E, 40 for M, 131 for N and 173 for S genes. Phylogenetic analysis shows that global SARS-CoV-2 isolates can be clustered into three to four major clades based on the protein sequences of these genes. Intragenic recombination event isnt detected among different alleles. However, purifying selection has conducted on the evolution of these genes. By analyzing full genomic sequences of these alleles using codon-substitution models (M8, M3 and M2a) and likelihood ratio tests (LRTs) of codeML package, it reveals that codon 614 of S glycoprotein has subjected to strong positive selection pressure and a persistent D614G mutation is identified. The definitive positive selection of D614G mutation is further confirmed by internal fixed effects likelihood (IFEL) and Evolutionary Fingerprinting methods implemented in Hyphy package. In addition, another potential positive selection site at codon 5 in the signal sequence of the S protein is also identified. The allele containing D614G mutation has undergone significant expansion during SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic, implying a better adaptability of isolates with the mutation. However, L5F allele expansion is relatively restricted. The D614G mutation is located at the subdomain 2 (SD2) of C-terminal portion (CTP) of the S1 subunit. Protein structural modeling shows that the D614G mutation may cause the disruption of salt bridge among S protein monomers increase their flexibility, and in turn promote receptor binding domain (RBD) opening, virus attachment and entry into host cells. Located at the signal sequence of S protein as it is, L5F mutation may facilitate the protein folding, assembly, and secretion of the virus. This is the first evidence of positive Darwinian selection in the spike gene of SARS-CoV-2, which contributes to a better understanding of the adaptive mechanism of this virus and help to provide insights for developing novel therapeutic approaches as well as effective vaccines by targeting on mutation sites.",1,111,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.25.170688v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.25.170688v2.full.pdf,_10.1101_2020.06.25.170688.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Thus here we collected 2,142 high-quality genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from 160 regions in over 50 countries and reconstructed their phylogeny, and also analyzed the interaction between the polymorphisms of spike protein and human ACE2 (hACE2). Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 and coronavirus in other hosts show SARS-CoV-2 is highly possible originated from Bat-CoV (RaTG13) found in horseshoe bat and a recombination event may occur on the spike protein of Pangolin-CoV to imbue it the ability to infect humans. Moreover, compared to the S gene of SARS-CoV-2, it is more conserved in the direct-binding sites of RBD and we noticed that spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 may under a consensus evolution to adapt to human hosts better. 3,860 amino acid mutations in spike protein RBD (T333-C525) of SARS-CoV-2 were simulated and their stability and affinity binding to hACE2 (S19-D615) were calculated.

While the Nextstrain and GISAID portals offer widely used systems for the classification of SARS-CoV-2 genomes, both present relevant limitations. Here we propose a highly reproducible method for the systematic classification of SARS-CoV-2 viral types. To demonstrate the validity of our approach, we conduct an extensive comparative genomic analysis of more than 20,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Our classification system delineates 12 clusters and 4 super-clusters in SARS-CoV-2, with a highly biased spatio-temporal distribution worldwide, and provides important observations concerning the evolutionary processes associated with the emergence of novel viral types. Based on the estimates of SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary rate and genetic distances of genomes of the early pandemic phase, we infer that SARS-CoV-2 could have been circulating in humans since August-November 2019. The observed pattern of genomic variability is remarkably similar between all clusters and super-clusters, being UTRs and the s2m element, a highly conserved secondary structure element, the most variable genomic regions. While several polymorphic sites that are specific to one or more clusters were predicted to be under positive or negative selection, overall, our analyses also suggest that the emergence of novel genome types is unlikely to be driven by widespread convergent evolution and independent fixation of advantageous substitutions. While, in the absence of rigorous experimental validation, several questions concerning the evolutionary processes and the phenotypic characteristics (increased/decreased virulence) remain open, we believe that the approach outlined in this study can be of relevance for the tracking and functional characterization of different types of SARS-CoV-2 genomes.",1,156,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.26.172924v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.26.172924v2.full.pdf,_10.1101_2020.06.26.172924.txt,0,NA,1,NA,the software for the operational classification of sars-cov-2 lineages proposed here is publicly  available  through  this  github  repository  https://github.com/matteo14c/assign_cl_sars-cov-2​.;     to facilitate the classification of newly sequenced sars-cov-2 genomes an automated software package that implements the criteria devised in the present study has is made publicly available at ​https://github.com/matteo14c/assign_cl_sars-cov-2​ .

We found that both overweight and undernutrition downregulate the levels of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) without influence on the levels of ACE1 in kidney rats. Administration of Ang-(3–4) recovers the control levels of ACE2 in overweight but not in undernourished rats.

MethodsAssessment of the two assays was performed prospectively in three reference Parisians hospitals, using 170 clinical samples. They were tested with the Cobas(R) assay, selected to obtain a distribution of cycle threshold (Ct) as large as possible, and tested with the RealStar assay with three largely available extraction platforms: QIAsymphony (Qiagen), MagNAPure (Roche) and NucliSENS-easyMag (BioMerieux).

ResultsOverall, the agreement (positive for at least one gene) was 76%. This rate differed considerably depending on the Cobas Ct values for gene E: below 35 (n = 91), the concordance was 99%. Regarding the positive Ct values, linear regression analysis showed a determination correlation (R2) of 0.88 and the Deming regression line revealed a strong correlation with a slope of 1.023 and an intercept of -3.9.

Due to lack of specific medicine and vaccine, viral infection has gained a frightening rate and created a devastating state across the globe. Here the authors have attempted to design epitope based potential peptide as a vaccine candidate using immunoinformatics approach. As of evidence from literatures, SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein is a key protein to initiate the viral infection within a host cell thus used here as a reasonable vaccine target. We have predicted a 9-mer peptide as representative of both B-cell and T-cell epitopic region along with suitable properties such as antigenic and non-allergenic. To its support, strong molecular interaction of the predicted peptide was also observed with MHC molecules and Toll Like receptors. The present study may helpful to step forward in the development of vaccine candidates against COVID-19.

An antisense gene in HIV-1 (Hap) induces apoptosis in human cells. Apoptotic T cell death following HIV-1 infection leads to a compromised immune system and eventually AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). A review of several studies that focused on long-term survivors of HIV-1 reveals that these survivors had deletion-mutations in Hap. A subset of these survivors changed course and experienced CD4+ T cell death and progression to AIDS. These individuals had virus that regained Hap gene sequence that had previously been deleted. Analysis of the changes in the genetic sequences with in vivo progression of the revertant HIV-1 virus allowed identification of a specific region in Hap we are calling MORT. MORT, in Hap RNA forms a primary microRNA-like structure. Potential human mRNAs targeted by MORT mi/siRNAs include gene/RNA sequences of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP), survivin, and apollon, along with many other human gene sites/RNAs. Thus MORT may be acting as an RNA antagonist to cellular IAPs thereby inducing apoptotic cell death.

However, there is limited published data associating the results from commercial assays with neutralizing antibodies.Methods 67 specimens from 48 patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 and a positive result by the Roche Elecsys SARS-CoV-2, Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG, or EUROIMMUN SARS-CoV-2 IgG assays and 5 control specimens were analyzed for the presence of neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Correlation, concordance, positive percent agreement (PPA), and negative percent agreement (NPA) were calculated at several cutoffs. Results were compared in patients categorized by clinical outcomes.Results The correlation between SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titer (EC50) and the Roche, Abbott, and EUROIMMUN assays was 0.29, 0.47, and 0.46 respectively. At an EC50 of 1:32, the concordance kappa with Roche was 0.49 (95% CI; 0.23-0.75), with Abbott was 0.52 (0.28-0.77), and with EUROIMMUN was 0.61 (0.4-0.82). At the same neutralizing titer, the PPA and NPA for the Roche was 100% (94-100) &amp; 56% (30-80); Abbott was 96% (88-99) &amp; 69% (44-86); and EUROIMMUN was 91% (80-96) &amp; 81% (57-93) for distinguishing neutralizing antibodies. Patients who died, were intubated, or had a cardiac injury from COVID-19 infection had significantly higher neutralizing titers relative to those with mild symptoms.Conclusion COVID-19 patients generate an antibody response to multiple viral proteins such that the calibrator ratios on the Roche, Abbott, and EUROIMMUN assays are all associated with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. Nevertheless, commercial serological assays have poor NPA for SARS-CoV-2 neutralization, making them imperfect proxies for neutralization.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",1,590,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.01.182220v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.01.182220v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2020.07.01.182220.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Our ability to study the SARS-COV-2 virus and its interactions with its human host in molecular terms efficiently and collaboratively becomes indispensable and mission-critical in the race to develop vaccines, drugs, and neutralizing antibodies. There is already a significant corpus of 3D structures related to SARS and MERS coronaviruses, and the rapid generation of new structures demands the use of efficient tools to expedite the sharing of structural analyses and molecular designs and convey them in their native 3D context in sync with sequence data and annotations. We developed iCn3D (pronounced “I see in 3D”) 1 to take full advantage of web technologies and allow scientists of different backgrounds to perform and share sequence-structure analyses over the Internet and engage in collaborations through a simple mechanism of exchanging “lifelong” web links (URLs). This approach solves the very old problem of “sharing of molecular scenes” in a reliable and convenient manner. iCn3D links are sharable over the Internet and make data and entire analyses findable, accessible, and reproducible, with various levels of interoperability. Links and underlying data are FAIR 2 and can be embedded in preprints and papers, bringing a 3D live and interactive dimension to a world of text and static images used in current publications, eliminating at the same time the need for arcane supplemental materials.

We aimed to identify and characterize genes that are co-expressed with ACE2 and TMPRSS2, and to further explore their biological functions and potential as druggable targets.METHODS Using the gene expression profiles of 1,038 lung tissue samples, we performed a weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) to identify modules of co-expressed genes. We explored the biology of co-expressed genes using bioinformatics databases, and identified known drug-gene interactions.RESULTS ACE2 was in a module of 681 co-expressed genes; 12 genes with moderate-high correlation with ACE2 (r&gt;0.3, FDR&lt;0.05) had known interactions with existing drug compounds. TMPRSS2 was in a module of 1,086 co-expressed genes; 15 of these genes were enriched in the gene ontology biologic process ‘Entry into host cell’, and 53 TMPRSS2-correlated genes had known interactions with drug compounds.CONCLUSION Dozens of genes are co-expressed with ACE2 and TMPRSS2, many of which have plausible links to COVID-19 pathophysiology. Many of the co-expressed genes are potentially targetable with existing drugs, which may help to fast-track the development of COVID-19 therapeutics.Competing Interest StatementS.M. reports personal fees from Novartis and Boehringer-Ingelheim, outside the submitted work.

In addition to the acute pulmonary symptoms of COVID-19 (the disease associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection), pulmonary and distal coagulopathies have caused morbidity and mortality in many patients. Currently, the molecular pathogenesis underlying COVID-19 associated coagulopathies are unknown. While there are many theories for the cause of this pathology, including hyper inflammation and excess tissue damage, the cellular and molecular underpinnings are not yet clear. By analyzing transcriptomic data sets from experimental and clinical research teams, we determined that changes in the gene expression of genes important in the extrinsic coagulation cascade in the lung epithelium may be important triggers for COVID-19 coagulopathy. This regulation of the extrinsic blood coagulation cascade is not seen with influenza A virus (IAV)-infected NHBEs suggesting that the lung epithelial derived coagulopathies are specific to SARS-Cov-2 infection. This study is the first to identify potential lung epithelial cell derived factors contributing to COVID-19 associated coagulopathy.

C_LIO_LICurrently, the molecular pathogenesis underlying COVID-19 associated coagulopathies are unknown. Understanding the molecular basis of dysregulated blood coagulation during SARS-CoV-2 infection may help promote new therapeutic strategies to mitigate these complications in COVID-19 patients.
C_LI

What did the researchers do and find?O_LIWe analyzed three publicly available RNA sequencing datasets to identify possible molecular etiologies of COVID-19 associated coagulopathies. These data sets include sequencing libraries from clinically isolated samples of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and healthy controls. We also analyzed a publicly available RNA sequencing dataset derived from in vitro SARS-CoV-2 infected primary normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells and mock infected samples.
C_LIO_LIPathway analysis of both NHBE and BALF differential gene expression gene sets. We found that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces the activation of the extrinsic blood coagulation cascade and suppression of the plasminogen activation system in both NHBEs and cells isolated from the BALF. PBMCs did not differentially express genes regulating blood coagulation.
C_LIO_LIComparison with influenza A virus (IAV)-infected NHBEs revealed that the regulation of the extrinsic blood coagulation cascade is unique to SARS-CoV-2, and not seen with IAV infection.
C_LI

What do these findings mean?O_LIThe hyper-activation of the extrinsic blood coagulation cascade and the suppression of the plasminogen activation system in SARS-CoV-2 infected epithelial cells may drive diverse coagulopathies in the lung and distal organ systems.
C_LIO_LIThe gene transcription pattern in SARS-CoV-2 infected epithelial cells is distinct from IAV infected epithelial cells with regards to the regulation of blood coagulation.

Any return to normalcy requires rapid development of countermeasures, with animal models serving as a critical tool in testing vaccines and therapeutics. Animal disease status and potential COVID-19 exposure prior to study execution may severely bias efficacy testing. We developed a toolbox of immunological and molecular tests to monitor countermeasure impact on disease outcome and evaluate pre-challenge COVID-19 status. Assay application showed critical necessity for animal pre-screening. Specifically, real-time PCR results documented pre-exposure of an African Green Monkey prior to SARS-CoV-2 challenge with sequence confirmation as a community-acquired exposure. Longitudinal monitoring of nasopharyngeal swabs and serum showed pre-exposure impacted both viral disease course and resulting immunological response. This study demonstrates utility in a comprehensive pre-screening strategy for animal models, which captured the first documented case of community-acquired, non-human primate infection.

Among the extensive and crucial research that has been carried out in the last few months, the analysis of the virus-host relationship plays an important role in drug discovery. Virus-host protein-protein interactions are the active agents in virus replication, and the analysis of virus-host protein-protein interaction networks is fundamental to the study of the virus-host relationship. We have adapted and implemented a recent integer linear programming model for protein-protein interaction network alignment to virus-host networks, and obtained a consensus alignment of the SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 virus-host protein-protein interaction networks. Despite the lack of shared human proteins in these virus-host networks and the low number of preserved virus-host interactions, the consensus alignment revealed aligned human proteins that share a function related to viral infection, as well as human proteins of high functional similarity that interact with SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 proteins, whose alignment would preserve these virus-host interactions.View Full Text",1,402,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.07.191247v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.07.191247v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2020.07.07.191247.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

To control emerging viruses, existing successful anti(retro)viral therapies can inspire antiviral strategies, as conserved viral enzymes (eg., viral proteases and RNA-dependent RNA polymerases) represent targets of choice. Since 2003, much effort has been expended in the characterization of the SARS-CoV replication/transcription machinery. Until recently, a pure and highly active preparation of SARS-CoV recombinant RNA synthesis machinery was not available, impeding target-based high throughput screening of drug candidates against this viral family. The current Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic revealed a new pathogen whose RNA synthesis machinery is highly (>96% aa identity) homologous to SARS-CoV. This phylogenetic relatedness highlights the potential use of conserved replication enzymes to discover inhibitors against this significant pathogen, which in turn, contributes to scientific preparedness against emerging viruses. Here, we report the use of a purified and highly active SARS-CoV replication/transcription complex (RTC) to set-up a high-throughput screening of Coronavirus RNA synthesis inhibitors. The screening of a small (1,520 compounds) chemical library of FDA-approved drugs demonstrates the robustness of our assay and will allow to speed-up drug repositioning or novel drug discovery against the SARS-CoV-2.

Once inhaled, SARS-CoV-2 particles gain entry into respiratory ciliated cells by interacting with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). It is known that ACE2 functions within the renin-angiotensin system to regulate blood pressure, fluid homeostasis and inflammation. However, it is largely unknown what roles ACE2 has in ciliated cells of the airway. Therefore, understanding the function and nature of ACE2 within airway tissue has become an essential element in combatting the COVID-19 pandemic. Airway mucociliary tissue was generated in-vitro using primary human nasal epithelial cells isolated from nasal turbinates of donors and the air-liquid interface (ALI) model of differentiation. Using ALI tissue we cloned transcripts for three distinct variants of ACE2, one of which encodes the full-length ACE2 protein, the other two transcripts are truncated isoforms that had only been predicted to exist via sequence analysis software. We demonstrate that all three isoforms have the capacity to be glycosylated, a known modification of full-length ACE2. Immunofluorescence microscopy of individual ACE2 isoform transfected cells reveals distinct localization of variant 1 relative to X1 and X2. Double staining immunohistochemistry of ALI tissue using antibodies to either the N-term or C-term region of ACE2 revealed distinct and overlapping signals in the apical cytosol of ciliated cells. Most notably only the ACE2 C-term antibody displayed plasma-membrane localization in ciliated cells. We also observed a decrease in the total amount of ACE2 in ALI tissue derived from a 33 year-old male donor when compared to a 34 year-old female donor, thus there may be variation in the abundance of ACE2 protein in the airway among the population. Together, our data begins to highlight the dynamic status of the ACE2 protein in airway mucociliary tissue and we propose multiple ACE2 parameters that may impact an individuals susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. These parameters include the balance of cytosolic versus membrane bound ACE2, isoform expression levels, maintenance of post-translational modifications and the impact of genetic, environmental and lifestyle factors on these processes.",1,70,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.190074v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.190074v2.full.pdf,_10.1101_2020.07.09.190074.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Methods and findingsWe explored the SARS-CoV-2 contamination of environmental surfaces and air by collecting air and swabbing environmental surfaces among 39 COVID-19 cases in Guangzhou, China. The specimens were tested by RT-PCR testing. The information collected for COVID-19 cases included basic demographic, clinical severity, onset of symptoms, radiological testing, laboratory testing and hospital admission. A total of 641 environmental surfaces and air specimens were collected among 39 COVID-19 cases before disinfection. Among them, 20 specimens (20/641, 3.1%) were tested positive from 9 COVID-19 cases (9/39, 23.1%), with 5 (5/101, 5.0%) positive specimens from 3 asymptomatic cases, 5 (5/220, 2.3%) from 3 mild cases, and 10 (10/374, 2.7%) from 3 moderate cases. All positive specimens were collected within 3 days after diagnosis, and 10 (10/42, 23.8%) were found in toilet (5 on toilet bowl, 4 on sink/faucet/shower, 1 on floor drain), 4 (4/21, 19.0%) in anteroom (2 on water dispenser/cup/bottle, 1 on chair/table, 1 on TV remote), 1 (1/8, 12.5%) in kitchen (1 on dining-table), 1 (1/18, 5.6%) in bedroom (1 on bed/sheet pillow/bedside table), 1 (1/5, 20.0%) in car (1 on steering wheel/seat/handlebar) and 3 (3/20, 21.4%) on door knobs. Air specimens in room (0/10, 0.0%) and car (0/1, 0.0%) were all negative.

ConclusionsSARS-CoV-2 was found on environmental surfaces especially in toilet, and could survive for several days.

The gravity of the situation mandates accelerated efforts to identify safe and effective vaccines. Here, we generated measles virus (MeV)-based vaccine candidates expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S). Insertion of the full-length S protein gene in two different MeV genomic positions resulted in modulated S protein expression. The variant with lower S protein expression levels was genetically stable and induced high levels of effective Th1-biased antibody and T cell responses in mice after two immunizations. In addition to neutralizing IgG antibody responses in a protective range, multifunctional CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses with S protein-specific killing activity were detected. These results are highly encouraging and support further development of MeV-based COVID-19 vaccines.

Significance StatementThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused hundreds of thousands of deaths, yet. Therefore, effective vaccine concepts are urgently needed. In search for such a concept, we have analysed a measles virus-based vaccine candidate targeting SARS-CoV-2. Using this well known, safe vaccine backbone, we demonstrate here induction of functional immune responses in both arms of adaptive immunity with the desired immune bias. Therefore, occurrence of immunopathologies such as antibody-dependent enhancement or enhanced respiratory disease is rather unlikely. Moreover, the candidate still induces immunity against the measles, recognized as a looming second menace, when countries are entrapped to stop routine vaccination campaigns in the face of COVID-19. Thus, a bivalent measles-based COVID-19 vaccine could be the solution for two significant public health threats.",1,302,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.11.198291v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.11.198291v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2020.07.11.198291.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

However, there is scarce data relating COVID-19 risks and outcome with cigarette or e-cig use. In this study, we mined 3 independent RNA expression datasets from smokers and vapers to understand the potential relationship between vaping/smoking and the dysregulation of key genes and pathways related to COVID-19. We found that smoking, but not vaping, upregulates ACE2, the cellular receptor that SARS-CoV-2 requires for infection. Both smoking and use of nicotine and flavor-containing e-cig led to upregulations of pro-inflammatory cytokine production and expression of genes related to inflammasomes. Vaping flavor-less and nicotine-less e-cig, however, did not lead to significant cytokine dysregulation and inflammasome activation. Release of inflammasome products, such as IL-1B, and cytokine storms are hallmarks of COVID-19 infection, especially in severe cases. Therefore, our findings demonstrated that smoking or vaping, specifically use of flavored or nicotine-containing e-cigs, may critically exacerbate COVID-19-related inflammation or increase susceptibility to the disease.

Among the most urgent tasks is obtaining a detailed understanding of the molecular interactions that facilitate viral replication or contribute to host defense mechanisms in infected cells. While SARS-CoV-2 co-opts cellular factors for viral translation and genome replication, a comprehensive map of the host cell proteome in direct contact with viral RNA has not been elucidated. Here, we use RNA antisense purification and mass spectrometry (RAP-MS) to obtain an unbiased and quantitative picture of the human proteome that directly binds the SARS-CoV-2 RNA in infected human cells. We discover known host factors required for coronavirus replication, regulators of RNA metabolism and host defense pathways, along with dozens of potential drug targets among direct SARS-CoV-2 binders. We further integrate the SARS-CoV-2 RNA interactome with proteome dynamics induced by viral infection, linking interactome proteins to the emerging biology of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Validating RAP-MS, we show that CNBP, a regulator of proinflammatory cytokines, directly engages the SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Supporting the functional relevance of identified interactors, we show that the interferon-induced protein RYDEN suppresses SARS-CoV-2 ribosomal frameshifting and demonstrate that inhibition of SARS-CoV-2-bound proteins is sufficient to manipulate viral replication.

In this report, we develop a robust in vitro nonradioactive primer extension assay to evaluate the incorporation efficiency of nucleotide analog by SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) quantitively. Our results show that many nucleotide analogs can be incorporated into RNA by SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, and that the incorporation of some of them leads to chain termination. The discrimination values of nucleotide analog over those of natural nucleotide were measured to evaluate the incorporation efficiency of nucleotide analog by RdRp. We found that the incorporation efficiency of Remdesivir-TP is higher than ATP, and we did not observe chain termination or delayed chain termination caused by single Remdesivir-TP incorporation, while multiple incorporations of Remdesivir-TP caused chain termination in our assay condition. The incorporation efficiency of Ribavirin-TP and Favipiravir-TP is very low either as ATP or GTP analogs, which suggested that mutagenesis may not be the mechanism of action of those two drugs against SARS-CoV-2. Incorporation of Sofosbuvir-TP is also very low suggesting that sofosbuvir may not be very effective in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection. As a comparison, 2-C-Methyl-GTP can be incorporated into RNA efficiently, and the derivative of 2-C-Methyl-GTP may have therapeutic application in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The presence of antibodies to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in convalescent donors was established at the first donation. Seropositive donors were asked to donate additional plasma units every six days. Until now, 15 donors have donated at least four times and, in some cases, up to nine times.

In all donors, the level of antibodies remained relatively stable up to about 76 days after symptoms onset but then started to decrease more rapidly to reach, in some convalescent donors, a seronegative status within 100-110 days after symptoms onset. The decline in anti-RBD antibodies was not related to the number of donations but strongly correlated with the numbers of days after symptoms onset (r = 0.821).

However, the readout from the chemical modulation of a single protein is poorly correlated with phenotypic response of organism, leading to high failure rate in drug development. Chemical-induced gene expression profile provides an attractive solution to phenotype-based screening. However, the use of such data is currently limited by their sparseness, unreliability, and relatively low throughput. Several methods have been proposed to impute missing values for gene expression datasets. However, few existing methods can perform de novo chemical compound screening. In this study, we propose a mechanism-driven neural network-based method named DeepCE (Deep Chemical Expression) which utilizes graph convolutional neural network to learn chemical representation and multi-head attention mechanism to model chemical substructure-gene and gene-gene feature associations. In addition, we propose a novel data augmentation method which extracts useful information from unreliable experiments in L1000 dataset. The experimental results show that DeepCE achieves the superior performances not only in de novo chemical setting but also in traditional imputation setting compared to state-of-the-art baselines for the prediction of chemical-induced gene expression. We further verify the effectiveness of gene expression profiles generated from DeepCE by comparing them with gene expression profiles in L1000 dataset for downstream classification tasks including drug-target and disease predictions. To demonstrate the value of DeepCE, we apply it to patient-specific drug repurposing of COVID-19 for the first time, and generate novel lead compounds consistent with clinical evidences.

The stronger hACE2 affinity of SARS-CoV-2 has been connected with its higher infectivity. In this work, we study hACE2 complexes with the receptor binding domains (RBDs) of the human SARS-CoV-2 and human SARS-CoV viruses, using all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and Computational Protein Design (CPD) with a physics-based energy function. The MD simulations identify charge-modifying substitutions between the CoV-2 and CoV RBDs, which either increase or decrease the hACE2 affinity of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. The combined effect of these mutations is small, and the relative affinity is mainly determined by substitutions at residues in contact with hACE2. Many of these findings are in line and interpret recent experiments. Our CPD calculations redesign positions 455, 493, 494 and 501 of the SARS-CoV-2 RBM, which contact hACE2 in the complex and are important for ACE2 recognition. Sampling is enhanced by an adaptive importance sampling Monte Carlo method. Sequences with increased affinity replace CoV-2 glutamine by a negative residue at position 493, and serine by nonpolar, aromatic or a threonine at position 494. Substitutions at positions positions 455 and 501 have a smaller effect on affinity. Substitutions suggested by our design are seen in viral sequences encountered in other species, including bat and pangolin. Our results might be used to identify potential virus strains with higher human infectivity and assist in the design of peptide-based or peptidomimetic compounds with the potential to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 binding at hACE2.

SIGNIFICANCEThe coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the current COVID-19 pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 and the earlier, closely related SARS-CoV virus bind at the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor at the cell surface. The higher human infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 may be linked to its stronger affinity for hACE2. Here, we study by computational methods complexes of hACE2 with the receptor binding domains (RBDs) of viruses SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. We identify residues affecting the affinities of the two domains for hACE2. We also propose mutations at key SARS-CoV-2 positions, which might enhance hACE2 affinity. Such mutations may appear in viral strains with increased human infectivity and might assist the design of peptide-based compounds that inhibit infection of human cells by SARS-CoV-2.",1,235,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.20.212068v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.20.212068v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2020.07.20.212068.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

In the majority of infected patients, SARS-CoV-2 leads to mild disease; however, in a significant proportion of infections, individuals develop severe symptoms that can lead to permanent lung damage or death. These severe cases are often associated with high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and low antiviral responses which can lead to systemic complications. We have evaluated transcriptional and cytokine secretion profiles from infected cell cultures and detected a distinct upregulation of inflammatory cytokines that parallels samples taken from infected patients. Building on these observations, we found a specific activation of NF-{kappa}B and a block of IRF3 nuclear translocation in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. This NF-{kappa}B response is mediated by cGAS-STING activation and could be attenuated through STING targeting drugs. Our results show that SARS-CoV-2 curates a cGAS-STING mediated NF-{kappa}B driven inflammatory immune response in epithelial cells that likely contributes to inflammatory responses seen in patients and might be a target to suppress severe disease symptoms.",1,228,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.21.212639v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.21.212639v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2020.07.21.212639.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

The aim of this study was to perform a comprehensive evolutionary analysis to describe the human outbreak and the evolutionary rate of different genomic regions of SARS-CoV-2.

The molecular evolution in nine genomic regions of SARS-CoV-2 was analyzed using three different approaches: phylogenetic signal assessment, emergence of amino acid substitutions, and Bayesian evolutionary rate estimation in eight successive fortnights since the virus emergence.

All observed phylogenetic signals were very low and trees topologies were in agreement with those signals. However, after four months of evolution, it was possible to identify regions revealing an incipient viral lineages formation despite the low phylogenetic signal, since fortnight 3. Finally, the SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary rate for regions nsp3 and S, the ones presenting greater variability, was estimated to values of 1.37 x 10-3 and 2.19 x 10-3 substitution/site/year, respectively.

In conclusion, results obtained in this work about the variable diversity of crucial viral regions and the determination of the evolutionary rate are consequently decisive to understand essential feature of viral emergence.

Systemic vaccination by this vector in mice, in which the expression of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor hACE2 has been induced by transduction of respiratory tract cells by an adenoviral vector, conferred only partial protection, despite an intense serum neutralizing activity. However, targeting the immune response to the respiratory tract through an intranasal boost with this LV resulted in > 3 log10 decrease in the lung viral loads and avoided local inflammation. Moreover, both integrative and non-integrative LV platforms displayed a strong vaccine efficacy and inhibited lung deleterious injury in golden hamsters, which are naturally permissive to SARS-CoV-2 replication and restitute the human COVID-19 physiopathology.

We found that the dengue incidence declined significantly with a greater magnitude at phase 1 of lockdown, with a negative gradient of 3.2-fold steeper than the trend observed in previous years and 6.5-fold steeper than the simulation, indicating that the control of population movement did reduce dengue transmission. However, starting from phase 2 of lockdown, the dengue incidences demonstrated an elevation and earlier rebound by at least 4 weeks and grew with an exponential pattern compared to the simulation and previous years. Together with our data on Aedes mosquitoes from a district of Penang, Malaysia, we revealed that Aedes albopictus is the predominant species for both indoor and outdoor environments. The abundance of the mosquito was increasing steadily during the period of lockdown, and demonstrated strong correlation with the locally reported dengue incidences; therefore, we proposed the possible diffusive effect of vector that led to a higher acceleration of incidence rate.

Viruses can also spread through fusion of infected with uninfected cells. We compared the requirements of ACE2 expression, proteolytic activation, and the sensitivity to inhibitors for SARS2-S-mediated and SARS-CoV-S(SARS1-S)-mediated cell-cell fusion. SARS2-S-driven fusion was moderately increased by TMPRSS2 and strongly by ACE2, while SARS1-S-driven fusion was strongly increased by TMPRSS2 and less so by ACE2 expression. In contrast to SARS1-S, SARS2-S-mediated cell-cell fusion was efficiently activated by Batimastat-sensitive metalloproteases. Mutation of the S1/S2 proteolytic cleavage site reduced effector-target-cell fusion when ACE2 or TMPRSS2 were limiting and rendered SARS2-S-driven cell-cell fusion more dependent on TMPRSS2. When both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were abundant, initial target-effector-cell fusion was unaltered compared to wt SARS2-S, but syncytia remained smaller. Mutation of the S2 site specifically abrogated activation by TMPRSS2 for both cell-cell fusion and SARS2-S-driven pseudoparticle entry but still allowed for activation by metalloproteases for cell-cell fusion and by cathepsins for particle entry. Finally, we found that the TMPRSS2 inhibitor Bromhexine was unable to reduce TMPRSS2-activated cell-cell fusion by SARS1-S and SARS2-S as opposed to the inhibitor Camostat. Paradoxically, Bromhexine enhanced cell-cell fusion in the presence of TMPRSS2, while its metabolite Ambroxol exhibited inhibitory activity in some conditions. On Calu-3 lung cells, Ambroxol weakly inhibited SARS2-S-driven lentiviral pseudoparticle entry, and both substances exhibited a dose-dependent trend towards weak inhibition of authentic SARS-CoV-2.

IMPORTANCECell-cell fusion allows the virus to infect neighboring cells without the need to produce free virus and contributes to tissue damage by creating virus-infected syncytia. Our results demonstrate that the S2 cleavage site is essential for activation by TMPRSS2 and unravel important differences between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, among those greater dependence of SARS-CoV-2 on ACE2 expression and activation by metalloproteases for cell-cell fusion. Bromhexine, reportedly an inhibitor of TMPRSS2, is currently tested in clinical trials against coronavirus disease 2019. Our results indicate that Bromhexine enhances fusion in some conditions. We therefore caution against use of Bromhexine in higher dosage until its effects on SARS-CoV-2 spike activation are better understood. The related compound Ambroxol, which similarly to Bromhexine is clinically used as an expectorant, did not exhibit activating effects on cell-cell fusion. Both compounds exhibited weak inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 infection at high concentrations, which might be clinically attainable for Ambroxol.",1,17,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.25.221135v4?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.25.221135v4.full.pdf,_10.1101_2020.07.25.221135.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Investigations of these localized pathologies have been hindered by a lack of 3D in vitro human distal lung culture systems. Further, human distal lung stem cell identification has been impaired by quiescence, anatomic divergence from mouse and lack of lineage tracing and clonogenic culture. Here, we developed robust feeder-free, chemically-defined culture of distal human lung progenitors as organoids derived clonally from single adult human alveolar epithelial type II (AT2) or KRT5+ basal cells. AT2 organoids exhibited AT1 transdifferentiation potential, while basal cell organoids progressively developed lumens lined by differentiated club and ciliated cells. Organoids consisting solely of club cells were not observed. Upon single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), alveolar organoids were composed of proliferative AT2 cells; however, basal organoid KRT5+ cells contained a distinct ITGA6+ITGB4+ mitotic population whose proliferation segregated to a TNFRSF12Ahi subfraction. Clonogenic organoid growth was markedly enriched within the TNFRSF12Ahi subset of FACS-purified ITGA6+ITGB4+ basal cells from human lung or derivative organoids. In vivo, TNFRSF12A+ cells comprised ~10% of KRT5+ basal cells and resided in clusters within terminal bronchioles. To model COVID-19 distal lung disease, we everted the polarity of basal and alveolar organoids to rapidly relocate differentiated club and ciliated cells from the organoid lumen to the exterior surface, thus displaying the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 on the outwardly-facing apical aspect.

While most SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors have a {gamma}-lactam glutamine surrogate at the P1 position, we recently discovered several Mpro inhibitors have hydrophobic moieties at the P1 site, including calpain inhibitors II/XII, which are also active against human cathepsin L, a host-protease that is important for viral entry. To determine the binding mode of these calpain inhibitors and establish a structure-activity relationship, we solved X-ray crystal structures of Mpro in complex with calpain inhibitors II and XII, and three analogues of GC-376, one of the most potent Mpro inhibitors in vitro. The structure of Mpro with calpain inhibitor II confirmed the S1 pocket of Mpro can accommodate a hydrophobic methionine side chain, challenging the idea that a hydrophilic residue is necessary at this position. Interestingly, the structure of calpain inhibitor XII revealed an unexpected, inverted binding pose where the P1 pyridine inserts in the S1 pocket and the P1 norvaline is positioned in the S1 pocket. The overall conformation is semi-helical, wrapping around the catalytic core, in contrast to the extended conformation of other peptidomimetic inhibitors.

The inhibition of the activity of the two key cytokines, IFN{gamma} and IL-6, can significantly reduce or even reverse the development of the cytokine storm. The objective of our investigations is to reveal the anti-inflammatory potential of heparin for prevention and suppression of the development of CRS in acute COVID-19 patients.

The effect of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) on IFN{gamma} signalling inside the stimulated WISH cells was investigated by measuring its antiproliferative activity and the translocation of phosphorylated STAT1 in the nucleus. The mechanism of heparin binding to IFN{gamma} and IL-6 and therefore inhibition of their activity was studied by means of extensive molecular-dynamics simulations. We find that LMWH binds with high affinity to IFN{gamma} and is able to inhibit fully the interaction with its cellular receptor. It also influences the biological activity of IL-6 by binding to either IL-6 or IL-6/IL-6R thus preventing the formation of the IL-6/IL-6R/gp130 signaling complex. Our conclusion is that heparin is a potent anti-inflammatory agent that can be used in acute inflammatory conditions, due to its potential to inhibit both IFN {gamma} and IL-6 signalling pathways. Based on our results and available clinical observations, we suggest the administration of LMWH to COVID-19 patients in the initial stages of the acute phase.

Understanding the interaction mechanism of viral and host proteins involved in different signaling pathways may help decipher the attacking mechanism on the signal transmission during diseases, followed by discovering appropriate therapeutic solutions.

The expression of any viral gene depends mostly on the host translational machinery. Recent studies report the great significance of codon usage biases in establishing host-viral protein-protein interactions (PPI). Exploiting the codon usage patterns between a pair of co-evolved host and viral proteins may present novel insight into the host-viral protein interactomes during disease pathogenesis. Leveraging the codon usage pattern similarity (and dissimilarity), we propose a computational scheme to recreate the hostviral protein interaction network (HVPPI). We use seventeen (17) essential signaling pathways for our current work and study the possible targeting mechanism of SARS-CoV2 viral proteins on such pathway proteins. We infer both negatively and positively interacting edges in the network. We can find a relationship where one host protein may target by more than one viral protein.

Extensive analysis performed to understand the network topologically and the attacking behavior of the viral proteins. Our study reveals that viral proteins, mostly utilize codons, rare in the targeted host proteins (negatively correlated interaction). Among non-structural proteins, NSP3 and structural protein, Spike (S) protein, are the most influential proteins in interacting multiple host proteins. In ranking the most affected pathways, MAPK pathways observe to be worst affected during the COVID-19 disease. A good number of targeted proteins are highly central in host protein interaction networks.

Largely overlooked has been the role of neutral pH in the respiratory tract, where we find that SARS-CoV stabilizes a transition state that enhances the off-rate from its receptor. An alternative pH-switch is found in CoV-2-like coronaviruses of tropical pangolins, but with a reversed phenotype where the tight interaction with ACE2 is at neutral pH. We show that a single point mutation in pangolin-CoV, unique to CoV-2, that deletes the last His residue in their receptor binding domain perpetuates this tight interaction independent of pH. This tight bond, not present in previous respiratory syndromes, implies that CoV-2 stays bound to the highly expressed ACE2 receptors in the nasal cavity about 100 times longer than CoV. This finding supports the unfamiliar pathology of CoV-2, observed virus retention in upper respiratory tract1, longer incubation times and extended periods of shedding.

The SARS-CoV-2 M protein, normally embedded in the virion membrane with its C-terminus extending into the virion core, independently induces N protein phase separation that is dependent on the N proteins C-terminal dimerization domain and disordered region. Three-component mixtures of N+M+RNA form condensates with mutually exclusive compartments containing N+M or N+RNA, including spherical annular structures in which the M protein coats the outside of an N+RNA condensate. These findings support a model in which phase separation of the N protein with both the viral genomic RNA and the SARS-CoV-2 M protein facilitates RNA packaging and virion assembly.",1,321,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.30.228023v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.30.228023v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2020.07.30.228023.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

In response to the growing threat of the COVID-19 pandemic in February, 2020, the FDA (US Food and Drug Administration) began issuing Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) to laboratories and commercial manufacturers for the development and implementation of diagnostic tests1. So far, the gold standard assay for SARS-CoV-2 detection is the RT-qPCR (real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction) test2. However, the authorized RT-qPCR test protocols vary widely, not only in the reagents, controls, and instruments they use, but also in the SARS-CoV-2 genes they target, what results constitute a positive SARS-CoV-2 infection, and their limit of detection (LoD). The FDA has provided a web site that lists most of the tests that have been issued EUAs, along with links to the authorization letters and summary documents describing these tests1. However, it is very challenging to use this site to compare or replicate these tests for a variety of reasons. First, at least 12 of 18 tests for EUA submissions made prior to March 31, 2020, are not listed there. To our knowledge, no EUAs have been issued for these applications. Second, the data are not standardized and are only provided as longhand prose in the summary documents. Third, some details (e.g. primer sequences) are absent from several of the test descriptions. Fourth, for tests provided by commercial manufacturers, summary documents are completely missing. To address at least the first three issues, we have developed a database, EUAdb (EUAdb.org), that holds standardized information about EUA-issued tests and is focused on RT-qPCR diagnostic tests, or ""high complexity molecular-based laboratory developed tests""1. By providing a standardized ontology and curated data in a relational architecture, we seek to facilitate comparability and reproducibility, with the ultimate goal of consistent, universal and high-quality testing nationwide. Here, we document the basics of the EUAdb data architecture and simple data queries. The source files can be provided to anyone who wants to modify the database for his/her own research purposes.

Although the mutation at the population level had been extensively investigated, how the mutations evolve at the individual level is largely unknown, partly due to the difficulty of obtaining unbiased genome coverage of SARS-CoV-2 directly from clinical samples.

MethodsEighteen time series fecal samples were collected from nine COVID-19 patients during the convalescent phase. The nucleic acids of SARS-CoV-2 were enriched by the hybrid capture method with different rounds of hybridization.

ResultsBy examining the sequencing depth, genome coverage, and allele frequency change, we demonstrated the impeccable performance of the hybrid capture method in samples with Ct value < 34, as well as significant improvement comparing to direct metatranscriptomic sequencing in samples with lower viral loads. We identified 229 intra-host variants at 182 sites in 18 fecal samples. Among them, nineteen variants presented frequency changes > 0.3 within 1-5 days, reflecting highly dynamic intra-host viral populations. Meanwhile, we also found that the same mutation showed different frequency changes in different individuals, indicating a strong random drift. Moreover, the evolving of the viral genome demonstrated that the virus was still viable in the gastrointestinal tract during the convalescent period.

ConclusionsThe hybrid capture method enables reliable analyses of inter- and intra-host variants of SARS-CoV-2 genome, which changed dramatically in the gastrointestinal tract; its clinical relevance warrants further investigation.",1,414,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.30.230102v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.30.230102v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2020.07.30.230102.txt,1,data availability statement,0,data availability viral reads were deposited in the genome warehouse in the national genomics data center (16) under project prjca2828,NA

Blocking this interaction provides a potent approach to preventing and controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this work, the ability of {beta}-chitosan to block the binding interaction between SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD and ACE2 was investigated. The inhibitory effect of {beta}-chitosan on inflammation induced by the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD was also studied. Native-PAGE analysis indicated that {beta}-chitosan could bind with ACE2 and the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD and a conjugate of {beta}-chitosan and ACE2 could no longer bind with the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD. HPLC analysis suggested that a conjugate of {beta}-chitosan and the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD displayed high binding affinity without dissociation under high pressure (40 MPa) compared with that of {beta}-chitosan and ACE2. Furthermore, immunofluorescent staining of Vero E6 cells and lungs from hACE2 mice showed that the presence of {beta}-chitosan prevented SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD from binding to ACE2. Meanwhile, {beta}-chitosan could dramatically suppress the inflammation caused by the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD both in vitro and vivo. Moreover, the decreased expression of ACE2 caused by {beta}-chitosan treatment was restored by addition of TAPI-1, an inhibitor of the transmembrane protease ADAM17. Our findings demonstrated that {beta}-chitosan displays an antibody-like function capable of neutralizing the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD and effectively preventing the binding of the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD to ACE2. Moreover, ADAM17 activation induced by {beta}-chitosan treatment can enhance the cleavage of the extracellular domain of ACE2, releasing the active ectodomain into the extracellular environment, which can prevent the binding, internalization, and degradation of ACE2 bound to the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD and thus diminish inflammation.

Since the first whole-genome sequence was published in January 2020, a growing database of tens of thousands of viral genomes has been constructed. This offers opportunities to study pathways of molecular change in the expanding viral population that can help identify molecular culprits of virulence and virus spread. Here we investigate the genomic accumulation of mutations at various time points of the early pandemic to identify changes in mutationally highly active genomic regions that are occurring worldwide. We used the Wuhan NC_045512.2 sequence as a reference and sampled 15,342 indexed sequences from GISAID, translating them into proteins and grouping them by month of deposition. The per-position amino acid frequencies and Shannon entropies of the coding sequences were calculated for each month, and a map of intrinsic disorder regions and binding sites was generated. The analysis revealed dominant variants, most of which were located in loop regions and on the surface of the proteins. Mutation entropy decreased between March and April of 2020 after steady increases at several sites, including the D614G mutation site of the spike (S) protein that was previously found associated with higher case fatality rates and at sites of the NSP 12 polymerase and the NSP13 helicase proteins. Notable expanding mutations include R203K and G204R of the nucleocapsid (N) protein inter-domain linker region and G251V of the viroporin encoded by ORF3a between March and April. The regions spanning these mutations exhibited significant intrinsic disorder, which was enhanced and decreased by the N-protein and viroporin 3a protein mutations, respectively. These results predict an ongoing mutational shift from the spike and replication complex to other regions, especially to encoded molecules known to represent major {beta}-interferon antagonists.

Thus, effective measures are needed to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission in indoor environments. In this regard, we have investigated whether a system based on a filter combining Tungsten Trioxide-Based (WO3) photocatalysis and an antiviral fabric treated-copper nanocluster could inactivate SARS-CoV-2. To this purpose, an infectious SARS-CoV-2 suspension was introduced in the upper opening of a closed cylinder containing a WO3 filter and a lightbased system that activates WO3 and the antiviral fabric. From the bottom exit, aliquots of fluid were collected every 10 min (up to 60 min) and tested for their infectivity by means of a viral plaque assay in Vero cells whereas, in parallel, the viral RNA content was measured by quantitative PCR (qPCR). As we have previously shown for SARS-CoV, a 1:1,000 ratio of plaque forming units (PFU) vs. viral RNA copies was observed also for SARS-CoV-2. After 10 min, the infectious viral content was already decreased by 98.2% reaching 100% inactivation after 30 min whereas the SARS-CoV-2 RNA load was decreased of 1.5 log10 after 30 min. Thus, in spite of only a partial decrease of viral RNA, SARS-CoV-2 infectivity was completely abolished by the WO3 photocatalysis system by 30 min.

The nsp13 of highly pathogenic MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and SARS-CoV exhibit the most conserved CoV replicases. Using single-molecule FRET, we observed that MERS-CoV nsp13 unwound DNA in discrete steps of approximately 9 bp when ATP was used. If another NTP was used, then the steps were only 4 to 5 bp. In dwell time analysis, we detected 3 or 4 hidden steps in each unwinding process, which indicated the hydrolysis of 3 or 4 dTTP. Based on crystallographic and biochemical studies of CoV nsp13 helicases, we modeled an unwinding mechanism similar to the spring-loaded mechanism of HCV NS3 helicase, although our model proposes that flexible 1B and stalk domains, by allowing a lag greater than 4 bp during unwinding, cause the accumulated tension on the nsp13-DNA complex. The hinge region between two RecA-like domains in SARS-CoV-2 nsp13 is intrinsically more flexible than in MERS-CoV nsp13 due to the difference of a single amino acid, which causes the former to induce significantly greater NTP hydrolysis. Our findings thus establish a blueprint for determining the unwinding mechanism of a unique helicase family.

Viral RNA was not detected in blood but transiently in nasal, oropharyngeal and rectal swabs and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid as well as various tissues. Tracheobronchoadenitis of submucosal glands with the presence of viral RNA and antigen was observed in airways of the infected cats on 4 and 7 DPC. Serology showed that both, principal and sentinel cats, developed SARS-CoV-2-specific and neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 detectable at 7 DPC or 10 DPC, respectively. All animals were clinically asymptomatic during the course of the study and capable of transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to sentinels within 2 days of comingling.

Although the capacity for recombination among betacoronaviruses is well documented, there is limited evidence of recombination between SARS-CoV-2 strains. By identifying the mutations that primarily determine SARS-CoV-2 clade structure, we developed a lightweight approach for detecting recombinant genomes. Among the over 537,000 genomes queried, we detect 1175 putative recombinants that contain multiple mutational markers from distinct clades. Additional phylogenetic analysis and the observed co-circulation of predicted parent clades in the geographic regions of exposure further support the feasibility of recombination in these detected cases. An analysis of these detected cases did not reveal any evidence for recombination hotspots in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Although most recombinant genotypes were detected a limited number of times, at least two recombinants are now widely transmitted. Recombinant genomes were also found to contain substitutions of concern for elevated transmissibility and lower vaccine efficacy, including D614G, N501Y, E484K, and L452R. Adjusting for an unequal probability of detecting recombinants derived from different parent clades, and for geographic variation in clade abundance, we estimate that at most 5% of circulating viruses in the USA and UK are recombinant.

As with other coronaviruses, a preponderance of evidence suggests the virus originated in horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus spp.) and likely underwent a recombination event in an intermediate host prior to entry into human populations. A significant concern is that SARS-CoV-2 could become established in secondary reservoir hosts outside of Asia. To assess this potential, we challenged deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) with SARS-CoV-2 and found robust virus replication in the upper respiratory tract, lungs and intestines, with detectable viral RNA for up to 21 days in oral swabs and 14 days in lungs. Virus entry into the brain also occurred, likely via gustatory-olfactory-trigeminal pathway with eventual compromise to the blood brain barrier. Despite this, no conspicuous signs of disease were observed and no deer mice succumbed to infection. Expression of several innate immune response genes were elevated in the lungs, notably IFN, Cxcl10, Oas2, Tbk1 and Pycard. Elevated CD4 and CD8{beta} expression in the lungs was concomitant with Tbx21, IFN{gamma} and IL-21 expression, suggesting a type I inflammatory immune response. Contact transmission occurred from infected to naive deer mice through two passages, showing sustained natural transmission. In the second deer mouse passage, an insertion of 4 amino acids occurred to fixation in the N-terminal domain of the spike protein that is predicted to form a solvent-accessible loop. Subsequent examination of the source virus from BEI Resources indicated the mutation was present at very low levels, demonstrating potent purifying selection for the insert during in vivo passage.

Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 rapidly adapts to Vero E6 cells that leads to loss of furin cleavage motif in spike protein. The adaptation is achieved by asymptotic expansion of minor virus subpopulations to dominant genotype, but wildtype sequence is maintained at low percentage in the virus swarm, and mediate reverse adaptation once the virus is passaged on human lung cells. The Vero E6-adapted virus show defected cell entry in human lung cells and the mutated spike variants cannot be processed by furin or TMPRSS2. However, the mutated S1/S2 site is cleaved by cathepsins with higher efficiency. Our data show that SARS-CoV-2 can rapidly adapt spike protein to available proteases and advocate for deep sequence surveillance to identify virus adaptation potential and novel variant emergence.

Significance StatementRecently emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants B1.1.1.7 (UK), B.1.351 (South Africa) and B.1.1.248 (Brazil) harbor spike mutation and have been linked to increased virus pathogenesis. The emergence of these novel variants highlight coronavirus adaptation and evolution potential, despite the stable consensus genotype of clinical isolates. We show that subdominant variants maintained in the virus population enable the virus to rapidly adapt upon selection pressure. Although these adaptations lead to genotype change, the change is not absolute and genome with original genotype are maintained in virus swarm.

Several animal models have been rapidly developed that recapitulate the asymptomatic to moderate disease spectrum. Now, there is a direct need for additional small animal models to study the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 and for fast-tracked medical countermeasure development. Here, we show that transgenic mice expressing the human SARS-CoV-2 receptor (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 [hACE2]) under a cytokeratin 18 promoter (K18) are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and that infection resulted in a dose-dependent lethal disease course. After inoculation with either 104 TCID50 or 105 TCID50, the SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in rapid weight loss in both groups and uniform lethality in the 105 TCID50 group. High levels of viral RNA shedding were observed from the upper and lower respiratory tract and intermittent shedding was observed from the intestinal tract. Inoculation with SARS-CoV-2 resulted in upper and lower respiratory tract infection with high infectious virus titers in nasal turbinates, trachea and lungs. The observed interstitial pneumonia and pulmonary pathology, with SARS-CoV-2 replication evident in pneumocytes, were similar to that reported in severe cases of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in macrophage and lymphocyte infiltration in the lungs and upregulation of Th1 and proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines. Extrapulmonary replication of SARS-CoV-2 was observed in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of several animals at 7 DPI but not at 3 DPI. The rapid inflammatory response and observed pathology bears resemblance to COVID-19. Taken together, this suggests that this mouse model can be useful for studies of pathogenesis and medical countermeasure development.

Authors SummaryThe disease manifestation of COVID-19 in humans range from asymptomatic to severe. While several mild to moderate disease models have been developed, there is still a need for animal models that recapitulate the severe and fatal progression observed in a subset of patients. Here, we show that humanized transgenic mice developed dose-dependent disease when inoculated with SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of COVID-19. The mice developed upper and lower respiratory tract infection, with virus replication also in the brain after day 3 post inoculation. The pathological and immunological diseases manifestation observed in these mice bears resemblance to human COVID-19, suggesting increased usefulness of this model for elucidating COVID-19 pathogenesis further and testing of countermeasures, both of which are urgently needed.",1,322,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.11.246314v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.11.246314v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2020.08.11.246314.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

The pandemic has impacted public health, the economy and our society on a global scale. In addition, the impacts of COVID-19 permeate into our environment and wildlife as well. Here, we discuss the essential role of wastewater treatment and management during these times. A consequence of poor wastewater management is the discharge of untreated wastewater carrying infectious SARS-CoV-2 into natural water systems that are home to marine mammals. Here, we predict the susceptibility of marine mammal species using a modelling approach. We identified that many species of whale, dolphin and seal, as well as otters, are predicted to be highly susceptible to infection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In addition, geo-mapping highlights how current wastewater management in Alaska may lead to susceptible marine mammal populations being exposed to the virus. Localities such as Cold Bay, Naknek, Dillingham and Palmer may require additional treatment of their wastewater to prevent virus spillover through sewage. Since over half of these susceptibility species are already at risk worldwide, the release of the virus via untreated wastewater could have devastating consequences for their already declining populations. For these reasons, we discuss approaches that can be taken by the public, policymakers and wastewater treatment facilities to reduce the risk of virus spillover in our natural water systems.

In vitro, HCQ effectively inhibits viral entry, but its use in the clinic has been hampered by conflicting results. A better understanding of HCQs mechanism of actions in vitro is needed to resolve these conflicts. Recently, anesthetics were shown to disrupt ordered monosialotetrahexosylganglioside1 (GM1) lipid rafts. These same lipid rafts recruit the SARS-CoV-2 surface receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to an endocytic entry point, away from phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate (PIP2) domains. Here we employed super resolution imaging of cultured mammalian cells to show HCQ directly perturbs GM1 lipid rafts and inhibits the ability of ACE2 receptor to associate with the endocytic pathway. HCQ also disrupts PIP2 domains and their ability to cluster and sequester ACE2. Similarly, the antibiotic erythromycin inhibits viral entry and both HCQ and erythromycin decrease the antimicrobial host defense peptide amyloid beta in cultured cells. We conclude HCQ is an anesthetic-like compound that disrupts GM1 lipid rafts similar to anesthetics. The disruption likely decreases viral clustering at both endocytic and putative PIP2 entry points.

KEY POINTSQuestion: What is the molecular basis for antiviral activity of hydroxychloroquine?

Findings: Hydroxychloroquine disrupt lipid rafts similar to general anesthetics.

Meaning: Since lipids cluster ACE2 and facilitate viral entry, hydroxychloroquine appears to inhibit viral entry by disrupting the lipid clustering of the SARS-CoV2 receptor.",1,84,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.13.250217v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.13.250217v2.full.pdf,_10.1101_2020.08.13.250217.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Activation of the Jak-Stat pathway by Interferon-alpha/beta (IFN-/{beta}) in lung epithelial cells is critical for innate immunity to respiratory viruses. Genetic and biochemical studies have shown that transcriptional regulation by IFN-/{beta} required the formation of Interferon-stimulated gene factor-3 (ISGF-3) complex consisting of Stat1, Stat2, and Irf9 transcription factors. Furthermore, IFN /{beta} receptor activates multiple signal transduction pathways in parallel to the Jak-Stat pathway and induces several transcription factors at mRNA levels resulting in the secondary and tertiary rounds of transcription. Transcriptional factor profiling in the transcriptome and RNA analysis revealed that Early growth response-1 (Egr-1) was rapidly induced by IFN-/{beta} and Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands in multiple cell types. Studies in mutant cell lines lacking components of the ISGF-3 complex revealed that IFN-{beta} induction of Egr-1 was independent of Stat1, Stat2, or Irf9. Activation of the Mek/Erk-1/2 pathway was implicated in the rapid induction of Egr-1 by IFN-{beta} in serum-starved mouse lung epithelial cells. Interrogation of multiple microarray datasets revealed that respiratory viruses including coronaviruses regulated Egr-1 expression in human lung cell lines.

To decipher any correlation between SARS-CoV-2 evolution and its epidemiology in India, we studied the mutational diversity of spike glycoprotein, the key player for the attachment, fusion and entry of virus to the host cell. For this, we analyzed the sequences of 630 Indian isolates as available in GISAID database till June 07, 2020, and detected the spike protein variants to emerge from two major ancestors - Wuhan-Hu-1/2019 and its D614G variant. Average stability of the docked spike protein - host receptor (S-R) complexes for these variants correlated strongly (R2=0.96) with the fatality rates across Indian states. However, while more than half of the variants were found unique to India, 67% of all variants showed lower stability of S-R complex than the respective ancestral variants, indicating a possible fitness loss in recently emerged variants, despite a continuous increase in mutation rate. These results conform to the sharply declining fatality rate countrywide (>7-fold during April 11 - June 28, 2020). Altogether, while we propose the potential of S-R complex stability to track disease severity, we urge an immediate need to explore if SARS-CoV-2 is approaching mutational meltdown in India.

Author summaryEpidemiological features are intricately linked to evolutionary diversity of rapidly evolving pathogens, and SARS-CoV-2 is no exception. Our work suggests the potential of average stability of complexes formed by the circulating spike mutational variants and the human host receptor to track the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a given region. In India, the stability of these complexes for recent variants tend to decrease relative to their ancestral ones, following countrywide declining fatality rate, in contrast to an increasing mutation rate. We hypothesize such a scenario as nascent footprints of Mullers ratchet, proposing large-scale population genomics study for its validation, since this understanding could lead to therapeutic approaches for facilitating mutational meltdown of SARS-CoV-2, as experienced earlier for influenza A virus.",1,83,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.18.255570v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.18.255570v2.full.pdf,_10.1101_2020.08.18.255570.txt,1,supplement,0,the mutation positions in the  237  secondary structures of the analyzed variants are detailed in the s1 dataset in supporting  238  information.;     557  dataset s1: positional information of the spike protein mutations in the docked s-r complex.  558 559 560 561 562 563 564 565 566 567 23   biorxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.18.255570; this version posted october 7 2020.,NA

The zoonotic virus most likely originated from bats, but definite intermediate hosts have not yet been identified.

Here we demonstrate susceptibility of raccoon dogs for SARS-CoV-2 infection after intranasal inoculation and transmission to direct contact animals. Rapid, high level virus shedding, in combination with minor clinical signs and pathohistological changes, seroconversion and absence of viral adaptation highlight the role of raccoon dogs as a potential intermediate host. The results are highly relevant for control strategies and emphasize the risk that raccoon dogs may represent a potential SARS-CoV-2 reservoir.

Our assay measures both recombinant NP and endogenous NP from viral lysates and tissue culture supernatants (TCS) in a sandwich-based format using two monoclonal antibodies against the NP analyte. Viral NP was detected and quantified in both tissue culture supernatants and cell lysates, with large differences observed between 24 hours and 48 hours of infection. We simulated the viral infection by spiking in recombinant NP into 384-well plates with live Vero-E6 cells and were able to detect the NP with high sensitivity and a large dynamic range. Anti-viral agents that inhibit either viral cell entry or replication will decrease the AlphaLISA NP signal. Thus, this assay can be used for high-throughput screening of small molecules and biologics in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.",1,282,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.20.258129v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.20.258129v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2020.08.20.258129.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

We report that astodrimer sodium inhibits replication of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 and Calu-3 cells, with 50% effective concentrations (EC50) for i) reducing virus-induced cytopathic effect of 0.002 to 0.012 mg/mL in Vero E6 cells, and ii) infectious virus release by plaque assay of 0.019 to 0.031 mg/mL in Vero E6 cells and 0.031 to 0.045 mg/mL in Calu-3 cells. The selectivity index (SI) in these assays was as high as 2197. Astodrimer sodium was also virucidal, reducing SARS-CoV-2 infectivity by >99.9% (>3 log10) within 1 minute of exposure, and up to >99.999% (>5 log10) shown at astodrimer sodium concentrations of 10 to 30 mg/mL in Vero E6 and Calu-3 cell lines. Astodrimer sodium also inhibited infection in a primary human airway epithelial cell line. The data were similar for all investigations and were consistent with the potent antiviral and virucidal activity of astodrimer sodium being due to inhibition of virus-host cell interactions, as previously demonstrated for other viruses. Further studies will confirm if astodrimer sodium binds to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and physically blocks initial attachment of the virus to the host cell. Given the in vitro effectiveness and significantly high SI, astodrimer sodium warrants further investigation for potential as a nasally administered or inhaled antiviral agent for SARS-CoV-2 prevention and treatment applications.",1,18,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.20.260190v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.20.260190v2.full.pdf,_10.1101_2020.08.20.260190.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Like in SARS-CoV, horseshoe bats currently represent the most likely candidate animal source for SARS-CoV-2. Yet, the specific mechanisms of cross-species transmission and adaptation to the human host remain unknown. Here we show that the unsupervised analysis of conservation patterns across the {beta}-CoV spike protein family, using sequence information alone, can provide rich information on the molecular basis of the specificity of {beta}-CoVs to different host cell receptors. More precisely, our results indicate that host cell receptor usage is encoded in the amino acid sequences of different CoV spike proteins in the form of a set of specificity determining positions (SDPs). Furthermore, by integrating structural data, in silico mutagenesis and coevolution analysis we could elucidate the role of SDPs in mediating ACE2 binding across the Sarbecovirus lineage, either by engaging the receptor through direct intermolecular interactions or by affecting the local environment of the receptor binding motif. Finally, by the analysis of coevolving mutations across a paired MSA we were able to identify key intermolecular contacts occurring at the spike-ACE2 interface. These results show that effective mining of the evolutionary records held in the sequence of the spike protein family can help tracing the molecular mechanisms behind the evolution and host-receptors adaptation of circulating and future novel {beta}-CoVs.

SignificanceUnraveling the molecular basis for host cell receptor usage among {beta}-CoVs is crucial to our understanding of cross-species transmission, adaptation and for molecular-guided epidemiological monitoring of potential outbreaks. In the present study, we survey the sequence conservation patterns of the {beta}-CoV spike protein family to identify the evolutionary constraints shaping the functional specificity of the protein across the {beta}-CoV lineage. We show that the unsupervised analysis of statistical patterns in a MSA of the spike protein family can help tracing the amino acid space encoding the specificity of {beta}-CoVs to their cognate host cell receptors. We argue that the results obtained in this work can provide a framework for monitoring the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 specificity to the hACE2 receptor, as the virus continues spreading in the human population and differential virulence starts to arise.",1,375,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.21.260745v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.21.260745v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2020.08.21.260745.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

SARS-CoV-2 infection induced a cytotoxic response of CD8+ T cells, but not CD4+ T cells, characterized by the simultaneous production of granzyme A and B, as well as perforin within different effector CD8+ T cell subsets. PD-1 expressing CD8+ T cells also produced cytotoxic molecules during acute infection indicating that they were not functionally exhausted. However, in COVID-19 patients over the age of 80 years the cytotoxic T cell potential was diminished, especially in effector memory and terminally differentiated effector CD8+ cells, showing that elderly patients have impaired cellular immunity against SARS-CoV-2.

Our data provides valuable information about T cell responses in COVID-19 patients that may also have important implications for vaccine development.

ImportanceCytotoxic T cells are responsible for the elimination of infected cells and are key players for the control of viruses. CD8+ T cells with an effector phenotype express cytotoxic molecules and are able to perform target cell killing. COVID-19 patients with a mild disease course were analyzed for the differentiation status and cytotoxic profile of CD8+ T cells. SARS-CoV-2 infection induced a vigorous cytotoxic CD8+ T cell response. However, this cytotoxic profile of T cells was not detected in COVID-19 patients over the age of 80 years.

We have determined the full-length SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences of cancer patients and healthcare workers (HCW; non-cancer controls) by deep sequencing and investigated the within-host viral quasispecies of each infection, quantifying intrahost genetic diversity. Naso- and oropharyngeal SARS-CoV-2+ swabs from 57 cancer patients and 14 healthcare workers (HCW) from the Brazilian Cancer Institute were collected in April-May 2020. Complete genome amplification using ARTIC network V3 multiplex primers was performed followed by next-generation sequencing. Assemblies were conducted in Geneious R11, where consensus sequences were extracted and intrahost single nucleotide variants (iSNVs) were identified. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis was performed using PhyMLv.3.0 and lineages were classified using Pangolin and CoV-GLUE. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all but one strain belonged to clade B1.1. Four genetically linked mutations known as the globally dominant SARS-CoV-2 haplotype (C241T, C3037T, C14408T and A23403G) were found in the majority of consensus sequences. SNV signatures of previously characterized Brazilian genomes were also observed in most samples. Another 85 SNVs were found at a lower frequency (1.4-19.7%). Cancer patients displayed a significantly higher intrahost viral genetic diversity compared to HCW (p = 0.009). Intrahost genetic diversity in cancer patients was independent of SARS-CoV-2 Ct values, and was not associated with disease severity, use of corticosteroids, or use of antivirals, characteristics that could influence viral diversity. Such a feature may explain, at least in part, the more adverse outcomes to which cancer/COVID-19 patients experience.

Author SummaryCancer patients are more prone to clinically evolve to more severe COVID-19 conditions, but the determinants of such a more severe outcome remain largely unknown. In this study, phylogenetic and variation analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from cancer patients and non-cancer healthcare workers at the Brazilian National Cancer Institute were characterized by deep sequencing. Viral genomes showed signatures characteristic of Brazilian viruses, consistent with the hypothesis of local, community transmission rather than virus importation from abroad. Despite most genomes in patients and healthcare workers belonging to the same lineage, intrahost variability was higher in cancer patients when compared to non-cancer counterparts. The intrahost genomic diversity analysis presented in our study highlights the relaxed evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in a vulnerable population of cancer patients. The high number of minor variations can result in the selection of immune escape variants, resistance to potential drugs, and/or increased pathogenicity. The impact of this higher intrahost variability over time warrants further investigation.",1,310,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.26.267831v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.26.267831v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2020.08.26.267831.txt,0,NA,1,NA,for sars-cov-2 lineage classification consensus genomes were submitted to pangolin software (https://github.com/cov-lineages/pangolin downloaded on june 10th 2020) and to cov-glue lineage system (http://cov-glue.cvr.gla.ac.uk/#/home accessed on june 10th 2020)[25] both based on the nomenclature proposed by rambaut et al [26].

Intraperitoneal injections of SAP starting from day 1 post ORN06 aspiration attenuated the ORN06-induced increase in the number of inflammatory cells and formation of clot-like aggregates in the mouse lung fluid, reduced ORN06-increased alveolar wall thickness and accumulation of exudates in the alveolar airspace, and attenuated an ORN06-induced upregulation of the inflammatory cytokines IL-1{beta}, IL-6, IL-12p70, IL-23, and IL-27 in serum. Together, these results suggest that aspiration of ORN06 is a simple model for both COVID-19 as well as cytokine storm in general, and that SAP is a potential therapeutic for diseases with COVID-19-like symptoms as well as diseases that generate a cytokine storm.",1,402,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.26.269183v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.26.269183v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2020.08.26.269183.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

The polarized human airway epithelium (HAE) cultured at an airway-liquid interface (HAE-ALI) is an in vitro model mimicking the in vivo human mucociliary airway epithelium and supports the replication of SARS-CoV-2. However, previous studies only characterized short-period SARS-CoV-2 infection in HAE. In this study, continuously monitoring the SARS-CoV-2 infection in HAE-ALI cultures for a long period of up to 51 days revealed that SARS-CoV-2 infection was long lasting with recurrent replication peaks appearing between an interval of approximately 7-10 days, which was consistent in all the tested HAE-ALI cultures derived from 4 lung bronchi of independent donors. We also identified that SARS-CoV-2 does not infect HAE from the basolateral side, and the dominant SARS-CoV-2 permissive epithelial cells are ciliated cells and goblet cells, whereas virus replication in basal cells and club cells was not detectable. Notably, virus infection immediately damaged the HAE, which is demonstrated by dispersed Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) expression without clear tight junctions and partial loss of cilia. Importantly, we identified that SARS-CoV-2 productive infection of HAE requires a high viral load of 2.5 x 105 virions per cm2 of epithelium. Thus, our studies highlight the importance of a high viral load and that epithelial renewal initiates and maintains a recurrent infection of HAE with SARS-CoV-2.",1,294,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.27.271130v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.27.271130v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2020.08.27.271130.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

In this study, we established a SCoV-2 Spike glycoprotein (SP), including a SP mutant D614G, pseudotyped HIV-1-based vector system and tested their ability to infect ACE2-expressing cells. This study revealed that a C-terminal 17 amino acid deletion in SCoV-2 SP significantly increases the incorporation of SP into the pseudotyped viruses and enhanced its infectivity, which may be helpful in the design of SCoV2-SP-based vaccine strategies. Moreover, based on this system, we have demonstrated that an aqueous extract from the Chinese herb Prunella vulgaris (CHPV) and a compound, suramin, displayed potent inhibitory effects on both wild type and mutant (G614) SCoV-2 SP pseudotyped virus (SCoV-2-SP-PVs)-mediated infection. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) for CHPV and suramin on SCoV-2-SP-PVs are 30, and 40 g/ml, respectively. To define the mechanisms of their actions, we demonstrated that both CHPV and suramin are able to directly interrupt SCoV-2-SP binding to its receptor ACE2 and block the viral entry step. Importantly, our results also showed that CHPV or suramin can efficiently reduce levels of cytopathic effect caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus (hCoV-19/Canada/ON-VIDO-01/2020) infection in Vero cells.

There is a dire need for novel effective antivirals to treat COVID-19, as the only approved direct-acting antiviral to date is remdesivir, targeting the viral polymerase complex. A potential alternate target in the viral life cycle is the main SARS-CoV-2 protease 3CLpro (Mpro). The drug candidate PF-00835231 is the active compound of the first anti-3CLpro regimen in clinical trials. Here, we perform a comparative analysis of PF-00835231, the pre-clinical 3CLpro inhibitor GC-376, and the polymerase inhibitor remdesivir, in alveolar basal epithelial cells modified to express ACE2 (A549+ACE2 cells). We find PF-00835231 with at least similar or higher potency than remdesivir or GC-376. A time-of-drug-addition approach delineates the timing of early SARS-CoV-2 life cycle steps in A549+ACE2 cells and validates PF-00835231s early time of action. In a model of the human polarized airway epithelium, both PF-00835231 and remdesivir potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 at low micromolar concentrations. Finally, we show that the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein, which was previously suggested to diminish PF-00835231s efficacy based on experiments in monkey kidney Vero E6 cells, does not negatively impact PF-00835231 efficacy in either A549+ACE2 cells or human polarized airway epithelial cultures. Thus, our study provides in vitro evidence for the potential of PF-00835231 as an effective SARS-CoV-2 antiviral and addresses concerns that emerged based on prior studies in non-human in vitro models.

ImportanceThe arsenal of SARS-CoV-2 specific antiviral drugs is extremely limited. Only one direct-acting antiviral drug is currently approved, the viral polymerase inhibitor remdesivir, and it has limited efficacy. Thus, there is a substantial need to develop additional antiviral compounds with minimal side effects and alternate viral targets. One such alternate target is its main protease, 3CLpro (Mpro), an essential component of the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle processing the viral polyprotein into the components of the viral polymerase complex. In this study, we characterize a novel antiviral drug, PF-00835231, which is the active component of the first-in-class 3CLpro-targeting regimen in clinical trials.

The ability to model human trophectoderm disease states from human pluripotent stem cells, the nature of human pluripotent stem cell potency and the mechanisms regulating human trophectoderm specification remains poorly understood. Recent work suggests that only the naive state can give rise to trophectoderm and that primed iPSC generate mixed amnionic and mesoderm lineages. Here we identify conditions that efficiently drive the specification of primed iPSC to trophectoderm, named Trophoblast Stem Cell (TSC). iPS-derived-TSC share transcriptional, morphological and functional characteristics with human in vivo cytotrophoblasts including activation of human endogenous retroviruses, expression of COVID-19 associated host factors and generation of multinucleated syncytiotrophoblasts with a large fusion index. At high densities in 5% O2, iPS-derived-TSC form villi-like structures and express extravillous and syncytiotrophoblast proteins HCG-{beta} and HLA-G.

With 9,821 high-quality single cell transcriptomes, we find that BMP4 gives rise to mesenchymal cells while TS conditions lacking exogenous BMP4 generate a stable proliferating cell type that is highly similar to six week placenta cytotrophoblasts.

The shortest path to clinical use is repurposing of drugs that have an established safety profile in humans. Here, we first screened a library of 1,900 clinically safe drugs for inhibiting replication of OC43, a human beta-coronavirus that causes the common-cold and is a relative of SARS-CoV-2, and identified 108 effective drugs. We further evaluated the top 26 hits and determined their ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2, as well as other pathogenic RNA viruses. 20 of the 26 drugs significantly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in human lung cells (A549 epithelial cell line), with EC50 values ranging from 0.1 to 8 micromolar. We investigated the mechanism of action for these and found that masitinib, a drug originally developed as a tyrosine-kinase inhibitor for cancer treatment, strongly inhibited the activity of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease 3CLpro. X-ray crystallography revealed that masitinib directly binds to the active site of 3CLpro, thereby blocking its enzymatic activity. Mastinib also inhibited the related viral protease of picornaviruses and blocked picornaviruses replication. Thus, our results show that masitinib has broad anti-viral activity against two distinct beta-coronaviruses and multiple picornaviruses that cause human disease and is a strong candidate for clinical trials to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection.",1,374,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.274639v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.274639v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2020.08.31.274639.txt,1,"field-specific repository, supplement, data availability statement",0,the x-ray structure of 3clpro-bound masitinib has been deposited to pdf under accession number 7ju7.  18   biorxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.31.274639; this version posted september 1 2020.     table 1. summary of crystallographic data data availability all data are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request. the x-ray structure of 3clpro-bound masitinib has been deposited to pdf under accession number 7ju7,NA

Characterization of humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, including immunoglobulin isotype usage, neutralizing activity and memory B cell generation, is necessary to provide critical insights on the formation of immune memory in Indian subjects. In this study, we evaluated SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific IgG, IgM, and IgA antibody responses, neutralization of live virus, and RBD-specific memory B cell responses in pre-pandemic healthy versus convalescent COVID-19 individuals from India. We observed substantial heterogeneity in the formation of humoral and B cell memory post COVID-19 recovery. While a vast majority (38/42, 90.47%) of COVID-19 recovered individuals developed SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific IgG responses, only half of them had appreciable neutralizing antibody titers. RBD-specific IgG titers correlated with these neutralizing antibody titers as well as with RBD-specific memory B cell frequencies. In contrast, IgG titers measured against SARS-CoV-2 whole virus preparation, which includes responses to additional viral proteins besides RBD, did not show robust correlation. Our results suggest that assessing RBD-specific IgG titers can serve as a surrogate assay to determine the neutralizing antibody response. These observations have timely implications for identifying potential plasma therapy donors based on RBD-specific IgG in resource-limited settings where routine performance of neutralization assays remains a challenge.

ImportanceOur study provides an understanding of SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies, binding antibodies and memory B cells in COVID-19 convalescent subjects from India. Our study highlights that PCR-confirmed convalescent COVID-19 individuals develop SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific IgG antibodies, which correlate strongly with their neutralizing antibody titers. RBD-specific IgG titers, thus, can serve as a valuable surrogate measurement for neutralizing antibody responses.

Although the viral infection originates in the respiratory system, it is unclear how the virus can overcome the alveolar barrier, which is observed in severe COVID-19 disease courses.

To elucidate the viral effects on the barrier integrity and immune reactions, we used mono-cell culture systems and a complex human alveolus-on-a-chip model composed of epithelial, endothelial, and mononuclear cells.

Our data show that SARS-CoV-2 efficiently infected epithelial cells with high viral loads and inflammatory response, including the interferon expression. By contrast, the adjacent endothelial layer was no infected and did neither show productive virus replication or interferon release. With prolonged infection, both cell types are damaged, and the barrier function is deteriorated, allowing the viral particles to overbear.

In our study, we demonstrate that although SARS-CoV-2 is dependent on the epithelium for efficient replication, the neighboring endothelial cells are affected, e.g., by the epithelial cytokine release, which results in the damage of the alveolar barrier function and viral dissemination.",1,549,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.276725v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.276725v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2020.08.31.276725.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

These COVID-19 comorbidities are exacerbated by the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS), which normally protects from rapidly dropping blood pressure or dehydration via the peptide Angiotensin II (Ang II) produced by the enzyme Ace. The Ace paralog Ace2 degrades Ang II, thus counteracting its chronic effects. Ace2 is also the SARS-CoV-2 receptor. Ace, the coronavirus, and COVID-19 comorbidities all regulate Ace2, but we dont yet understand how. To exploit zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a disease model to understand mechanisms regulating the RAAS and its relationship to COVID-19 comorbidities, we must first identify zebrafish orthologs and co-orthologs of human RAAS genes, and second, understand where and when these genes are expressed in specific cells in zebrafish development. To achieve these goals, we conducted genomic analyses and investigated single cell transcriptomes. Results showed that most human RAAS genes have an ortholog in zebrafish and some have two or more co-orthologs. Results further identified a specific intestinal cell type in zebrafish larvae as the site of expression for key RAAS components, including Ace, Ace2, the coronavirus co-receptor Slc6a19, and the Angiotensin-related peptide cleaving enzymes Anpep and Enpep. Results also identified specific vascular cell subtypes as expressing Ang II receptors, apelin, and apelin receptor genes. These results identify specific genes and cell types to exploit zebrafish as a disease model for understanding the mechanisms leading to COVID-19 comorbidities.

(2) These regions are also enriched for 5 and 3 breakpoints in the transcription regulatory site (TRS) independent transcriptome, presumably sites of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) template-switching. (3) Within raw reads, these structural variant hotspots have cases of both high intra-host heterogeneity and intra-host homogeneity, suggesting that these structural variants are both consequences of de novo recombination events within a host and artifacts of previous recombination.

We estimate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies in District Srinagar.

Methods2906 persons >18 years of age selected from hospital visitors across District Srinagar participated in the study. We tested samples for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies using a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay-based serologic test.

ResultsAge- and gender-standardized seroprevalence was 3.6% (95% CI 2.9% to 4.3%). Age 30-69 years, a recent history of symptoms of an influenza-like-illness, and a history of being placed under quarantine were significantly related to higher odds of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies. The estimated number of SARS-CoV-2 infections during the two weeks preceding the study, adjusted for test performance, was 32602 with an estimated (median) infection-to-known-case ratio of 46 (95% CI 36 to 57).

ConclusionsThe seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies is low in the District. A large proportion of the population is still susceptible to the infection. A sizeable number of infections remain undetected, and a substantial proportion of people with symptoms compatible with COVID-19 are not tested.",1,563,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.04.282640v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.04.282640v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2020.09.04.282640.txt,1,supplement,0,; 2020. doi:10.1186/s12979-020-  401  00180-2  402  403  supporting information captions  404  s1 data.,NA

Following receptor-recognition, proteolytic cleavage between S1 and S2 subunits of the spike protein occurs with subsequent release of fusion peptide. Here, we report our study on allosteric communication within RBD that propagates the signal from ACE2-binding site towards allosteric site for the post-binding activation of proteolytic cleavage. Using MD simulations, we have demonstrated allosteric crosstalk within RBD in apo- and receptor-bound states where dynamic correlated motions and electrostatic energy perturbations contribute. While allostery, based on correlated motions, dominates inherent distal communication in apo-RBD, electrostatic energy perturbations determine favorable crosstalk within RBD upon binding to ACE2. Notably, allosteric path is constituted with evolutionarily conserved residues pointing towards their biological relevance. As revealed from recent structures, in the trimeric arrangement of spike, RBD of one copy interacts with S2 domain of another copy. Interestingly, the allosteric site identified is in direct contact (H-bonded) with a region in RBD that corresponds to the interacting region of RBD of one copy with S2 of another copy in trimeric constitution. Apparently, inter-monomer allosteric communication orchestrates concerted action of the trimer.

Poly(A) Binding Protein Cytoplasmic 4 (PABPC4), Serine/Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitor Clade G Member 1 (SERPING1) and Vitamin K epOxide Reductase Complex subunit 1 (VKORC1), which are all proteins linked to coagulation, have been shown to interact with SARS proteins.

Potential mechanisms by which some of these variants may contribute to disease are proposed. Some of these variants are prevalent in minority groups that are disproportionally affected by severe COVID-19. Therefore, we are proposing that further investigation around these variants may lead to better understanding of disease pathogenesis in minority groups and more informed therapeutic approaches.

Author summaryIncreased blood clotting, especially in the lungs, is a common complication of COVID-19. Infectious diseases cause inflammation which in turn can contribute to increased blood clotting. However, the extent of clot formation that is seen in the lungs of COVID-19 patients suggests that there may be a more direct link. We identified three human proteins that are involved indirectly in the blood clotting cascade and have been shown to interact with proteins of SARS virus, which is closely related to the novel coronavirus. We examined computationally the interaction of these human proteins with the viral proteins. We looked for genetic variants of these proteins and examined how these variants are distributed across populations. We investigated whether variants of these genes could impact severity of COVID-19. Further investigation around these variants may provide clues for the pathogenesis of COVID-19 particularly in minority groups.",1,110,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.08.272328v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.08.272328v2.full.pdf,_10.1101_2020.09.08.272328.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

The molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of the disease are not completely elucidated. Thus, we aim to understand host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection by comparing samples collected from two distinct compartments (infection site and blood), obtained from COVID-19 subjects and healthy controls.

MethodsWe used two publicly available gene expression datasets generated via RNA sequencing in two different samples; nasopharyngeal swabs and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). We performed a differential gene expression analysis between COVID-19 subjects and healthy controls in the two datasets and then functionally profiled their differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The genes involved in innate immunity were also determined.

ResultsWe found a clear difference in the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection between the two sample groups. In COVID-19 subjects, the nasopharyngeal sample group indicated upregulation of genes involved in cytokine activity and interferon signalling pathway, as well as downregulation of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation and viral transcription. Host response in COVID-19 subjects for the PBMC group, involved upregulation of genes involved in the complement system and immunoglobulin mediated immune response. CXCL13, GABRE, IFITM3 were upregulated and HSPA1B was downregulated in COVID-19 subjects in both sample groups.

ConclusionOur results indicate the host response to SARS-CoV-2 is compartmentalized and suggests potential biomarkers of response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Recently, the cryo-EM structure in complex with 40S ribosome is deciphered. However, the structure of full length NSP1 without any partner has not been studies. Also, the conformation of NSP1-C terminal region in isolation is not been studied. In this study, we have investigated the conformational dynamics of NSP1C-terminal region (NSP1-CTR; amino acids 130-180) in isolation and under different solvent environments. The NSP1-CTR is found to be intrinsically disordered in aqueous solution. Further, we used alpha helix inducer, trifluoroethanol, and found induction of alpha helical conformation using CD spectroscopy. Additionally, in the presence of SDS, NSP1-CTR is showing a conformational change from disordered to ordered, possibly gaining alpha helix in part. But in presence of neutral lipid DOPC, a slight change in conformation is observed. This implies the possible role of hydrophobic interaction and electrostatic interaction on the conformational changes of NSP1. The changes in structural conformation were further studied by fluorescence-based studies, which showed significant blue shift and fluorescence quenching in the presence of SDS and TFE. Lipid vesicles also showed fluorescence-based quenching. In agreement to these result, fluorescence lifetime and fluorescence anisotropy decay suggests a change in conformational dynamics. The zeta potential studies further validated that the conformational dynamics is mostly because of hydrophobic interaction. In last, these experimental studies were complemented through Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation which have also shown a good correlation and testify our experiments.

The key to understanding SARS-CoV-2s higher infectivity may lie in its host receptor recognition mechanism. This is because experiments show that the human ACE2 protein, which serves as the primary receptor for both CoVs, binds to CoV-2s spike protein 5-20 fold stronger than SARS-CoVs spike protein. The molecular basis for this difference in binding affinity, however, remains unexplained and, in fact, a comparison of X-ray structures leads to an opposite proposition. To gain insight, we use all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. Free energy calculations indicate that CoV-2s higher affinity is due primarily to differences in specific spike residues that are local to the spike-ACE2 interface, although there are allosteric effects in binding. Comparative analysis of equilibrium simulations reveals that while both CoV and CoV-2 spike-ACE2 complexes have similar interfacial topologies, CoV-2s spike protein engages in greater numbers, combinatorics and probabilities of hydrogen bonds and salt bridges with ACE2. We attribute CoV-2s higher affinity to these differences in polar contacts, and these findings also highlight the importance of thermal structural fluctuations in spike-ACE2 complexation.

To identify their genetic similarity, phylogenetic analysis was performed by comparing the worldwide SARS-CoV-2 sequences, selected from GISAID, to the complete genomes from Turkish isolates. In addition, we focused on the variation analysis to show the mutations on SARS-CoV-2 genomes.

MethodsIllumina MiSeq platform was used for sequencing the libraries. The raw reads were aligned to the known SARS-CoV-2 genome (GenBank: MN908947.3) using the Burrows-Wheeler aligner (v.0.7.1). The phylogenetic tree was constructer using Phylip v.3.6 with Neighbor-Joining and composite likelihood method. The variants were detected by using Genome Analysis Toolkit-HaplotypeCaller v.3.8.0 and were inspected on GenomeBrowse v2.1.2.

ResultsAll viral genome sequences of our isolates was located in lineage B under the different clusters such as B.1 (n=3), B.1.1 (n=28), and B.1.9 (n=16). According to the GISAID nomenclature, all our complete genomes were placed in G, GR and GH clades. Five hundred forty-nine total and 53 unique variants were detected. All 47 genomes exhibited different kinds of variants. The distinct variants consist of 274 missense, 225 synonymous, and 50 non-coding alleles.

ConclusionThe results indicated that the SARS-CoV-2 sequences of our isolates have great similarity with all Turkish and European sequences. Further studies should be performed for better comparison of strains, after more complete genome sequences will be released. We also believe that collecting and sharing any data about SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID-19 will be effective and may help the related studies.",1,384,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.11.293183v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.11.293183v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2020.09.11.293183.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

The most definitive approach to identify the intermediate host would be the detection of SARS-CoV-2-like coronaviruses in wild animals. However, due to the high number of animal species, it is not feasible to screen all the species in the laboratory. Given that the recognition of the binding ACE2 proteins is the first step for the coronaviruses to invade host cells, we proposed a computational pipeline to identify potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 by modeling the binding affinity between the Spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) and host ACE2. Using this pipeline, we systematically examined 285 ACE2 variants from mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians, and found that the binding energies calculated on the modeled Spike-RBD/ACE2 complex structures correlate closely with the effectiveness of animal infections as determined by multiple experimental datasets. Built on the optimized binding affinity cutoff, we suggested a set of 96 mammals, including 48 experimentally investigated ones, which are permissive to SARS-CoV-2, with candidates from primates, rodents, and carnivores at the highest risk of infection. Overall, this work not only suggested a limited range of potential intermediate SARS-CoV-2 hosts for further experimental investigation; but more importantly, it proposed a new structure-based approach to general zoonotic origin and susceptibility analyses that are critical for human infectious disease control and wildlife protection.",1,382,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.11.293449v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.11.293449v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2020.09.11.293449.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

We found divergent immunological responses in the CNS compartment, including increased levels of IL-12 and IL-12-associated innate and adaptive immune cell activation. Moreover, we found increased proportions of B cells in the CSF relative to the periphery and evidence of clonal expansion of CSF B cells, suggesting a divergent intrathecal humoral response to SARS-CoV-2. Indeed, all COVID-19 cases examined had anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in the CSF whose target epitopes diverged from serum antibodies. We directly examined whether CSF resident antibodies target self-antigens and found a significant burden of CNS autoimmunity, with the CSF from most patients recognizing neural self-antigens. Finally, we produced a panel of monoclonal antibodies from patients CSF and show that these target both anti-viral and anti-neural antigens--including one mAb specific for the spike protein that also recognizes neural tissue.

However, partner proteins that elucidate PKP2 cellular mechanism to understand cardiac dysfunction in ACM are mostly unknown. Here we identify the actin-based motor proteins Myh9 and Myh10 as key PKP2 interactors, and demonstrate that the expression of the ACM-related PKP2 mutant R735X alters actin fiber organization and cell mechanical stiffness. We also show that SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 protein acts similarly to this known pathogenic R735X mutant, altering the actomyosin component distribution on cardiac cells. Our data reveal that the viral Nsp1 hijacks PKP2 into the cytoplasm and mimics the effect of delocalized R735X mutant. These results demonstrate that cytoplasmic PKP2, wildtype or mutant, induces the collapse of the actomyosin network, since shRNA-PKP2 knockdown maintains the cell structure, validating a critical role of PKP2 localization in the regulation of actomyosin architecture. The fact that Nsp1 and PKP2 mutant R735X share similar phenotypes also suggests that direct SARS-CoV-2 heart infection could induce a transient ACM-like disease in COVID-19 patients, which may contribute to right ventricle dysfunction, observed in patients with poor survival prognosis.

HighlightsThe specific cardiac isoform Plakophilin-2a (PKP2) interacts with Myh9 and Myh10.

Despite over 29 million reported cases and over 900, 000 deaths worldwide as of September 2020, herd immunity and widespread vaccination efforts by many experts are expected to be insufficient in addressing this crisis for the foreseeable future. Thus, there is an urgent need for treatments that can lessen the effects of SARS-CoV-2 in patients who become seriously affected. Many viruses including HIV, the common cold, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use a unique mechanism known as -1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (-1 PRF) to successfully replicate and infect cells in the human host. SARS-CoV (the coronavirus responsible for SARS) and SARS-CoV-2 possess a unique RNA structure, a three-stemmed pseudoknot, that stimulates -1 PRF. Recent experiments identified that small molecules can be introduced as antiviral agents to bind with the pseudoknot and disrupt its stimulation of -1 PRF. If successfully developed, small molecule therapy that targets -1 PRF in SARS-CoV-2 is an excellent strategy to improve patients prognoses. Crucial to developing these successful therapies is modeling the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 -1 PRF pseudoknot. Following a structural alignment approach, we identify similarities in the -1 PRF pseudoknots of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the original SARS-CoV, as well as a third coronavirus: MERS-CoV, the coronavirus responsible for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). In addition, we provide a better understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 -1 PRF pseudoknot by comprehensively investigating the structural landscape using a hierarchical folding approach. Since understanding the impact of mutations is vital to long-term success of treatments that are based on predicted RNA functional structures, we provide insight on SARS-CoV-2 -1 PRF pseudoknot sequence mutations and their effect on the resulting structure and its function.",1,320,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.15.298604v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.15.298604v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2020.09.15.298604.txt,0,NA,1,NA,8 supplementary material an online supplement to this article can be found by visiting our github repository at https://github.com/ hosnajabbari/frameshifting.

Here, we study proteolytic cleavage of viral and cellular proteins in two cell line models of SARS-CoV-2 replication using mass spectrometry to identify protein neo-N-termini generated through protease activity. We identify previously unknown cleavage sites in multiple viral proteins, including major antigenic proteins S and N, which are the main targets for vaccine and antibody testing efforts. We discovered significant increases in cellular cleavage events consistent with cleavage by SARS-CoV-2 main protease, and identify 14 potential high-confidence substrates of the main and papain-like proteases, validating a subset with in vitro assays. We showed that siRNA depletion of these cellular proteins inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication, and that drugs targeting two of these proteins: the tyrosine kinase SRC and Ser/Thr kinase MYLK, showed a dose-dependent reduction in SARS-CoV-2 titres.

Although numerous drug and vaccine developments efforts are underway, many questions remain outstanding on the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 viral association to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), its main host receptor, and entry in the cell. Structural and biophysical studies indicate some degree of flexibility in the viral extracellular Spike glycoprotein and at the receptor binding domain-receptor interface, suggesting a role in infection. Here, we perform all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the glycosylated, full-length membrane-bound ACE2 receptor, in both an apo and spike receptor binding domain (RBD) bound state, in order to probe the intrinsic dynamics of the ACE2 receptor in the context of the cell surface. A large degree of fluctuation in the full length structure is observed, indicating hinge bending motions at the linker region connecting the head to the transmembrane helix, while still not disrupting the ACE2 homodimer or ACE2-RBD interfaces. This flexibility translates into an ensemble of ACE2 homodimer conformations that could sterically accommodate binding of the spike trimer to more than one ACE2 homodimer, and suggests a mechanical contribution of the host receptor towards the large spike conformational changes required for cell fusion. This work presents further structural and functional insights into the role of ACE2 in viral infection that can be exploited for the rational design of effective SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics.

Statement of SignificanceAs the host receptor of SARS-CoV-2, ACE2 has been the subject of extensive structural and antibody design efforts in aims to curtail COVID-19 spread. Here, we perform molecular dynamics simulations of the homodimer ACE2 full-length structure to study the dynamics of this protein in the context of the cellular membrane. The simulations evidence exceptional plasticity in the protein structure due to flexible hinge motions in the head-transmembrane domain linker region and helix mobility in the membrane, resulting in a varied ensemble of conformations distinct from the experimental structures.

Here, we report a bipartite mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 which operates by: (1) hijacking the host ribosome via direct interaction of its C-terminal domain (CT) with the 40S ribosomal subunit and (2) specifically lifting this inhibition for SARS-CoV-2 via a direct interaction of its N-terminal domain (NT) with the 5 untranslated region (5 UTR) of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA. We show that while Nsp1-CT is sufficient for binding to 40S and inhibition of host protein translation, the 5 UTR of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA removes this inhibition by binding to Nsp1-NT, suggesting that the Nsp1-NT-UTR interaction is incompatible with the Nsp1-CT-40S interaction. Indeed, lengthening the linker between Nsp1-NT and Nsp1-CT of Nsp1 progressively reduced the ability of SARS-CoV-2 5 UTR to escape the translational inhibition, supporting that the incompatibility is likely steric in nature. The short SL1 region of the 5 UTR is required for viral mRNA translation in the presence of Nsp1. Thus, our data provide a comprehensive view on how Nsp1 switches infected cells from host mRNA translation to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA translation, and that Nsp1 and 5 UTR may be targeted for anti-COVID-19 therapeutics.",1,277,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.18.302901v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.18.302901v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2020.09.18.302901.txt,1,"field-specific repository, data availability statement",0,data availability the cryo-em maps included in this study have been deposited in the electron microscopy data bank with the accession code emd-22681.;     the atomic coordinates have been deposited in the protein data bank with the accession code 7k5i.      data availability the cryo-em maps included in this study have been deposited in the electron microscopy data bank with the accession code emd-22681,NA

The evolutionary conservation and its occurrence in all viral subgenomic transcripts implicates a key role of s2m in the viral infection cycle. Our findings indicate that the element, while stably folded, can nonetheless be invaded and remodelled spontaneously by antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) that initiate pairing in exposed loops and trigger efficient sequence-specific RNA cleavage in reporter assays. ASOs also act to inhibit replication in an astrovirus replicon model system in a sequence-specific, dose-dependent manner and inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection in cell culture.

Here we present for the first time that SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and GX_P2V could infect lung progenitor and even anterior foregut endoderm cells causing these cells death, which differentiated from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). The infection and replication of SARS-CoV-2 and GX_P2V were inhibited when treated with whey protein of breastmilk and Remdesivir, confirming that these two viruses could infect lung progenitor and even anterior foregut endoderm. Moreover, we found that SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus could infect endoderm and ectoderm. We found that whey protein blocked SARS-CoV-2 infecting these cells. In line with the SARS-CoV-2 results, GX_P2V could also infected endoderm and ectoderm, and also was inhibited by Remdesivir treatment. Although expressing coronavirus related receptor such as ACE2 and TMPRSS2, mesoderm cells are not permissive for SARS-CoV-2 and GX_P2V infection, which needed further to study the mechanisms. Interestingly, we also found that hESCs, which also express ACE2 and TMPRSS2 markers, are permissive for GX_P2V but not SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection and replication, indicating the widespread cell types for GX_P2V infection. Heparin treatment blocked efficiently viral infection. These results provided insight that these stem cells maybe provided a stable repository of coronavirus function or genome.

However, because the viral phylogeny is already so large - and will undoubtedly grow many fold - placing new sequences onto the tree has emerged as a barrier to real-time genomic contact tracing. Here, we resolve this challenge by building an efficient, tree-based data structure encoding the inferred evolutionary history of the virus. We demonstrate that our approach improves the speed of phylogenetic placement of new samples and data visualization by orders of magnitude, making it possible to complete the placements under real-time constraints. Our method also provides the key ingredient for maintaining a fully-updated reference phylogeny. We make these tools available to the research community through the UCSC SARS-CoV-2 Genome Browser to enable rapid cross-referencing of information in new virus sequences with an ever-expanding array of molecular and structural biology data. The methods described here will empower research and genomic contact tracing for laboratories worldwide.

It was reported that HCQ induced psychiatric symptoms in a few patients with autoimmune diseases, but it is still uncertain whether HCQ poses a risk to mental health. Therefore, in this study, we treated healthy mice with two different doses of HCQ that are comparable to clinically administered doses for 7 days. Psychiatric-like behaviors and the expression of related molecules in the brain were evaluated at two time points, i.e., 24 h and 10 days after drug administration. We found that HCQ increased anxiety behavior at both 24 h and 10 days and enhanced depressive behavior at 24 h. Furthermore, HCQ decreased the mRNA expression of interleukin-1beta and corticotropin-releasing hormone (Crh) in the hippocampus and decreased the mRNA expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) in both the hippocampus and amygdala. Most of these behavioral and molecular changes were sustained beyond 10 days after drug administration, and some of them were dose-dependent. Although this animal study does not prove that HCQ has a similar effect in humans, it indicates that HCQ poses a significant risk to mental health and suggests that further clinical investigation is essential.

To study the dynamic motion of glycans in the spike protein, we performed microsecond-long MD simulation in two different states that correspond to the receptor binding domain in open or closed conformations. Analysis of this microsecond-long simulation revealed a scissoring motion on the N-terminal domain of neighboring monomers in the spike trimer. Role of multiple glycans in shielding of spike protein in different regions were uncovered by a network analysis, where the high betweenness centrality of glycans at the apex revealed their importance and function in the glycan shield. Microdomains of glycans were identified featuring a high degree of intra-communication in these microdomains.

Development of innovative direct-acting antiviral agents is sorely needed to address this virus. Peptide-conjugated morpholino oligomers (PPMO) are antisense agents composed of a phosphordiamidate morpholino oligomer covalently conjugated to a cell-penetrating peptide. PPMO require no delivery assistance to enter cells and are able to reduce expression of targeted RNA through sequence-specific steric blocking.

Objectives and MethodsFive PPMO designed against sequences of genomic RNA in the SARS-CoV-2 5-untranslated region and a negative control PPMO of random sequence were synthesized. Each PPMO was evaluated for its effect on the viability of uninfected cells and its inhibitory effect on the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero-E6 cell cultures. Cell viability was evaluated with an ATP-based method and viral growth was measured with quantitative RT-PCR and TCID50 infectivity assays.

ResultsPPMO designed to base-pair with sequence in the 5-terminal region or the leader transcription regulatory sequence-region of SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA were highly efficacious, reducing viral titers by up to 4-6 log10 in cell cultures at 48-72 hours post-infection, in a non-toxic and dose-responsive manner.

Using an image-based high-content screen, we identified two thiopurines, 6-thioguanine (6-TG) and 6-thioguanosine (6-TGo), that selectively disrupted the processing and accumulation of IAV glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). Selective disruption of IAV glycoprotein processing and accumulation by 6-TG and 6-TGo correlated with unfolded protein response (UPR) activation and HA accumulation could be partially restored by the chemical chaperone 4-phenylbutyrate (4PBA). Chemical inhibition of the integrated stress response (ISR) restored accumulation of NA monomers in the presence of 6-TG or 6-TGo, but did not restore NA glycosylation or oligomerization. Thiopurines inhibited replication of the human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), which also correlated with UPR/ISR activation and diminished accumulation of ORF1ab and nucleocapsid (N) mRNAs and N protein, which suggests broader disruption of coronavirus gene expression in ER-derived cytoplasmic compartments. The chemically similar thiopurine 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) had little effect on the UPR and did not affect IAV or HCoV-OC43 replication. Consistent with reports on other CoV Spike (S) proteins, ectopic expression of SARS-CoV-2 S protein caused UPR activation. 6-TG treatment inhibited accumulation of full length S0 or furin-cleaved S2 fusion proteins, but spared the S1 ectodomain. DBeQ, which inhibits the p97 AAA-ATPase required for retrotranslocation of ubiquitinated misfolded proteins during ER-associated degradation (ERAD) restored accumulation of S0 and S2 proteins in the presence of 6-TG, suggesting that 6-TG induced UPR accelerates ERAD-mediated turnover of membrane-anchored S0 and S2 glycoproteins. Taken together, these data indicate that 6-TG and 6-TGo are effective host-targeted antivirals that trigger the UPR and disrupt accumulation of viral glycoproteins. Importantly, our data demonstrate for the first time the efficacy of these thiopurines in limiting IAV and HCoV-OC43 replication in cell culture models.

IMPORTANCESecreted and transmembrane proteins are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where they are folded and modified prior to transport. During infection, many viruses burden the ER with the task of creating and processing viral glycoproteins that will ultimately be incorporated into viral envelopes. Some viruses refashion the ER into replication compartments where viral gene expression and genome replication take place. This viral burden on the ER can trigger the cellular unfolded protein response (UPR), which attempts to increase the protein folding and processing capacity of the ER to match the protein load. Much remains to be learned about how viruses co-opt the UPR to ensure efficient synthesis of viral glycoproteins. Here, we show that two FDA-approved thiopurine drugs, 6-TG and 6-TGo, induce the UPR in a manner that impedes viral glycoprotein accumulation for enveloped influenza viruses and coronaviruses. These drugs may impede the replication of viruses that require precise tuning of the UPR to support viral glycoprotein synthesis for the successful completion of a replication cycle.",1,328,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.30.319863v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.30.319863v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2020.09.30.319863.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

In June 2020, all African countries registered human infections with SARS-CoV-2.

The virus is mutating steadily and this is monitored by a well curated database of viral nucleotide sequences from samples taken from infected individual thus enabling phylogenetic analysis and phenotypic associations.

MethodsWe downloaded from the GISAID database, SARS-CoV-2 sequences established from four West African countries Ghana, Gambia, Senegal and Nigeria and then performed phylogenetic analysis employing the nextstrain pipeline. Based on mutations found within the sequences we calculated and visualized statistics characterizing clades according to the GISAID nomenclature.

ResultsWe found country-specific patterns of viral clades: the later Europe-associated G-clades predominantly in Senegal and Gambia, and combinations of the earlier (L, S, V) and later clades in Ghana and Nigeria. Contrary to our expectations, the later Europe-associated G-clades emerged before the earlier clades. Detailed analysis of distinct samples showed that some of the earlier clades might have circulated latently and some reflect migration routes via Mali and Tunisia.

ConclusionsThe distinct patterns of viral clades in the West African countries point at its emergence from Europe and China via Asia and Europe. The observation that the later clades emerged before the earlier clades could be simply due to founder effects or due to latent circulation of the earlier clades. Only a marginal correlation of the G-clades associated with the D614G mutation could be identified with the relatively low case fatality (0.6-3.2).

Although SARS-CoV-2 propagates efficiently in African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells, antivirals such as nucleos(t)ide analogs (nucs) often exhibit decreased activity in these cells due to inefficient metabolization. Limited SARS-CoV-2 replication and propagation occurs in human cells, which are the most relevant testing platforms. By performing serial passages of a SARS-CoV-2 isolate in the human hepatoma cell line clone Huh7.5, we selected viral populations with improved viability in human cells. Culture adaptation led to the emergence of a significant number of high frequency changes (>90% of the viral population) in the region coding for the spike glycoprotein, including a deletion of nine amino acids in the N-terminal domain and 3 amino acid changes (E484D, P812R, and Q954H). We demonstrated that the Huh7.5-adapted virus exhibited a >3-Log10 increase in infectivity titers (TCID50) in Huh7.5 cells, with titers of ~8 Log10TCID50/mL, and >2-Log10 increase in the human lung cancer cell line Calu-1, with titers of ~6 Log10TCID50/mL. Culture adaptation in Huh7.5 cells further permitted efficient infection of the otherwise SARS-CoV-2 refractory human lung cancer cell line A549, with titers of ~6 Log10TCID50/mL. The enhanced ability of the virus to replicate and propagate in human cells permitted screening of a panel of nine nucs, including broad-spectrum compounds. Remdesivir, EIDD-2801 and to a limited extent galidesivir showed antiviral effect across these human cell lines, whereas sofosbuvir, uprifosbuvir, valopicitabine, mericitabine, ribavirin, and favipiravir had no apparent activity.

ImportanceThe cell culture adapted variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus obtained in the present study, showed significantly enhanced replication and propagation in various human cell lines, including lung derived cells otherwise refractory for infection with the original virus. This SARS-CoV-2 variant will be a valuable tool permitting investigations across human cell types, and studies of identified mutations could contribute to our understanding of viral pathogenesis. In particular, the adapted virus can be a good model for investigations of viral entry and cell tropism for SARS-CoV-2, in which the spike glycoprotein plays a central role. Further, as shown here with the use of remdesivir and EIDD-2801, two nucs with significant inhibitory effect against SARS-CoV-2, large differences in the antiviral activity are observed depending on the cell line. Thus, it is essential to select the most relevant target cells for pre-clinical screenings of antiviral compounds, facilitated by using a virus with broader tropism.",1,313,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.04.325316v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.04.325316v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2020.10.04.325316.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Severe and not mild infection correlated with high titers of IgG against Spike receptor binding domain (RBD) that were capable of viral inhibition. B cell receptor (BCR) sequencing revealed two VH genes, VH3-38 and VH3-53, that were enriched during severe infection.

Interestingly, coronaviruses were found to subvert and hijack the autophagic process to allow their viral replication. One of the spotlights had been focused on the autophagy inhibitors as a target mechanism effective in the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Consequently, chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), a derivative of CQ, was suggested as the first potentially be therapeutic strategies as they are known to be autophagy inhibitors. Then, they were used as therapeutics in SARS-CoV-2 infection along with remdesivir, for which the FDA approved emergency use authorization. Here, we investigated the antiviral activity and associated mechanism of GNS561, a small basic lipophilic molecule inhibitor of late-stage autophagy, against SARS-CoV-2. Our data indicated that GNS561 showed the highest antiviral effect for two SARS-CoV-2 strains compared to CQ and remdesivir. Focusing on the autophagy mechanism, we showed that GNS561, located in LAMP2-positive lysosomes, together with SARS-CoV-2, blocked autophagy by increasing the size of LC3-II spots and the accumulation of autophagic vacuoles in the cytoplasm with the presence of multilamellar bodies characteristic of a complexed autophagy. Finally, our study revealed that the combination of GNS561 and remdesivir was associated with a strong synergistic antiviral effect against SARS-CoV-2.

Here, we have used a well-established nuclear export assay to experimentally establish whether the recently proposed nucleocapsid NESs are capable of mediating nuclear export, and to evaluate if their activity correlates with coronavirus pathogenicity.

The six NES motifs tested were functional in our assay, but displayed wide differences in export activity. Importantly, these differences in NES strength were not related to strain pathogenicity. Rather, we found that the NESs of the strains belonging to the genus Alphacoronavirus were markedly stronger than the NESs of the strains belonging to the genus Betacoronavirus.

We conclude that, while some of the genomic features recently identified in silico could be crucial contributors to coronavirus pathogenicity, this does not appear to be the case of nucleocapsid NES activity, as it is more closely related to coronavirus genus than to pathogenic capacity.",1,302,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.06.328138v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.06.328138v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2020.10.06.328138.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

We identified an absolute requirement for the VTT-domain containing protein TMEM41B for infection by SARS-CoV-2 and all other coronaviruses. This human Coronaviridae host factor compendium represents a rich resource to develop new therapeutic strategies for acute COVID-19 and potential future coronavirus spillover events.

HIGHLIGHTSGenome-wide CRISPR screens for SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-229E coronavirus host factors.

Parallel genome-wide CRISPR screening uncovered host factors and pathways with pan-coronavirus and virus-specific functional roles.

Coronaviruses co-opt multiple biological pathways, including glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis, SREBP signaling, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol biosynthesis and anchoring, among others.

In the current educational landscape, programs that meet these competencies are offered and attended in an ad hoc manner. During the COVID-19 pandemic and the accompanying switch to virtual learning, our team observed a surge in interest for our weekly non-sequential programs. In this study, we surveyed our learners to better understand motivators for attending these programs during the pandemic and to identify barriers for participating in such events before and during Work-From-Home. Our data indicate that conflict with research responsibilities, time spent to get to the event location, and planning time to attend are all significant barriers to engagement. Notably, feelings of being overwhelmed, which increased slightly during the pandemic, stood out as an identified barrier. Per our results, the virtual format was an attraction. While 58% of respondents would prefer to access professional development programs virtually in the future, almost 42% indicated a preference for in-person events when normalcy resumes as the physical presence of an instructor and of peers result in a deeper engagement. Our collective analysis here suggests that learners will benefit from a hybrid or combination of synchronous and asynchronous career and professional development programming in the future, even post-pandemic, to reduce identified barriers.

However, the enhancement of computational power, the demand for adaptable predictive frameworks, the short past of the disease, and uncertainties related to input data and prediction rules, also make other classical and machine learning techniques viable options.

OBJECTIVEThis study investigates the efficiency of six models in forecasting COVID-19 confirmed cases with 17 days ahead. We compare the models autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), Holt-Winters, support vector regression (SVR), k-nearest neighbors regressor (KNN), random trees regressor (RTR), seasonal linear regression with change-points (Prophet), and simple logistic regression (SLR).

MATERIAL AND METHODSWe implement the models to data provided by the health surveillance secretary of Amapaa, a Brazilian state fully carved in the Amazon rainforest, which has been experiencing high infection rates. We evaluate the models according to their capacity to forecast in different historical scenarios of the COVID-19 progression, such as exponential increases, sudden decreases, and stability periods of daily cases. To do so, we use a rolling forward splitting approach for out-of-sample validation. We employ the metrics RMSE, R-squared, and sMAPE in evaluating the model in different cross-validation sections.

FINDINGSAll models outperform SLG, especially Holt-Winters, that performs satisfactorily in all scenarios. SVR and ARIMA have better performances in isolated scenarios. To implement the comparisons, we have created a web application, which is available online.

CONCLUSIONThis work represents an effort to assist the decision-makers of Amapa in future decisions to come, especially under scenarios of sudden variations in the number of confirmed cases of Amapa, which would be caused, for instance, by new contamination waves or vaccination. It is also an attempt to highlight alternative models that could be used in future epidemics.",1,419,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.09.332908v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.09.332908v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2020.10.09.332908.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Our mechanistic studies on TMEM41B revealed that all members of the Flaviviridae family that we tested require TMEM41B.

Informal accounts of anecdotal use of chlorine dioxide (ClO2), a well-known disinfectant and antiseptic, in COVID-19 patients has raised concern about potential toxicity, but also raises the question that ClO2 might elicit antiviral effects, a possibility that has never been examined in vivo in any animal model. Here, we challenged the hypothesis that ClO2 decreases the viral load and virus-induced mortality in a vertebrate model. For this, we determined viral load, virus-induced lesions and mortality in 10-day old chick embryos inoculated with 104 mean EID50/mL of attenuated Massachusetts and Connecticut avian coronavirus (IBV) strains.

ResultsThe ClO2 treatment had a marked impact on IBV infection. Namely, viral titres were 2.4-fold lower and mortality was reduced by half in infected embryos that were treated with ClO2. Infection led to developmental abnormalities regardless of treatment. Lesions typical of IBV infections were observed in all inoculated embryos, but severity tended to be significantly lower in ClO2-treated embryos. We found no gross or microscopic evidence of toxicity caused by ClO2 at the doses used herein.

ConclusionsOur study shows that ClO2 could be a safe and viable way of treating and mitigating the effects of avian coronavirus infections, and raises the possibility that similar effects could be observed in other organisms.

Mechanistic analyses show that autophagy and type I IFN responses are effectively counteracted at different levels. For example, Nsp14 induces loss of the IFN receptor, whereas ORF3a disturbs autophagy at the Golgi/endosome interface. Comparative analyses revealed that antagonism of type I IFN and autophagy is largely conserved, except that SARS-CoV-1 Nsp15 is more potent in counteracting type I IFN than its SARS-CoV-2 ortholog. Altogether, however, SARS-CoV-2 counteracts type I IFN responses and autophagy much more efficiently than type II and III IFN signaling. Consequently, the virus is relatively resistant against exogenous IFN-/{beta} and autophagy modulation but remains highly vulnerable towards IFN-{gamma} and -{lambda} treatment. In combination, IFN-{gamma} and -{lambda} act synergistically, and drastically reduce SARS-CoV-2 replication at exceedingly low doses.

Both viruses caused a robust productive respiratory tract infection resulting in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to two of four indirect recipient ferrets and SARS-CoV to all four. A control pandemic A/H1N1 influenza virus also transmitted efficiently. Serological assays confirmed all virus transmission events.

We produced a recombinant N-terminal fraction of the Spike SARS-CoV-2 protein and injected it into adult female zebrafish.

Despite the evidence about SARS-CoV-2 infecting the human gut, little is known about the importance of the enteric phase of SARS-CoV-2 for the viral lifecycle and for the development of COVID-19-associated pathologies. Similarly, it remains unknown whether the innate immune response triggered in this organ to combat viral infection is similar or distinct compared to the one triggered in other organs.

DesignWe exploited human ileum- and colon-derived organoids as a non-transformed culture model supporting SARS-CoV-2 infection. We characterized the replication kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 in intestinal epithelial cells and correlated the expression of the viral receptor ACE2 with infection. We performed conventional and targeted single-cell transcriptomics and multiplex single-molecule RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization and used IFN-reporter bioassays to characterize the response of primary human intestinal epithelial cells to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

ResultsWe identified a subpopulation of enterocytes as the prime target of SARS-CoV-2. We found the lack of positive correlation between susceptibility to infection and the expression of ACE2 and revealed that SARS-CoV-2 downregulates ACE2 expression upon infection. Infected cells activated strong proinflammatory programs and produced interferon, while expression of interferon-stimulated genes was limited to bystander cells due to SARS-CoV-2 suppressing the autocrine action of interferon in infected cells.

ConclusionOur findings reveal that SARS-CoV-2 curtails the immune response in primary human intestinal epithelial cells to promote its replication and spread and this highlights the gut as a proinflammatory reservoir that should be considered to fully understand SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.

Significance of the studyWhat is already known about this subject? O_LICOVID-19 patients have gastrointestinal symptoms which likely correlates with SARS-CoV-2 infection of the intestinal epithelium

What are the new findings? O_LIA specific subpopulation of enterocytes are the prime targets of SARS-CoV-2 infection of the human gut.
C_LIO_LIThere is a lack of correlation between ACE2 expression and susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2 downregulates ACE2 expression upon infection.
C_LIO_LIHuman intestinal epithelium cells produce interferon upon SARS-CoV-2 infection.
C_LIO_LIInterferon acts in a paracrine manner to induce interferon stimulated genes that control viral infection only in bystander cells.
C_LIO_LISARS-CoV-2 actively blocks interferon signaling in infected cells.
C_LI

How might it impact on clinical practice in the foreseeable future? O_LIThe absence of correlation between ACE2 levels and susceptibility suggest that medications influencing ACE2 levels (e.g. high blood pressure drugs) will not make patients more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
C_LIO_LIThe restricted cell tropism and the distinct immune response mounted by the GI tract, suggests that specific cellular restriction/replication factors and organ specific intrinsic innate immune pathways can represent unique therapeutic targets to treat COVD-19 patients by considering which organ is most infected/impacted by SARS-CoV-2.
C_LIO_LIThe strong pro-inflammatory signal mounted by the intestinal epithelium can fuel the systemic inflammation observed in COVID-19 patients and is likely participating in the lung specific pathology.

This arises, in part, from SARS-CoV-2 infection of the cortical brain vasculature, meninges, and choroid plexus, stimulating increased inflammatory signaling into the brain. In parallel, peripheral immune cells infiltrate the brain, microglia activate programs mediating the phagocytosis of live neurons, and astrocytes dysregulate genes involved in neurotransmitter homeostasis.

In the fields of epidemiology and macroevolution these models can be used to estimate, respectively, the past number of infected individuals (prevalence) or the past number of species (paleodiversity) through time. Recent years have seen the development of ""total-evidence"" analyses, which combine molecular and morphological data from extant and past sampled individuals in a unified Bayesian inference framework. Even sampled individuals characterized only by their sampling time, i.e. lacking morphological and molecular data, which we call occurrences, provide invaluable information to reconstruct past population sizes.

Here, we present new methodological developments around the Fossilized Birth-Death Process enabling us to (i) efficiently incorporate occurrence data while remaining computationally tractable and scalable; (ii) consider piecewise-constant birth, death and sampling rates; and (iii) reconstruct past population sizes, with or without knowledge of the underlying tree. We implement our method in the RevBayes software environment, enabling its use along with a large set of models of molecular and morphological evolution, and validate the inference workflow using simulations under a wide range of conditions.

We finally illustrate our new implementation using two empirical datasets stemming from the fields of epidemiology and macroevolution. In epidemiology, we apply our model to the Covid-19 outbreak on the Diamond Princess ship. We infer the total prevalence throughout the outbreak, by taking into account jointly the case count record (occurrences) along with viral sequences for a fraction of infected individuals. In macroevolution, we present an empirical case study of cetaceans.

Inactivated virus formulated vaccines such as Hepatitis A, oral polio vaccine, and smallpox proved to be reliable approaches for immunization for prolonged periods.

In this study, an inactivated virus vaccine that includes a gamma irradiation process for the inactivation as an alternative to classical chemical inactivation methods so that there is no extra purification required has been optimized. The vaccine candidate (OZG-38.61.3) was then applied in mice by employing the intradermal route, which decreased the requirement of a higher concentration of inactivated virus for proper immunization, unlike most of the classical inactivated vaccine treatments.

Here we use synthetic RNA chemistry, biochemistry and cryo-electron microscopy to establish the molecular mechanism of remdesivir-induced RdRp stalling. We show that addition of the fourth nucleotide following remdesivir incorporation into the RNA product is impaired by a barrier to further RNA translocation. This translocation barrier causes retention of the RNA 3-nucleotide in the substrate-binding site of the RdRp and interferes with entry of the next nucleoside triphosphate, thereby stalling RdRp. In the structure of the remdesivir-stalled state, the 3-nucleotide of the RNA product is matched with the template base, and this may prevent proofreading by the viral 3-exonuclease that recognizes mismatches9,10.

Increasing evidence shows that both natural and synthetic antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), also referred to as Host Defense Proteins/Peptides (HDPs), can inhibit SARS-CoV-2, paving the way for the potential clinical use of these molecules as therapeutic options. In this manuscript, we describe the potent antiviral activity exerted by brilacidin--a de novo designed synthetic small molecule that captures the biological properties of HDPs--on SARS-CoV-2 in a human lung cell line (Calu-3) and a monkey cell line (Vero). These data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 inhibition in these cell culture models is primarily a result of the impact of brilacidin on viral entry and its disruption of viral integrity. Brilacidin has demonstrated synergistic antiviral activity when combined with remdesivir. Collectively, our data demonstrate that brilacidin exerts potent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 and thus supports brilacidin as a promising COVID-19 drug candidate.

Significance StatementSARS-CoV-2, the emergent novel coronavirus, has led to the current global COVID-19 pandemic, characterized by extreme contagiousness and high mortality rates. There is an urgent need for effective therapeutic strategies to safely and effectively treat SARS-CoV-2 infection. We demonstrate that brilacidin, a synthetic small molecule with peptide-like properties, is capable of exerting potent in vitro antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, both as a standalone treatment and in combination with remdesivir, which is currently the only FDA-approved drug for the treatment of COVID-19.",1,508,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.29.352450v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.29.352450v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2020.10.29.352450.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Lymphopenia and active T and B cell responses were found to coexist and associated with age, sex and their interactions with COVID-19. Diverse epithelial and immune cell types were observed to be virus-positive and showed dramatic transcriptomic changes. Elevation of ANXA1 and S100A9 in virus-positive squamous epithelial cells may enable the initiation of neutrophil and macrophage responses via the ANXA1-FPR1 and S100A8/9-TLR4 axes. Systemic upregulation of S100A8/A9, mainly by megakaryocytes and monocytes in the peripheral blood, may contribute to the cytokine storms frequently observed in severe patients. Our data provide a rich resource for understanding the pathogenesis and designing effective therapeutic strategies for COVID-19.

Rapid SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is often unavailable but could support public health organizations and hospitals in monitoring and determining transmission links. Here we report the use of reverse complement polymerase chain reaction (RC-PCR), a novel technology for WGS of SARS-CoV-2 enabling library preparation in a single PCR saving time, resources and enables high throughput screening. Additionally, we show SARS-CoV-2 diversity and possible transmission within the Radboud university medical center (Radboudumc) during September 2020 using RC-PCR WGS.

MethodsA total of 173 samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 between March and September 2020 were selected for whole-genome sequencing. Ct values of the samples ranged from 16 to 42. They were collected from 83 healthcare workers and three patients at the Radboudumc, in addition to 64 people living in the area around the hospital and tested by the local health services. For validation purposes, nineteen of the included samples were previously sequenced using Oxford Nanopore Technologies and compared to RC-PCR WGS results. The applicability of RC-PCR WGS in outbreak analysis for public health service and hospitals was tested on six suspected clusters containing samples of healthcare workers and patients with an epidemiological link.

FindingsRC-PCR resulted in sequencing data for 146 samples. It showed a genome coverage of up to 98,2% for samples with a maximum Ct value of 32. Comparison to Oxford Nanopore technologies gives a near-perfect agreement on 95% of the samples (18 out of 19). Three out of six clusters with a suspected epidemiological link were fully confirmed, in the others, four healthcare workers were not associated. In the public health service samples, a previously unknown chain of transmission was confirmed.

Significance statementSAR-CoV-2 whole-genome sequencing using RC-PCR is a reliable technique and applicable for use in outbreak analysis and surveillance. Its ease of use, high-trough screening capacity and wide applicability makes it a valuable addition or replacement during this ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSAt present whole genome sequencing techniques for SARS-CoV-2 have a large turnover time and are not widely available. Only a few laboratories are currently able to perform large scale SARS-CoV-2 sequencing. This restricts the use of sequencing to aid hospital and community infection prevention.

Added value of this studyHere we present clinical and technical data on a novel Whole Genome Sequencing technology, implementing reverse-complement PCR. It is able to obtain high genome coverage of SARS-CoV-2 and confirm and exclude epidemiological links in 173 healthcare workers and patients. The RC-PCR technology simplifies the workflow thereby reducing hands on time. It combines targeted PCR and sequence library construction in a single PCR, which normally takes several steps. Additionally, this technology can be used in concordance with the widely available range of Illumina sequencers.

Implications of all the available evidenceRC-PCR whole genome sequencing technology enables rapid and targeted surveillance and response to an ongoing outbreak that has great impact on public health and society. Increased use of sequencing technologies in local laboratories can help prevent increase of SARS-CoV-2 spreading by better understanding modes of transmission.",1,88,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.29.360578v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.29.360578v2.full.pdf,_10.1101_2020.10.29.360578.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

The underlying COVID-19 mechanisms engaged by these extra-pulmonary organ systems are largely unknown. We approached this knowledge gap by recognizing that neutral amino acid transporter B0AT1 (alternately called NBB, B, B0 in the literature) is a common denominator expressed nearly exclusively by three particular cell types: intestinal epithelia, renal proximal tubule epithelium, and cardiomyocytes. B0AT1 provides uptake of glutamine and tryptophan. The gut is the main depot expressing over 90% of the bodys entire pool of SARS-CoV-2 receptor angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) and B0AT1. Recent cryo-EM studies established that ACE2 forms a thermodynamically favored dimer-of-heterodimers complex with B0AT1 assembled in the form of a dimer of two ACE2:B0AT1 heterodimers anchored in plasma membranes. Prior epithelial cell studies demonstrated ACE2 chaperone trafficking of B0AT1. This contrasts with monomeric expression of ACE2 in lung pneumocytes, in which B0AT1 is undetectable. The cell types in question also express a disintegrin and metalloproteinase-17 (ADAM17) known to cleave and shed the ectodomain of monomeric ACE2 from the cell surface, thereby relinquishing protection against unchecked renin-angiotensin-system (RAS) events of COVID-19. The present study employed molecular docking modeling to examine the interplaying assemblage of ACE2, ADAM17 and B0AT1. We report that in the monomer form of ACE2, neck region residues R652-N718 provide unimpeded access to ADAM17 active site pocket, but notably R708 and S709 remained >10-15 [A] distant. In contrast, interference of ADAM17 docking to ACE2 in a dimer-of-heterodimers arrangement was directly correlated with the presence of a neighboring B0AT1 subunit complexed to the partnering ACE2 subunit of the 2ACE2:2B0AT1] dimer of heterodimers, representing the expression pattern putatively exclusive to intestinal, renal and cardiomyocyte cell types. The monomer and dimer-of-heterodimers docking models were not influenced by the presence of SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) complexed to ACE2. The results collectively provide the underpinnings for understanding the role of B0AT1 involvement in COVID-19 and the role of ADAM17 steering ACE2 events in intestinal and renal epithelial cells and cardiomyocytes, with implications useful for consideration in pandemic public hygiene policy and drug development.",1,509,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.30.361873v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.30.361873v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2020.10.30.361873.txt,1,field-specific repository,0,targets included pdb id: 6m17 [35] employed as a 2ace2:2b0at1 dimer-ofheterodimers complexed with sars-cov-2 receptor binding domain (rbd) and pdb:6m18 [35] employed analogously lacking sars-cov-2 rbd.,NA

Effective treatment for SARS-CoV-2 is urgently needed. We recently discovered four SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) inhibitors including boceprevir, calpain inhibitors II and XII and GC-376 with potent antiviral activity against infectious SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture. Despite the weaker enzymatic inhibition of calpain inhibitors II and XII against Mpro compared to GC-376, calpain inhibitors II and XII had more potent cellular antiviral activity. This observation promoted us to hypothesize that the cellular antiviral activity of calpain inhibitors II and XII might also involve the inhibition of cathepsin L in addition to Mpro. To test this hypothesis, we tested calpain inhibitors II and XII in the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization assay in Vero E6 cells and found that both compounds significantly decreased pseudoviral particle entry into cells, indicating their role in inhibiting cathepsin L. The involvement of cathepsin L was further confirmed in the drug time-of-addition experiment. In addition, we found that these four compounds not only inhibit SARS-CoV-2, but also SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, as well as human coronaviruses (CoVs) 229E, OC43, and NL63. The mechanism of action is through targeting the viral Mpro, which was supported by the thermal shift binding assay and enzymatic FRET assay. We further showed that these four compounds have additive antiviral effect when combined with remdesivir. Altogether, these results suggest that boceprevir, calpain inhibitors II and XII, and GC-376 are not only promising antiviral drug candidates against existing human coronaviruses, but also might work against future emerging CoVs.",1,257,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.30.362335v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.30.362335v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2020.10.30.362335.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

To investigate possible mediators of pH-dependence, pKa calculations have been made on a set of structures for spike protein ectodomain and fragments from SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses. Dominating a heat map of the aggregated predictions, 3 histidine residues in S2 are consistently predicted as destabilising in pre-fusion (all 3) and post-fusion (2 of 3) structures. Other predicted features include the more moderate energetics of surface salt-bridge interactions, and sidechain-mainchain interactions. Two aspartic acid residues in partially buried salt-bridges (D290 - R273 and R355 - D398) have pKas that are calculated to be elevated and destabilising in more open forms of the spike trimer. These aspartic acids are most stabilised in a tightly closed conformation that has been observed when linoleic acid is bound, and which also affects the interactions of D614. The D614G mutation is known to modulate the balance of closed to open trimer. It is suggested that D398 in particular contributes to a pH-dependence of the open/closed equilibrium, potentially coupled to the effects of linoleic acid binding and D614G mutation, and possibly also A570D mutation.

However, the understanding of immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 is still limited, and it is unclear how the virus protects this surface from recognition by antibodies. Here, we designed an RBD mutant that disrupts the ACE2IS and used it to characterize the prevalence of antibodies directed to the ACE2IS from convalescent sera of 94 COVID19-positive patients. We found that only a small fraction of RBD-binding antibodies targeted the ACE2IS. To assess the immunogenicity of different parts of the spike protein, we performed in vitro antibody selection for the spike and the RBD proteins using both unbiased and biased selection strategies. Intriguingly, unbiased selection yielded antibodies that predominantly targeted regions outside the ACE2IS, whereas ACE2IS-binding antibodies were readily identified from biased selection designed to enrich such antibodies. Furthermore, antibodies from an unbiased selection using the RBD preferentially bound to the surfaces that are inaccessible in the context of whole spike protein. These results suggest that the ACE2IS has evolved less immunogenic than the other regions of the spike protein, which has important implications in the development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.",1,358,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.03.365270v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.03.365270v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2020.11.03.365270.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Our aim was to design a semi-split inactivated vaccine offering a wide range of multi-epitope determinants important for the immune system including not only the spike (S) protein but also the envelope, membrane and nucleocapsid proteins. We designed a semi-split vaccine prototype consisting of S protein-depleted viral particles and free S protein. Next, we investigated its immunogenic potential in BALB/c mice. The animals were immunized intradermally or intramuscularly with the dose adjusted with buffer or addition of aluminum hydroxide, respectively. The antibody response was evaluated by plasma analysis at 7 days after the first or second dose. The immune cell response was studied by flow cytometry analysis of splenocytes. The data showed a very early onset of both S protein-specific antibodies and virus-neutralizing antibodies at 90% inhibition regardless of the route of vaccine administration. However, significantly higher levels of neutralizing antibodies were detected in the intradermally (geometric mean titer - GMT of 7.8 {+/-} 1.4) than in the intramuscularly immunized mice (GMT of 6.2 {+/-} 1.5). In accordance with this, stimulation of cellular immunity by the semi-split vaccine was suggested by elevated levels of B and T lymphocyte subpopulations in the murine spleens. These responses were more predominant in the intradermally immunized mice compared with the intramuscular route of administration. The upward trend in the levels of plasmablasts, memory B cells, Th1 and Th2 lymphocytes, including follicular helper T cells, was confirmed even in mice receiving the vaccine intradermally at a dose of 0.5 g.

We demonstrated that the semi-split vaccine is capable of eliciting both humoral and cellular immunity early after vaccination. Our prototype thus represents a promising step toward the development of an efficient anti-COVID-19 vaccine for human use.",1,364,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.03.366641v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.03.366641v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2020.11.03.366641.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Although a large number of transcriptional profiling studies have been conducted in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells, little is known regarding the translational landscape of host and viral proteins. Here, using ribosome profiling in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, we identify structural elements that regulate viral gene expression, alternative translation initiation events, as well as host responses regulated by mRNA translation. We found that the ribosome density was low within the SARS-CoV-2 frameshifting element but high immediately downstream, which suggests the utilization of a highly efficient ribosomal frameshifting strategy. In SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, although many chemokine, cytokine and interferon stimulated genes were upregulated at the mRNA level, they were not translated efficiently, suggesting a translational block that disarms host innate host responses. Together, these data reveal the key role of mRNA translation in SARS-CoV-2 replication and highlight unique mechanisms for therapeutic development.

The pathogen SARS-CoV-2 replicates in the lower respiratory tract and causes fatal pneumonia. Although tremendous efforts have been put into investigating the pathogeny of SARS-CoV-2, the underlying mechanism of how SARS-CoV-2 interacts with its host is largely unexplored. Here, by comparing the genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 and human, we identified five fully conserved elements in SARS-CoV-2 genome, which were termed as ""human identical sequences (HIS)"". HIS are also recognized in both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV genome. Meanwhile, HIS-SARS-CoV-2 are highly conserved in the primate. Mechanically, HIS-SARS-CoV-2, behaving as virus-derived miRNAs, directly target to the human genomic loci and further interact with host enhancers to activate the expression of adjacent and distant genes, including cytokines gene and angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2), a well-known cell entry receptor of SARS-CoV-2, and hyaluronan synthase 2 (HAS2), which further increases hyaluronan formation. Noteworthily, hyaluronan level in plasma of COVID-19 patients is tightly correlated with severity and high risk for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and may act as a predictor for the progression of COVID-19. HIS antagomirs, which downregulate hyaluronan level effectively, and 4-Methylumbelliferone (MU), an inhibitor of hyaluronan synthesis, are potential drugs to relieve the ARDS related ground-glass pattern in lung for COVID-19 treatment. Our results revealed that unprecedented HIS elements of SARS-CoV-2 contribute to the cytokine storm and ARDS in COVID-19 patients.

This study aimed to identify factors associated with COVID-19 fear among health workers in Nepal during the early phase of pandemic.

MethodsA web-based cross-sectional survey was conducted in the month of April-May 2020 among 475 health workers directly involved in COVID-19 management. The Fear Scale of COVID 19 (FCV-19S) was used to measure the status of fear. Scatter plots were used to observe the relationship between fear and other psychological outcomes: anxiety, depression and insomnia. Multivariable logistic regression was done to identify factors associated with COVID fear.

ResultsCOVID-19 fear score was moderately correlated with anxiety and depression, and weakly correlated with insomnia (p<0.001). Nurses (AOR=2.29; 95% CI: 1.23-4.26), health workers experiencing stigma (AOR=1.83; 95% CI: 1.12-2.73), those working in affected district(AOR=1.76; 95% CI: 1.12-2.77) and presence of family member with chronic diseases (AOR=1.50; 95% CI: 1.01-2.25) was associated with higher odds of developing COVID-19 fear as compared to other health workers, health workers not experiencing stigma, working in non-affected district and not having family member with chronic diseases respectively.

ConclusionNurses, health workers facing stigma, those working in affect district and having family member with chronic diseases were more at risk of developing COVID-19 fear. It is thus recommended to improve work environment to reduce fear among health workers, employ stigma reduction interventions, and ensure personal and family support for those having family member with chronic diseases.",1,303,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.04.367912v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.04.367912v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2020.11.04.367912.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Drug repositioning is one of the strategies that has the potential to deliver therapeutics relatively quickly. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has shown that integrating critical data resources to drive drug-repositioning studies, involving host-host, hostpathogen and drug-target interactions, remains a time-consuming effort that translates to a delay in the development and delivery of a life-saving therapy.

ResultsHere, we describe a workflow we designed for a semi-automated integration of rapidly emerging datasets that can be generally adopted in a broad network pharmacology research setting. The workflow was used to construct a COVID-19 focused multimodal network that integrates 487 host-pathogen, 74,805 host-host protein and 1,265 drug-target interactions. The resultant Neo4j graph database named ""Neo4COVID19"" is accessible via a web interface and via API calls based on the Bolt protocol. We believe that our Neo4COVID19 database will be a valuable asset to the research community and will catalyze the discovery of therapeutics to fight COVID-19.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the primary host cell receptor that interacts with the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Although pneumonia is the main symptom in severe cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the expression levels of ACE2 in the lung is low, suggesting the presence of another receptor for the spike protein. In order to identify the additional receptors for the spike protein, we screened a receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein from the lung cDNA library. We cloned L-SIGN as a specific receptor for the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The RBD of the spike protein did not bind to L-SIGN. In addition, not only L-SIGN but also DC-SIGN, a closely related C-type lectin receptor to L-SIGN, bound to the NTD of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Importantly, cells expressing L-SIGN and DC-SIGN were both infected by SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, L-SIGN and DC-SIGN induced membrane fusion by associating with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Serum antibodies from infected patients and a patient-derived monoclonal antibody against NTD inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection of L-SIGN or DC-SIGN expressing cells.

Understanding the genome replication, assembly and egress of SARS-CoV-2, a multistage process that involves different cellular compartments and the activity of many viral and cellular proteins, is critically important as it bears the means of medical intervention to stop infection. Here, we investigated SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero cells under the near-native frozen-hydrated condition using a unique correlative multi-modal, multi-scale cryo-imaging approach combining soft X-ray cryo-tomography and serial cryoFIB/SEM volume imaging of the entire SARS-CoV-2 infected cell with cryo-electron tomography (cryoET) of cellular lamellae and cell periphery, as well as structure determination of viral components by subtomogram averaging. Our results reveal at the whole cell level profound cytopathic effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection, exemplified by a large amount of heterogeneous vesicles in the cytoplasm for RNA synthesis and virus assembly, formation of membrane tunnels through which viruses exit, and drastic cytoplasm invasion into nucleus. Furthermore, cryoET of cell lamellae reveals how viral RNAs are transported from double-membrane vesicles where they are synthesized to viral assembly sites; how viral spikes and RNPs assist in virus assembly and budding; and how fully assembled virus particles exit the cell, thus stablishing a model of SARS-CoV-2 genome replication, virus assembly and egress pathways.",1,444,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.05.370239v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.05.370239v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2020.11.05.370239.txt,1,field-specific repository,0,(f)  416  subtomogram average of spikes on released viruses at 9 å resolution fitted with an atomic  417  model of spike trimer (pdb 6zb5) (toelzer et al. 2020) viewed from side and top.;     (f) subtomogram average of spikes on released viruses at 9 å resolution fitted with an atomic model of spike trimer (pdb 6zb5) (toelzer et al. 2020) viewed from side and top.,NA

Seven coronaviruses (CoVs) have been shown to infect humans, including the recently emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19). The host response to CoV infection is complex and regulated, in part, by intracellular antiviral signaling pathways triggered in the first cells that are infected. Emerging evidence suggests that CoVs hijack these antiviral responses to reshape the production of interferons and proinflammatory cytokines. Processing bodies (PBs) are membraneless ribonucleoprotein granules that mediate decay or translational suppression of cellular mRNAs; this is particularly relevant for proinflammatory cytokine mRNA which normally reside in PBs and are repressed. Emerging evidence also suggests that PBs or their components play important direct-acting antiviral roles, providing a compelling reason for their frequent disassembly by many viruses. No information is known about how human CoVs impact PBs. Here, we provide data to show that infection with the human CoV, OC43, causes PB disassembly. Moreover, we show that several SARS-CoV-2 gene products also mediate PB loss and virus-induced PB loss correlates with elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokine mRNAs that would normally be repressed in PBs. Finally, we demonstrate that stimulating PB formation prior to OC43 infection restricts viral replication. These data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 and other CoVs disassemble PBs during infection to support viral replication and evade innate immune responses. As an unintended side effect, the disassembly of PBs enhances translation of proinflammatory cytokine mRNAs which normally reside in PBs, thereby reshaping the subsequent immune response.",1,249,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.08.372995v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.08.372995v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2020.11.08.372995.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

The superantigen specificity for binding different V{beta}-chains results in V{beta}-skewing, whereby T cells with specific V{beta}-chains and diverse antigen specificity are overrepresented in the TCR repertoire. Here, we characterized the TCR repertoire of MIS-C patients and found a profound expansion of TCR Beta Variable gene (TRBV)11-2. Furthermore, TRBV11-2 skewing was remarkably correlated with MIS-C severity and serum cytokine levels. Further analysis of TRBJ gene usage and CDR3 length distribution of MIS-C expanding TRBV11-2 clones revealed extensive junctional diversity, indicating a superantigen-mediated selection process for TRBV expansion. In silico modelling indicates that polyacidic residues in TCR V{beta}11-2 engage in strong interactions with the superantigen-like motif of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. Overall, our data indicate that the immune response in MIS-C is consistent with superantigenic activation.

Ever since the start of SARS-CoV-2, also known as COVID-19 pandemic, countless uncertainties have been revolving around the pathogenesis and epidemiology of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. While air pollution has been shown to be strongly correlated to increased SARS-CoV-2 morbidity and mortality, whether environmental pollutants such as ground level ozone affects the susceptibility of individuals to SARS-CoV-2 is not yet established.

ObjectiveTo investigate the impact of ozone inhalation on the expression levels of signatures associated with host susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2.

MethodsWe analyzed lung tissues collected from mice that were sub-chronically exposed to air or 0.8ppm ozone for three weeks (4h/night, 5 nights/week), and analyzed the expression of signatures associated with host susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2.

ResultsSARS-CoV-2 entry into the host cells requires proteolytic priming by the host-derived protease, transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). The TMPRSS2 protein and Tmprss2 transcripts were significantly elevated in the extrapulmonary airways, parenchyma, and alveolar macrophages from ozone-exposed mice. A significant proportion of additional known SARS-CoV-2 host susceptibility genes were upregulated in alveolar macrophages and parenchyma from ozone-exposed mice.

ConclusionsOur data indicate that the unhealthy levels of ozone in the environment may predispose individuals to severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Given the severity of this pandemic, and the challenges associated with direct testing of host-environment interactions in clinical settings, we believe that this mice-ozone-exposure based study informs the scientific community of the potentially detrimental effects of the ambient ozone levels determining the host susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2.",1,496,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.10.377408v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.10.377408v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2020.11.10.377408.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Neuraminidase (NEU)-mediated cleavage of surface sialic acid has been demonstrated to regulate leukocyte responses. Here, we report that antiviral NEU inhibitors constrain host NEU activity, surface sialic acid release, ROS production, and NETs released by microbial-activated human neutrophils. In vivo, treatment with Oseltamivir results in infection control and host survival in peritonitis and pneumonia models of sepsis. Single-cell RNA sequencing re-analysis of publicly data sets of respiratory tract samples from critical COVID-19 patients revealed an overexpression of NEU1 in infiltrated neutrophils. Moreover, Oseltamivir or Zanamivir treatment of whole blood cells from severe COVID-19 patients reduces host NEU-mediated shedding of cell surface sialic acid and neutrophil overactivation. These findings suggest that neuraminidase inhibitors can serve as host-directed interventions to dampen neutrophil dysfunction in severe infections.

At a GlanceIn a severe systemic inflammatory response, such as sepsis and COVID-19, neutrophils play a central role in organ damage. Thus, finding new ways to inhibit the exacerbated response of these cells is greatly needed. Here, we demonstrate that in vitro treatment of whole blood with the viral neuraminidase inhibitors Oseltamivir or Zanamivir, inhibits the activity of human neuraminidases as well as the exacerbated response of neutrophils.

However, it is not known if ACIS KEPTIDE attenuates the entry of SARS-CoV2 virus in vivo in lung and kidney tissues, protects health, and prevent death once applied through intranasal route. In our current manuscript, we demonstrated that the intranasal administration of SARS-CoV2 (1*106) strongly induced the expression of ACE-2, promoted the entry of virions into the lung and kidney cells, caused acute histopathological toxicities, and mortality (28%). Interestingly, thirty-minutes of pre-treatment with 50 g/Kg Body weight ACIS normalized the expression of ACE-2 via receptor internalization, strongly mitigated that viral entry, and prevented mortality suggesting its prospect as a prophylactic therapy in the treatment of COVID-19. On the contrary, the peptide backbone of ACIS was unable to normalize the expression of ACE-2, failed to improve the health vital signs and histopathological abnormalities. In summary, our results suggest that ACIS is a potential vaccine-alternative, prophylactic agent that prevents entry of SARS-CoV2 in vivo, significantly improves respiratory health and also dramatically prevents acute mortality in K18-hACE2 humanized mice.

HighlightsO_LIACIS KEPTIDE stimulates the internalization of ACE-2 receptor (Fig. 2) and buffers the membrane localization of ACE-2 receptors (Fig. 2, 6 & 8). Intranasal inoculation of SARS-CoV2 upregulates the expression of ACE-2 in lung epithelium (Fig.6) and kidney tubular cells (Fig.8). ACIS KEPTIDE normalizes the expression of ACE-2 in the kidney tubular cells of virus-treated K18-hACE2mice (Fig. 8).
C_LIO_LIACIS KEPTIDE completely prevents the entry of SARS-CoV2 in Bronchiolar epithelium (Fig.6), alveolar parenchyma (Fig. 6), and kidney tubular cells (Fig.8).
C_LIO_LIACIS KEPTIDE improves the pulmonary (Fig. 5) and renal pathological changes (Fig. 7) caused by the SARS-CoV2 virus insult.
C_LIO_LIIntranasal administration of 0.05% Beta-propiolactone ({beta}PL)-inactivated SARS-CoV2 (1 *106) causes significant death (28%) in K18-hACE2 humanized mice after 24 hrs of intranasal inoculation (Supplemental videos) suggesting that SARS-CoV2 does not require its infective properties and genetic mechanism to be functional to cause mortality.
C_LIO_LIThe peptide backbone of ACIS KEPTIDE provides much less and insignificant protection in the prevention of pathological changes in Lungs (Fig.5 & 6) and Kidney (Fig.7 & 8). Peptide failed to normalize the upscaled expression of ACE-2 in kidney tubular cells (Fig.8) of SARS-CoV2-treated K18-hACE2 mice.

The trimeric conformation was confirmed using electron microscopy and HPLC analysis. Binding to susceptible cells was shown using a virus-inhibition assay. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for detection of serum SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG1 was investigated and found to exceed that of Spike fragments (S1 and RBD).

In line with other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 has the potential to infect a broad range of hosts. SARS-CoV-2 genomes have now been isolated from cats, dogs, lions, tigers and minks. SARS-CoV-2 seems to transmit particularly well in mink farms with outbreaks reported in Spain, Sweden, the Netherlands, Italy, the USA and Denmark. Genomic data from SARS-CoV-2 isolated from infected minks provides a natural case study of a secondary host jump of the virus, in this case from humans to animals, and occasionally back again. We screened published SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated from minks for the presence of recurrent mutations common in mink but infrequent in SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated from human infections. We identify 23 recurrent mutations including three nonsynonymous mutations in the Receptor Binding Domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that independently emerged at least four times but are only rarely observed in human lineages. The repeat emergence of mutations across phylogenetically distinct lineages of the virus isolated from minks points to ongoing adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 to a new host. The rapid acquisition and spread of SARS-CoV-2 mutations in minks suggests that if a similar phenomenon of host adaptation had occurred upon its jump into humans, those human-specific mutations would likely have reached fixation already before the first SARS-CoV-2 genomes were generated.

In the present study, we firstly constructed an association landscape between over 20,000 single cell clusters and 997 complex phenotypes by a cross annotation framework with scRNA-seq expression profiles and GWAS summary statistics. We then performed an extensive overview of cell-type specificity and pleiotropy in human phenotypes and found most phenotypes (>90%) were moderately selectively associated with a limited number of cell types while a small fraction cell types (<10%) had strong pleiotropy in multiple phenotypes (~100). Moreover, we identified three cell type-phenotype mutual pleiotropy blocks in the landscape. The application of the single cell type-phenotype cross annotation framework (named SPA) also explained the T cell biased lymphopenia and suggested important supporting genes in severe COVID-19 from human genetics angle.

Diagnostic testing can be used as a tool in these settings to identify outbreaks and to control transmission.

MethodsWe used transmission modeling to estimate the minimum number of persons to test and the optimal frequency to detect small outbreaks of COVID-19 in a congregate facility. We also estimated the frequency of testing needed to interrupt transmission within a facility.

ResultsThe number of people to test and frequency of testing needed depended on turnaround time, facility size, and test characteristics. Parameters are calculated for a variety of scenarios. In a facility of 100 people, 26 randomly selected individuals would need to be tested at least every 6 days to identify a true underlying prevalence of at least 5%, with test sensitivity of 85%, and greater than 95% outbreak detection sensitivity. Disease transmission could be interrupted with universal, facility-wide testing with rapid turnaround every three days.

ConclusionsTesting a subset of individuals in congregate settings can improve early detection of small outbreaks of COVID-19. Frequent universal diagnostic testing can be used to interrupt transmission within a facility, but its efficacy is reliant on rapid turnaround of results for isolation of infected individuals.",1,368,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.20.391011v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.20.391011v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2020.11.20.391011.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

However, commercial face masks contain filters that are made of materials that are not capable of inactivating neither SARS-CoV-2 nor multidrug-resistant bacteria. Therefore, symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals can infect other people even if they wear them because some viable viral or bacterial loads can escape from the masks. Furthermore, viral or bacterial contact transmission can occur after touching the mask, which constitutes an increasing source of contaminated biological waste. Additionally, bacterial pathogens contribute to the SARS-CoV-2 mediated pneumonia disease complex and their resistance to antibiotics in pneumonia treatment is increasing at an alarming rate. In this regard, herein, we report the development of a novel protective non-woven face mask filter fabricated with a biofunctional coating of benzalkonium chloride that is capable of inactivating SARS-CoV-2 in one minute of contact, and the life-threatening methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis.

Our aim was to study colonic ACE2 expression in Crohns disease (CD) and non-inflammatory bowel disease (non-IBD) controls. We hypothesized that the colonic expression levels of ACE2 impacts CD course.

MethodsWe examined the expression of colon ACE2 using RNA-seq and quantitative (q) RT-PCR from 69 adult CD and 14 NIBD control patients. In a subset of this cohort we validated ACE2 protein expression and localization in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded matched colon and ileal tissues using immunohistochemistry. The impact of increased ACE2 expression in CD for the risk of surgery was evaluated by a multivariate regression analysis and a Kaplan-Meier estimator. To provide critical support for the generality of our findings, we analyzed previously published RNA-seq data from two large independent cohorts of CD patients.

ResultsColonic ACE2 expression was significantly higher in a subset of adult CD patients (ACE2-high CD). IHC in a sampling of ACE2-high CD patients confirmed high ACE2 protein expression in the colon and ileum compared to ACE2-low CD and NIBD patients. Notably, we found that ACE2-high CD patients are significantly more likely to undergo surgery within 5 years of diagnosis, with a Cox regression analysis finding that high ACE2 levels is an independent risk factor (OR 2.18; 95%CI, 1.05-4.55; p=0.037).

ConclusionIncreased intestinal expression of ACE2 is associated with deteriorated clinical outcomes in CD patients.

Despite its relevance, there is scarce information about its evolutionary traces. The aim of this study was to investigate the diversification patterns of the spike for each clade of SARS-CoV-2 through different approaches.

MethodsTwo thousand and one hundred sequences representing the seven clades of the SARS-CoV-2 were included. Patterns of genetic diversifications and nucleotide evolutionary rate were estimated for the spike genomic region.

ResultsThe haplotype networks showed a star shape, where multiple haplotypes with few nucleotide differences diverge from a common ancestor. Four hundred seventy nine different haplotypes were defined in the seven analyzed clades. The main haplotype, named Hap-1, was the most frequent for clades G (54%), GH (54%), and GR (56%) and a different haplotype (named Hap-252) was the most important for clades L (63.3%), O (39.7%), S (51.7%), and V (70%). The evolutionary rate for the spike protein was estimated as 1.08 x 10-3 nucleotide substitutions/site/year. Moreover, the nucleotide evolutionary rate after nine months of pandemic was similar for each clade.

ConclusionsIn conclusion, the present evolutionary analysis is relevant since the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is the target for most therapeutic candidates; besides, changes in this protein could have consequences on viral transmission, response to antivirals and efficacy of vaccines. Moreover, the evolutionary characterization of clades improves knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 and deserves to be assessed in more detail since re-infection by different phylogenetic clades has been reported.",1,368,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.24.396671v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.24.396671v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2020.11.24.396671.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Here, we use RNA-sequencing and ribosome profiling along SARS-CoV-2 infection and comprehensively define the mechanisms that are utilized by SARS-CoV-2 to shutoff cellular protein synthesis. We show SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to a global reduction in translation but that viral transcripts are not preferentially translated. Instead, we reveal that infection leads to accelerated degradation of cytosolic cellular mRNAs which facilitates viral takeover of the mRNA pool in infected cells. Moreover, we show that the translation of transcripts whose expression is induced in response to infection, including innate immune genes, is impaired, implying infection prevents newly transcribed cellular mRNAs from accessing the ribosomes.

After such individuals have cleared the virus, only the detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific immunological memory can reveal the exposure, and hopefully the establishment of immune protection. With most viral infections, the presence of specific serum antibodies has provided a reliable biomarker for the exposure to the virus of interest. SARS-CoV-2 infection, however, does not reliably induce a durable antibody response, especially in sub-clinically infected individuals. Consequently, it is plausible for a recently infected individual to yield a false negative result within only a few months after exposure. Immunodiagnostic attention has therefore shifted to studies of specific T cell memory to SARS-CoV-2. Most reports published so far agree that a T cell response is engaged during SARS-CoV-2 infection, but they also state that in 20-81% of non-SARS-CoV-2-exposed individuals, T cells respond to SARS-CoV-2 antigens (mega peptide pools), allegedly due to T cell cross-reactivity with coronaviruses causing Common Cold (CCC), or other antigens. Here we show that by introducing irrelevant mega peptide pools as negative controls to account for chance cross-reactivity, and by establishing the antigen dose-response characteristic of the T cells, one can clearly discern between cognate T cell memory induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection vs. cross-reactive T cell responses in individuals who had not been infected with SARS-CoV-2.",1,284,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.29.402677v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.29.402677v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2020.11.29.402677.txt,1,supplement,0,raw data are shown in s. table 4,NA

Small molecule inhibitors that reverse disease severity have proven difficult to discover. One of the key approaches that has been widely applied in an effort to speed up the translation of drugs is drug repurposing. A few drugs have shown in vitro activity against Ebola virus and demonstrated activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vivo. Most notably the RNA polymerase targeting remdesivir demonstrated activity in vitro and efficacy in the early stage of the disease in humans. Testing other small molecule drugs that are active against Ebola virus would seem a reasonable strategy to evaluate their potential for SARS-CoV-2. We have previously repurposed pyronaridine, tilorone and quinacrine (from malaria, influenza, and antiprotozoal uses, respectively) as inhibitors of Ebola and Marburg virus in vitro in HeLa cells and of mouse adapted Ebola virus in mouse in vivo. We have now tested these three drugs in various cell lines (VeroE6, Vero76, Caco-2, Calu-3, A549-ACE2, HUH-7 and monocytes) infected with SARS-CoV-2 as well as other viruses (including MHV and HCoV 229E). The compilation of these results indicated considerable variability in antiviral activity observed across cell lines. We found that tilorone and pyronaridine inhibited the virus replication in A549-ACE2 cells with IC50 values of 180 nM and IC50 198 nM, respectively. We have also tested them in a pseudovirus assay and used microscale thermophoresis to test the binding of these molecules to the spike protein. They bind to spike RBD protein with Kd values of 339 nM and 647 nM, respectively. Human Cmax for pyronaridine and quinacrine is greater than the IC50 hence justifying in vivo evaluation.

Fever is an evolutionarily conserved host response to microbial infection and inflammation that can influence the outcome of viral pathogenicity and regulation of host innate and adaptive immune responses. However, it remains to be determined what effect elevated temperature has on SARS-CoV-2 tropism and replication. Utilizing a 3D air-liquid interface (ALI) model that closely mimics the natural tissue physiology and cellular tropism of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the respiratory airway, we identify tissue temperature to play an important role in the regulation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We show that temperature elevation induces wide-spread transcriptome changes that impact upon the regulation of multiple pathways, including epigenetic regulation and lncRNA expression, without disruption of general cellular transcription or the induction of interferon (IFN)-mediated antiviral immune defences. Respiratory tissue incubated at temperatures >37{degrees}C remained permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection but severely restricted the initiation of viral transcription, leading to significantly reduced levels of intraepithelial viral RNA accumulation and apical shedding of infectious virus.

The Spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is crucial to mediate viral entry into host cells; however, whether it can be cellularly pathogenic and contribute to pulmonary hyper-inflammations in COVID-19 is not well known.

Methods and FindingsIn this study, we developed a Spike protein-pseudotyped (Spp) lentivirus with the proper tropism of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein on the surface and tracked down the fate of Spp in wild type C57BL/6J mice receiving intravenous injection of the virus. A lentivirus with vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G) was used as the control. Two hours post-infection (hpi), Spp showed more than 27-75 times more viral burden in the lungs than other organs; it also exhibited about 3-5 times more viral burden than VSV-G lentivirus in the lungs, liver, kidney and spleen. Acute pneumonia was evident in animals 24 hpi. Spp lentivirus was mainly found in LDLR+ macrophages and pneumocytes in the lungs, but not in MARC1+ macrophages. IL6, IL10, CD80 and PPAR-{gamma} were quickly upregulated in response to infection of Spp lentivirus in the lungs in vivo as well as in macrophage-like RAW264.7 cells in vitro. We further confirmed that forced expression of the Spike protein in RAW264.7 cells could significantly increase the mRNA levels of the same panel of inflammatory factors.

The S protein of SARS-CoV-2, similar to type I fusion proteins of viruses such as HIV-1 envelope (Env) and influenza hemagglutinin, is heavily glycosylated. Viral Env glycans, though host derived, are distinctly processed and thereby recognized or accommodated during antibody responses. In recent years, highly potent and/or broadly neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies (bnAbs) that are generated in chronic HIV-1 infections have been defined. These bnAbs exhibit atypical features such as extensive somatic hypermutations, long complementary determining region (CDR) lengths, tyrosine sulfation and presence of insertions/deletions, enabling them to effectively neutralize diverse HIV-1 viruses despite extensive variations within the core epitopes they recognize. As some of the HIV-1 bnAbs have evolved to recognize the dense viral glycans and cross-reactive epitopes (CREs), we assessed if these bnAbs cross-react with SARS-CoV-2. Several HIV-1 bnAbs showed cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV-2 while one HIV-1 CD4 binding site bnAb, N6, neutralized SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, neutralizing plasma antibodies of chronically HIV-1 infected children showed cross neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2. Collectively, our observations suggest that human monoclonal antibodies tolerating extensive epitope variability can be leveraged to neutralize pathogens with related antigenic profile.

ImportanceIn the current ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, neutralizing antibodies have been shown to be a critical feature of recovered patients. HIV-1 bnAbs recognize extensively diverse cross-reactive epitopes and tolerate diversity within their core epitope. Given the unique nature of HIV-1 bnAbs and their ability to recognize and/or accommodate viral glycans, we reasoned that the glycan shield of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein can be targeted by HIV-1 specific bnAbs. Herein, we showed that HIV-1 specific antibodies cross-react and neutralize SARS-CoV-2. Understanding cross-reactive neutralization epitopes of antibodies generated in divergent viral infections will provide key evidence for engineering so called super-antibodies (antibodies that can potently neutralize diverse pathogens with similar antigenic features).

Coronaviruses employ between twenty and thirty proteins to carry out their viral replication cycle including infection, immune evasion, and replication. Among these, nonstructural protein 16 (Nsp16), a 2-O-methyltransferase, plays an essential role in immune evasion. Nsp16 achieves this by mimicking its human homolog, CMTr1, which methylates mRNA to enhance translation efficiency and distinguish self from other. Unlike human CMTr1, Nsp16 requires a binding partner, Nsp10, to activate its enzymatic activity. The requirement of this binding partner presents two questions that we investigate in this manuscript. First, how does Nsp10 activate Nsp16? While experimentally-derived structures of the active Nsp16/Nsp10 complex exist, structures of inactive, monomeric Nsp16 have yet to be solved. Therefore, it is unclear how Nsp10 activates Nsp16. Using over one millisecond of molecular dynamics simulations of both Nsp16 and its complex with Nsp10, we investigate how the presence of Nsp10 shifts Nsp16s conformational ensemble in order to activate it. Second, guided by this activation mechanism and Markov state models (MSMs), we investigate if Nsp16 adopts inactive structures with cryptic pockets that, if targeted with a small molecule, could inhibit Nsp16 by stabilizing its inactive state. After identifying such a pocket in SARS-CoV-2 Nsp16, we show that this cryptic pocket also opens in SARS-CoV-1 and MERS, but not in human CMTr1. Therefore, it may be possible to develop pan-coronavirus antivirals that target this cryptic pocket.

Statement of SignificanceCoronaviruses are a major threat to human health. These viruses employ molecular machines, called proteins, to infect host cells and replicate. Characterizing the structure and dynamics of these proteins could provide a basis for designing small molecule antivirals. In this work, we use computer simulations to understand the moving parts of an essential SARS-CoV-2 protein, understand how a binding partner turns it on and off, and identify a novel pocket that antivirals could target to shut this protein off. The pocket is also present in other coronaviruses but not in the related human protein, so it could be a valuable target for pan-coronavirus antivirals.",1,313,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.10.420109v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.10.420109v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2020.12.10.420109.txt,1,field-specific repository,0,it is made available under acc-by-nc-nd 4.0 international license.  depicts sasa of pocket residues in the crystal structure of nsp16/nsp10 complex (pdb: 6wks).,NA

This variation is derived from discontinuous subgenomic RNA synthesis where the polymerase switches template from a 3 proximal genome body sequence to a 5 untranslated leader sequence. This leads to a fusion between the common 5 leader sequence and a 3 proximal body sequence in the RNA product. This process revolves around a common core sequence (CS) that is present at both the template sites that make up the fusion junction. Base-pairing between the leader CS and the nascent complementary minus strand body CS, and flanking regions (together called the transcription regulating sequence, TRS) is vital for this template switching event. However, various factors can influence the site of template switching within the same TRS duplex.

To investigate whether naturally occurring mutations in the spike protein are able to prevent antibody binding, yet while maintaining the ability to bind ACE2 and viral infectivity, mutations in the spike protein identified in cases of human infection were mapped to the crystallographically-determined interfaces between the spike protein and ACE2 (PDB entry 6M0J), antibody CC12.1 (PDB entry 6XC2), and antibody P2B-2F6 (PDB entry 7BWJ).

Both antibody binding interfaces partially overlap with the ACE2 binding interface. Among 16 mutations that map to the RBD:CC12.1 interface, 11 are likely to disrupt CC12.1 binding but not ACE2 binding. Among 12 mutations that map to the RBD:P2B-2F6 interface, 8 are likely to disrupt P2B-2F6 binding but not ACE2 binding. As expected, none of the mutations observed to date appear likely to disrupt the RBD:ACE2 interface.

We conclude that SARS-CoV-2 with mutated forms of the spike protein may retain the ability to bind ACE2 while evading recognition by antibodies that arise in response to the original wild-type form of the spike protein. It seems likely that immune evasion will be possible regardless of whether the spike protein was encountered in the form of infectious virus, or as the immunogen in a vaccine. Therefore, it also seems likely that reinfection with a variant strain of SARS-CoV-2 may occur among people who recover from Covid-19, and that vaccines with the ability to generate antibodies against multiple variant forms of the spike protein will be necessary to protect against variant forms of SARS-CoV-2 that are already circulating in the human population.",1,329,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.13.422567v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.13.422567v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2020.12.13.422567.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 is known as COVID-19. To date, few treatments for COVID-19 have proven effective, and the current standard of care is primarily supportive. As a result, novel therapeutic strategies are in high demand. Viral entry into target cells is frequently sensitive to cell membrane lipid composition and membrane organization. Evidence suggests that cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 is most efficient when the target cell plasma membrane is replete with cholesterol; and recent data implicate cholesterol flux through the high-affinity receptor for cholesterol-rich high-density lipoprotein (HDL), called scavenger receptor type B-1 (SR-B1), as critical for SARS-CoV-2 entry. Here, we demonstrate that a cholesterol-poor synthetic biologic high-density lipoprotein (HDL NP) targets SR-B1 and inhibits cell entry of a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein pseudovirus. Human cells expressing SR-B1 are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and viral entry can be inhibited by 50-80% using HDL NPs in an SR-B1-dependent manner.

Here, we report that co-culture of human cells expressing the receptor ACE2 with cells expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike, results in synapse-like intercellular contacts that initiate cell-cell fusion, producing syncytia resembling those we identify in lungs of COVID-19 patients. To assess the mechanism of spike/ACE2-driven membrane fusion, we developed a microscopy-based, cell-cell fusion assay to screen [~]6000 drugs and >30 spike variants. Together with cell biological and biophysical approaches, the screen reveals an essential role for membrane cholesterol in spike-mediated fusion, which extends to replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 isolates. Our findings provide a molecular basis for positive outcomes reported in COVID-19 patients taking statins, and suggest new strategies for therapeutics targeting the membrane of SARS-CoV-2 and other fusogenic viruses.

In this study, we report an expedited drug discovery approach by coupling structure-based design and Ugi four-component (Ugi-4CR) reaction methodology to the design of non-covalent Mpro inhibitors. The most potent compound 23R had cellular antiviral activity similar to covalent inhibitors such as GC376.

A growing number of studies have focused on immunological determinants to develop better biomarkers for therapies.

AimThe dynamics of the insurgence of immunity is at the core of the both SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development and therapies. This paper addresses a fundamental question in the management of the infection: can we describe the insurgence (and the span) of immunity in COVID-19? The in-silico model developed here answers this question at individual (personalized) and population levels.

We simulate the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and analyze the impact of infecting viral load, affinity to the ACE2 receptor and age in the artificially infected population on the course of the disease.

MethodsWe use a stochastic agent-based immune simulation platform to construct a virtual cohort of infected individuals with age-dependent varying degree of immune competence. We use a parameter setting to reproduce known inter-patient variability and general epidemiological statistics.

ResultsWe reproduce in-silico a number of clinical observations and we identify critical factors in the statistical evolution of the infection. In particular we evidence the importance of the humoral response over the cytotoxic response and find that the antibody titers measured after day 25 from the infection is a prognostic factor for determining the clinical outcome of the infection.

Our modeling framework uses COVID-19 infection to demonstrate the actionable effectiveness of simulating the immune response at individual and population levels. The model developed is able to explain and interpret observed patterns of infection and makes verifiable temporal predictions.

Within the limitations imposed by the simulated environment, this work proposes in a quantitative way that the great variability observed in the patient outcomes in real life can be the mere result of subtle variability in the infecting viral load and immune competence in the population.

In this work we i) show the power of model predictions, ii) identify the clinical end points that could be more suitable for computational modeling of COVID-19 immune response, iii) define the resolution and amount of data required to empower this class of models for translational medicine purposes and, iv) we exemplify how computational modeling of immune response provides an important view to discuss hypothesis and design new experiments, in particular paving the way to further investigations about the duration of vaccine-elicited immunity especially in the view of the blundering effect of immunesenescence.",1,51,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.20.423670v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.20.423670v2.full.pdf,_10.1101_2020.12.20.423670.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Monocytes are heterogeneous and characterized by three distinct subsets in humans. Classical and non-classical monocytes represent the most abundant subsets, each carrying out distinct biological functions. Consequently, altered frequencies of different subsets have been associated with inflammatory conditions, such as infections and autoimmune disorders including lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and, more recently, COVID-19. Dissecting the contribution of different monocyte subsets to disease is currently limited by samples and cohorts, often resulting in underpowered studies and, consequently, poor reproducibility. Public transcriptomes provide an alternative source of data characterized by high statistical power and real world heterogeneity. However, most transcriptome datasets profile bulk blood or tissue samples, requiring the use of in silico approaches to quantify changes in the levels of specific cell types.

Here, we integrated 853 publicly available microarray expression profiles of sorted human monocyte subsets from 45 independent studies to identify robust and parsimonious gene expression signatures, consisting of 10 genes specific to each subset. These signatures, although derived using only datasets profiling healthy individuals, maintain their accuracy independent of the disease state in an independent cohort profiled by RNA-sequencing (AUC = 1.0). Furthermore, we demonstrate that our signatures are specific to monocyte subsets compared to other immune cells such as B, T, dendritic cells (DCs) and natural killer (NK) cells (AUC = 0.87~0.88, p<2.2e-16). This increased specificity results in estimated monocyte subset levels that are strongly correlated with cytometry-based quantification of cellular subsets (r = 0.69, p = 6.7e-4). Consequently, we show that these monocyte subset-specific signatures can be used to quantify changes in monocyte subsets levels in expression profiles from patients in clinical trials.

Analytical efficiency of the E-Sarbeco primer/probe set, for example, was ~83%, while assay precision, as measured by the coefficient of variation, was ~2% at 1000 input copies/reaction. Lower limits of quantification and detection for this primer/probe set were 18.6 and 4.4 input SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies/reaction, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 RNA viral loads in a convenience panel of 48 COVID-19-positive diagnostic specimens spanned a 6.2log10 range, confirming substantial viral load variation in vivo. We further calibrated RT-ddPCR-derived SARS-CoV-2 E gene copy numbers against cycle threshold (Ct) values from a commercial real-time RT-PCR diagnostic platform. The resulting log-linear relationship can be used to mathematically derive SARS-CoV-2 RNA copy numbers from Ct values, allowing the wealth of available diagnostic test data to be harnessed to address foundational questions in SARS-CoV-2 biology.",1,511,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.21.423898v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.21.423898v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2020.12.21.423898.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

SARS-CoV-2 targets epithelial cells in the respiratory tract and lungs, which can lead to amplified chloride secretion and increased leak across epithelial barriers, contributing to severe pneumonia and consolidation of the lungs as seen in many COVID-19 patients. There is an urgent need for a better understanding of the molecular aspects that contribute to SARS-CoV-2-induced pathogenesis and for the development of approaches to mitigate these damaging pathologies. The multifunctional SARS-CoV-2 Envelope (E) protein contributes to virus assembly/egress, and as a membrane protein, also possesses viroporin channel properties that may contribute to epithelial barrier damage, pathogenesis, and disease severity. The extreme C-terminal (ECT) sequence of E also contains a putative PDZ-domain binding motif (PBM), similar to that identified in the E protein of SARS-CoV-1. Here, we screened an array of GST-PDZ domain fusion proteins using either a biotin-labeled WT or mutant ECT peptide from the SARS-CoV-2 E protein. Notably, we identified a singular specific interaction between the WT E peptide and the second PDZ domain of human Zona Occludens-1 (ZO1), one of the key regulators of TJ formation/integrity in all epithelial tissues. We used homogenous time resolve fluorescence (HTRF) as a second complementary approach to further validate this novel modular E-ZO1 interaction. We postulate that SARS-CoV-2 E interacts with ZO1 in infected epithelial cells, and this interaction may contribute, in part, to tight junction damage and epithelial barrier compromise in these cell layers leading to enhanced virus spread and severe respiratory dysfunction that leads to morbidity. Prophylactic/therapeutic intervention targeting this virus-host interaction may effectively reduce airway barrier damage and mitigate virus spread.",1,568,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.22.422708v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.22.422708v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2020.12.22.422708.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

In this study, to understand genome evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in the current pandemic, we examined mutations of SARS-CoV-2 nsp14 which could inhibit its error-correcting function. First, to obtain functionally important sites of nsp14, we examined 62 representative coronaviruses belonging to alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and unclassified coronaviruses. As a result, 99 out of 527 amino acid sites of nsp14 were evolutionarily conserved. We then examined nsp14 sequences obtained from 28,082 SARS-CoV-2 genomes and identified 6 amino acid changes in nsp14 mutants that were not detected in the 62 representative coronaviruses. We examined genome substitution rates of these mutants and found that an nsp14 mutant with a proline to leucine change at position 203 (P203L) showed a higher substitution rate (35.9 substitutions/year) than SARS-CoV-2 possessing wild-type nsp14 (19.8 substitutions/year).

An improved understanding of T-cell immunity will greatly aid in the development of new cancer immunotherapies and vaccines for life threatening pathogens. Central to the design of such targeted therapies are computational methods to predict non-native epitopes to elicit a T cell response, however, we currently lack accurate immunogenicity inference methods. Another challenge is the ability to accurately simulate immunogenic peptides for specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles, for both synthetic biological applications and to augment real training datasets. Here, we proposed a beta-binomial distribution approach to derive epitope immunogenic potential from sequence alone. We conducted systematic benchmarking of five traditional machine learning (ElasticNet, KNN, SVM, Random Forest, AdaBoost) and three deep learning models (CNN, ResNet, GNN) using three independent prior validated immunogenic peptide collections (dengue virus, cancer neoantigen and SARS-Cov-2). We chose the CNN model as the best prediction model based on its adaptivity for small and large datasets, and performance relative to existing methods. In addition to outperforming two highly used immunogenicity prediction algorithms, DeepHLApan and IEDB, DeepImmuno-CNN further correctly predicts which residues are most important for T cell antigen recognition. Our independent generative adversarial network (GAN) approach, DeepImmuno-GAN, was further able to accurately simulate immunogenic peptides with physiochemical properties and immunogenicity predictions similar to that of real antigens. We provide DeepImmuno-CNN as source code and an easy-to-use web interface.

We initially demonstrated the dual inhibition profile of Montelukast through multiscale molecular modeling studies. Next, we characterized its effect on both targets by different in vitro experiments including the Fluorescent Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)-based main protease enzyme inhibition assay, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy, pseudovirus neutralization on HEK293T / hACE2, and virus neutralization assay using xCELLigence MP real time cell analyzer. Our integrated in silico and in vitro results confirmed the dual potential effect of the Montelukast both on virus entry into the host cell (Spike/ACE2) and on the main protease enzyme inhibition. The virus neutralization assay results showed that while no cytotoxicity of the Montelukast was observed at 12 M concentration, the cell index time 50 (CIT50) value was delayed for 12 hours. Moreover, it was also shown that Favipiravir, a well-known antiviral used in COVID-19 therapy, should be used by 16-fold higher concentrations than Montelukast in order to have the same effect of Montelukast. The rapid use of new small molecules in the pandemic is very important today. Montelukast, whose pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties are very well characterized and has been widely used in the treatment of asthma since 1998, should urgently be completed in clinical phase studies and if its effect is proven in clinical phase studies, it should be used against COVID-19.",1,112,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.26.424423v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.26.424423v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2020.12.26.424423.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Here we revisit T-B cooperation as a prerequisite for effective and durable neutralizing antibody responses centered on a mutationally constrained RBM B cell epitope. T-B cooperation requires co-processing of B and T cell epitopes by the same B cell and is subject to MHC-II restriction. We evaluated MHC-II constraints relevant to the neutralizing antibody response to a mutationally-constrained B cell epitope in the receptor binding motif (RBM) of the spike protein. Examining common MHC-II alleles, we found that peptides surrounding this key B cell epitope are predicted to bind poorly, suggesting a lack MHC-II support in T-B cooperation, impacting generation of high-potency neutralizing antibodies in the general population. Additionally, we found that multiple microbial peptides had potential for RBM cross-reactivity, supporting previous exposures as a possible source of T cell memory.

The serine protease TMPRSS2 has been shown to be important for S protein priming and viral entry, however, little is known about its regulation. SPINT2 is a member of the family of Kunitz type serine protease inhibitors and has been shown to inhibit TMPRSS2. Here, we explored the existence of a co-regulation between SPINT2/TMPRSS2 and found a tightly regulated protease/inhibitor expression balance across tissues. We found that SPINT2 negatively correlates with SARS-CoV-2 expression in Calu-3 and Caco-2 cell lines and was down-regulated in secretory cells from COVID-19 patients. We validated our findings using Calu-3 cell lines and observed a strong increase in viral load after SPINT2 knockdown. Additionally, we evaluated the expression of SPINT2 in datasets from comorbid diseases using bulk and scRNA-seq data.

Here, we define correlates of protection of neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in SARS-CoV-2-infected animals. Whereas Fc effector functions are dispensable when representative neutralizing mAbs are administered as prophylaxis, they are required for optimal protection as therapy. When given after infection, intact mAbs reduce SARS-CoV-2 burden and lung disease in mice and hamsters better than loss-of-function Fc variant mAbs. Fc engagement of neutralizing antibodies mitigates inflammation and improves respiratory mechanics, and transcriptional profiling suggests these phenotypes are associated with diminished innate immune signaling and preserved tissue repair.

Unfolding curves revealed that the frameshift signal formed multiple different structures: at least two distinct pseudoknotted conformers with different unfolding forces and energy barriers, as well as alternative stem-loop structures. Refolding curves showed that stem 1 formed first in the pseudoknotted conformers, followed by stem 3 and then stem 2. By extending the handle holding the RNA to occlude the 5' end of stem 1, the proportion of the different pseudoknot conformers could be altered systematically, consistent with structures observed in cryo-EM images and computational simulations that had distinct topologies: the 5' end of the RNA threaded through the 3-helix junction to form a ring-knot, or unthreaded as in more standard H-type pseudoknots.

The classical stochastic sampling algorithm can sample secondary structures according to their probabilities in the Boltzmann ensemble, and is widely used. However, the current sampling algorithm, consisting of a bottom-up partition function phase followed by a top-down sampling phase, suffers from three limitations: (a) the formulation and implementation of the sampling phase are unnecessarily complicated; (b) the sampling phase recalculates many redundant recursions already done during the partition function phase; (c) the partition function run-time scales cubically with the sequence length. These issues prevent it from being used for very long RNAs such as the full genomes of SARS-CoV-2. To address these problems, we first adopt a hypergraph framework under which the sampling algorithm can be greatly simplified. We then present three sampling algorithms under this framework, two of which eliminate redundant work in the sampling phase by caching. Finally, we present LinearSampling, an end-to-end linear-time sampling algorithm that is orders of magnitude faster than the standard one. For instance, LinearSampling is 176 x faster (38.9s vs. 1.9h) than Vienna RNAsubopt on the full genome of Ebola virus (18,959 nt). More importantly, LinearSampling can scale up to the full genome of SARS-CoV-2, taking only 69.2 seconds on its reference sequence (29,903 nt). It finds 23 regions of 15 nt with high accessibilities, which can be potentially used for COVID-19 diagnostics and drug design.

In addition to respiratory complications as a result of SARS-CoV-2 illness, accumulating evidence suggests that neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms are associated with the disease caused by the virus. In this study, we investigated the effects of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein S1 stimulation on neuroinflammation in BV-2 microglia. Analyses of culture supernatants revealed an increase in the production of TNF, IL-6, IL-1{beta} and iNOS/NO. SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein S1 increased protein expressions of phospho-p65 and phospho-I{kappa}B, as well as enhancing DNA binding and transcriptional activity of NF-{kappa}B. Pro-inflammatory effects of the glycoprotein effects were reduced in the presence of BAY11-7082 (1 M). The presence of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein S1 in BV-2 microglia increased the protein expression of NLRP3, as well as caspase-1 activity. However, pre-treatment with CRID3 (1 M) or BAY11-7082 (1 M) resulted in the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome/caspase-1. It was also observed that CRID3 attenuated SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein S1-induced increase in IL-1{beta} production. Increased protein expression of p38 MAPK was observed in BV-2 microglia stimulated with the spike glycoprotein S1, and was reduced in the presence of SKF 86002. These results have provided the first evidence demonstrating SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 glycoprotein-induced neuroinflammation in BV-2 microglia. We propose that promotion of neuroinflammation by this glycoprotein is mediated through activation of NF-{kappa}B, NLRP3 inflammasome and p38 MAPK.

While the majority of these regions are variable in sequence, a 41-nucleotide s2m element within the 3 UTR is highly conserved among coronaviruses and three other viral families. In this study, we demonstrate that the s2m element of SARS-CoV-2 dimerizes by forming an intermediate homodimeric kissing complex structure that is subsequently converted to a thermodynamically stable duplex conformation. This process is aided by the viral nucleocapsid protein, potentially indicating a role in mediating genome dimerization.

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein has a pivotal role in cell-entry and host immune response, thus regarded as potential drug- and vaccine-target. As the virus utilizes the S1 domain of spike to initiate cell-attachment and S2 domain for membrane fusion, several attempts have been made to design viral-receptor and viral-fusion blockers. Here, by deploying interactive structure-based design and pharmacophore-based approaches, we designed short and stable peptide-biologics i.e. CoV-spike-neutralizing peptides (CSNPs) including CSNP1, CSNP2, CSNP3, CSNP4. We could demonstrate in cell culture experiments that CSNP2 binds to S1 at submicromolar concentration and abrogates the S1-hACE2 interaction. CSNP3, a modified and downsized form of CSNP2, could neither interfere with the S1-hACE2 interaction nor bind to S1. CSNP4 exhibited dose-dependent binding to both S1 and hACE2 and abolished the S1-hACE2 interaction in vitro. CSNP4 possibly enhance the mAb-based S1 neutralization by limiting the spontaneous movement of spike receptor-binding domain (RBD), whereas CSNP2 allowed RBD-mAb binding without any steric hindrance.

Two rMVA COVID-19 vaccine trials are at an initial stage, though no animal protection studies have been reported. Here, we characterize rMVAs expressing the S protein of CoV-2. Modifications of full length S individually or in combination included two proline substitutions, mutations of the furin recognition site and deletion of the endoplasmic retrieval signal. Another rMVA in which the receptor binding domain (RBD) flanked by the signal peptide and transmembrane domains of S was also constructed. Each modified S protein was displayed on the surface of rMVA-infected human cells and was recognized by anti-RBD antibody and by soluble hACE2 receptor. Intramuscular injection of mice with the rMVAs induced S-binding and pseudovirus-neutralizing antibodies. Boosting occurred following a second homologous rMVA but was higher with adjuvanted purified RBD protein. Weight loss and lethality following intranasal infection of transgenic hACE2 mice with CoV-2 was prevented by one or two immunizations with rMVAs or by passive transfer of serum from vaccinated mice. One or two rMVA vaccinations also prevented recovery of infectious CoV-2 from the lungs. A low amount of virus was detected in the nasal turbinates of only one of eight rMVA-vaccinated mice on day 2 and none later. Detection of subgenomic mRNA in turbinates on day 2 only indicated that replication was abortive in immunized animals.

SignificanceVaccines are required to control COVID-19 during the pandemic and possibly afterwards. Recombinant nucleic acids, proteins and virus vectors that stimulate immune responses to the CoV-2 S protein have provided protection in experimental animal or human clinical trials, though questions remain regarding their ability to prevent spread and the duration of immunity. The present study focuses on replication-restricted modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), which has been shown to be a safe, immunogenic and stable smallpox vaccine and a promising vaccine vector for other infectious diseases and cancer.

We performed sequence and structural analyses to explore how antibody features correlate with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. Cryo-EM structures of 910-30 bound to the SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer revealed its binding interactions and ability to disassemble spike. Despite heavy chain sequence similarity, biophysical analyses of IGHV3-53/3-66 antibodies highlighted the importance of native heavy:light pairings for ACE2 binding competition and for SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. We defined paired heavy:light sequence signatures and determined antibody precursor prevalence to be ~1 in 44,000 human B cells, consistent with public antibody identification in several convalescent COVID-19 patients.

The Spike protein, responsible for cell receptor binding and viral internalization, possesses multiple disulfide bonds raising the possibility that disulfide-reducing agents might disrupt Spike function, prevent viral entry and serve as effective drugs against SARS-CoV-2. Here we show the first experimental evidence that reagents capable of reducing disulfide bonds can inhibit viral infection in cell-based assays. Molecular dynamics simulations of the Spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) predict increased domain flexibility when the four disulfide bonds of the domain are reduced. This flexibility is particularly prominent for the surface loop, comprised of residues 456-490, which interacts with the Spike cell receptor ACE2. Consistent with this finding, the addition of exogenous disulfide bond reducing agents affects the RBD secondary structure, lowers its melting temperature from 52 to 36-39{degrees}C and decreases its binding affinity to ACE2 by two orders of magnitude at 37{degrees}C. Finally, the reducing agents dithiothreitol (DTT) and tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) inhibit viral replication at high {micro}M - low mM levels with a negligible effect on cell viability at these concentrations. The antiviral effect of monothiol-based reductants N-Acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) and reduced glutathione (GSH) was not observed due to decreases in cell viability.

Similarly displayed glycosylation motifs can serve as the basis for glyco-epitope mediated cross-reactivity by antibodies, which can have important implications on virus neutralization, antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection, and the interpretation of antibody titers in serological assays. From a panel of nine anti-HIV-1 gp120 reactive antibodies, we selected two (PGT126 and PGT128) that displayed high levels of cross-reactivity with the SARS-CoV-2 spike.

We aimed to develop an online platform that would serve as an open source repository for a curated subset of such models, and provide a simple interface for included models to allow for online calculation. This platform would support doctors during decision-making regarding diagnoses, prognoses, and follow-up of COVID-19 patients, expediting the models transition from research to clinical practice.

MethodsIn this proof-of-principle study, we performed a literature search in PubMed and WHO database to find suitable models for implementation on our platform. All selected models were publicly available (peer reviewed publications or open source repository) and had been validated (TRIPOD type 3 or 2b). We created a method for obtaining the regression coefficients if only the nomogram was available in the original publication. All predictive models were transcribed on a practical graphical user interface using PHP 8.0.0, and published online together with supporting documentation and links to the associated articles.

ResultsThe open source website https://covid19risk.ai/ currently incorporates nine models from six different research groups, evaluated on datasets from different countries. The website will continue to be populated with other models related to COVID-19 prediction as these become available. This dynamic platform allows COVID-19 researchers to contact us to have their model curated and included on our website, thereby increasing the reach and real-world impact of their work.

ConclusionWe have successfully demonstrated in this proof-of-principle study that our website provides an inclusive platform for predictive models related to COVID-19. It enables doctors to supplement their judgment with patient-specific predictions from externally-validated models in a user-friendly format.

It is proposed that heterogeneity among the vulnerable is a significant factor in the contagion impact of COVID-19, as demonstrated with incidence rates on a Diamond Princess Cruise ship in February 2020. Given the nature of the disease, its heterogeneity and human social norms, pre-voyage and post-voyage quick testing procedures may become the new standard for cruise ship passengers and crew. The technological advances in testing available today would facilitate more humanistic treatment as compared to more archaic quarantine and isolation practices for all onboard ship. With quick testing, identification of those infected and thus not allowed to embark on a cruise or quarantining those disembarking and other mitigation strategies, the popular cruise adventure could be available safely again. Whatever the procedures implemented, the methodological purpose of this study should add valuable insight in the modeling of disease and specifically, the COVID-19 virus.",1,141,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.06.425543v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.06.425543v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2021.01.06.425543.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Some viruses use specific packaging signals, which are conserved sequence/structure motifs present only in the full-length genome. Recent work has shown that viral proteins important for packaging can undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), where one or two viral nucleic acid binding proteins condense with the genome. The compositional simplicity of viral components lends itself well to theoretical modeling compared to more complex cellular organelles. Viral LLPS can be limited to one or two viral proteins and a single genome that is enriched in LLPS-promoting features. In our previous study, we observed that LLPS-promoting sequences of SARS-CoV-2 are located at the 5' and 3' ends of the genome, whereas the middle of the genome is predicted to consist mostly of solubilizing elements. Is this arrangement sufficient to drive single genome packaging, genome compaction, and genome cyclization? We addressed these questions using a coarse-grained polymer model, LASSI, to study the LLPS of nucleocapsid protein with RNA sequences that either promote LLPS or solubilization. With respect to genome cyclization, we find the most optimal arrangement restricts LLPS-promoting elements to the 5' and 3' ends of the genome, consistent with the native spatial patterning. Genome compaction is enhanced by clustered LLPS-promoting binding sites, while single genome packaging is most efficient when binding sites are distributed throughout the genome. These results suggest that many and variably positioned LLPS-promoting signals can support packaging in the absence of a singular packaging signal which argues against necessity of such a feature. We hypothesize that this model should be generalizable to multiple viruses as well as cellular organelles like paraspeckles, which enrich specific, long RNA sequences in a defined arrangement.

Statement of significanceThe COVID-19 pandemic has motivated research of the basic mechanisms of coronavirus replication. A major challenge faced by viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 is the selective packaging of a large genome in a relatively small capsid while excluding host and sub-genomic nucleic acids. Genomic RNA of SARS-CoV-2 can condense with the Nucleocapsid (N-protein), a structural protein component critical for packaging of many viruses. Notably, certain regions of the genomic RNA drive condensation of N-protein while other regions solubilize it. Here, we explore how the spatial patterning of these opposing elements promotes single genome compaction, packaging, and cyclization. This model informs future in silico experiments addressing spatial patterning of genomic features that are experimentally intractable because of the length of the genome.",1,34,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.06.425605v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.06.425605v2.full.pdf,_10.1101_2021.01.06.425605.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Single-cell transcriptomics unveiled the cellular identities of airway and alveolar tissue and the differentiation of WNThi cycling alveolar stem cells, a human-specific lung cell type4. These synthetic human lung buds are susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2 and endemic coronaviruses and can be used to track cell type-dependent susceptibilities to infection, intercellular transmission and cytopathology in airway and alveolar tissue in individual lung buds. Interestingly, we detected an increased susceptibility to infection in alveolar cells and identified cycling alveolar stem cells as targets of SARS-CoV-2. We used this platform to test neutralizing antibodies isolated from convalescent plasma that efficiently blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection and intercellular transmission.

As the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is cleaved into the S1 and the S2 domain by furin protease, Nrp1 binds to the newly created C-terminal RRAR amino acid sequence of the S1 domain. In this study, we model the association of a Nrp1 (a2-b1-b2) protein with the Spike protein computationally and analyze the topological constraints in the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein for binding with Nrp1 and ACE2. Importantly, we study the exit mechanism of S2 from the S1 domain with the assistance of ACE2 as well as Nrp1 by molecular dynamics pulling simulations. In the presence of Nrp1, by binding the S1 more strongly to the host membrane, there is a high probability of S2 being pulled out, rather than S1 being stretched. Thus, Nrp1 binding could stimulate the exit of S2 from the S1 domain, which will likely increase virus infectivity as the liberated S2 domain mediates the fusion of virus and host membranes.

Specifically, the N501Y mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 S1 receptor binding domain (RBD) domain has been shown to possess increased affinity for ACE2, although the basis for this not yet clear. Here, we dissect the mechanism underlying the increased affinity using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the available ACE2-S1-RBD complex structure (6M0J) and show a prolonged and stable interaction of the Y501 residue in the N501Y mutant S1-RBD with interfacial residues, Y41 and K353, in ACE2 as compared to the wild type S1-RBD.

The virus has been mutating and local transmission cases from different countries vary due to host dependent viral adaptation. Many distinct clusters of variant SARS CoV2 have been defined globally. In this study, the epidemiology of SARS CoV2 was studied and locally transmitted SARS CoV2 isolates from Karachi were sequenced to compared and identify any possible variants.The real time PCR was performed on nasopharyngeal specimen to confirm SARSCoV2 with Orf 1ab and E gene as targets. The viral sequencing was performed through oxford nanopore technology MinION platform. Isolates from first and second wave of COVID-19 outbreak in Karachi were compared. The overall positivity rate for PCR was 26.24% with highest number of positive cases in June. Approximately, 37.45% PCR positive subjects aged between 19-40 years. All the isolates belonged to GH clade and shared missense mutation D614G in spike protein linked to increased transmission rate worldwide. Another spike protein mutation A222V coexisted with D614G in the virus from second wave of COVID-19. Based on the present findings it is suggested that the locally transmitted virus from Karachi vary from those reported from other parts of Pakistan. Slight variability was also observed between viruses from first and second wave. Variability in any potential vaccine target may result in failed trials therefore information on any local viral variants is always useful for effective vaccine design and/or selection.

Authors summaryDespite precautionary measures the COVID-19 pandemic is causing deaths all over the world. The continuous mutations in viral genome is making it difficult to design vaccines. Variability in genome is host dependent and data sharing has revealed that variant for different geographical locations may harbor different mutations. Keeping this in mind the current study was focused on the epidemiology of SARS CoV2 in symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID -19 suspected cases with impact of age and gender. The locally transmitted SARS CoV2 isolates from Karachi were sequenced to compared and identify any possible variants. The sequenced viral genome varied from the already submitted sequences from Pakistan thereby confirming that slightly different viruses were causing infections during different time periods in Karachi. All belonged to GH clade with D614G, P323L and Q57H mutations. The virus from second wave had A222V mutation making it more different.

In this work we utilize molecular dynamics simulations to probe the flexibility and conformational ensemble of the unbound state of the receptor-binding domain from SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. We have found that the unbound RBD has a localized region of dynamic flexibility in Loop 3 and that mutations identified during the COVID-19 pandemic in Loop 3 do not affect this flexibility. We use a loop-modeling protocol to generate and simulate novel conformations of the CoV2-RBD Loop 3 region that sample conformational space beyond the ACE2 bound crystal structure.

During physiologic regeneration, AEC2s proliferate, exit the cell cycle, and transiently assume a transitional state before differentiating into AEC1s; transitional cells persist with ineffectual AEC1 differentiation in pulmonary fibrosis. It is unknown why transitional cells differentiate into AEC1s during physiologic regeneration but persist with ensuing scar in fibrosis and whether incomplete AEC1 differentiation from transitional cells without fibrosis may underlie prolonged respiratory failure in COVID-19 ARDS. Immunostaining of postmortem COVID-19 ARDS lungs revealed abundant transitional cells. They were typically cuboidal or partially spread, occasionally flat, but rarely expressed AEC1 markers. They formed organized monolayers on alveolar septa without fibrosis. Immunostaining and/or meta-analysis of scRNAseq datasets revealed that transitional cells in two mouse models of physiologic regeneration, COVID-19 ARDS, and fibrosis express markers of cell cycle exit but only in fibrosis express a specific senescence marker.

Theoretically, similar structure of nature polysaccharides may also have the impact on the virus. Indeed, some marine polysaccharide has been reported to inhibit SARS-Cov-2 infection in vitro, however the convinced targets and mechanism are still vague. By high throughput screening to target 3CLpro enzyme, a key enzyme that plays a pivotal role in the viral replication and transcription using nature polysaccharides library, we discover the mixture polysaccharide 375 from seaweed Ecklonia kurome Okam completely block 3Clpro enzymatic activity (IC50, 0.48 {micro}M). Further, the homogeneous polysaccharide 37502 from the 375 may bind to 3CLpro molecule well (kD value : 4.23 x 10-6). Very interestingly, 37502 also can potently disturb spike protein binding to ACE2 receptor (EC50, 2.01 {micro}M). Importantly, polysaccharide 375 shows good anti-SARS-CoV-2 infection activity in cell culture with EC50 values of 27 nM (99.9% inhibiting rate at the concentration of 20 {micro}g/mL), low toxicity (LD50: 136 mg/Kg on mice).

Bioactivity test show that 37501 and 37503 may impede SARS-Cov-2 infection and virus replication, however their individual impact on the virus is significantly less that of 375. Surprisingly, polysaccharide 37502 has no inhibition effect on SARS-Cov-2. The structure study based on monosaccharide composition, methylation, NMR spectrum analysis suggest that 375 contains guluronic acid, mannuronic acid, mannose, rhamnose, glucouronic acid, galacturonic acid, glucose, galactose, xylose and fucose with ratio of 1.86 : 9.56 : 6.81 : 1.69 : 1.00 : 1.75 : 1.19 : 11.06 : 4.31 : 23.06.

Efficacy is observed against the six viral families causing most human respiratory viral disease, irrespective of strain, including both influenza (FLUV) and SARS-CoV-2, with cell culture EC50 at or below 100 nM. Survival benefit is demonstrated in pigs against another member of family Coronaviridae, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), and shown equally effective in mild and severe disease. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) titer is reduced by drug treatment in cotton rats. A substantial barrier to viral resistance is demonstrated for FLUV. Drug resin affinity chromatography (DRAC) reveals a novel drug target: a multi-protein complex (MPC) formed transiently, in an energy-dependent fashion, and composed of host proteins implicated in both viral lifecycles and manipulation of innate immunity. The protein composition of this host MPC is modified upon viral infection, with increase or decrease of some proteins and appearance or complete loss of others. Valosin-containing protein, also known as Transitional endoplasmatic reticulum ATPase (VCP/p97), is present in the target MPC of uninfected cells and significantly increased in both FLUV and CoV infection. SQSTM1/p62, a key regulator of the autophagy pathway of innate immunity whose dysfunction is implicated in cytokine storm, is i) found in the target MPC from uninfected cells, ii) diminished in DRAC eluates by infection, and iii) restored by drug treatment of infected cells. 14-3-3 is one of likely several proteins that comprise the drug-binding site. Advanced compounds with improved pharmacokinetic (PK) properties and lung exposure are approaching criteria for a Target Product Profile. We propose these novel drug targets to comprise a previously unappreciated molecular basis for homeostasis that is modified by viruses to allow exploitation for viral propagation and is restored by treatment with the therapeutic compounds presented.

To assess whether human cortical cells can be directly infected by SARS-CoV-2, we utilized primary human cortical tissue and stem cell-derived cortical organoids. We find significant and predominant infection in cortical astrocytes in both primary and organoid cultures, with minimal infection of other cortical populations. Infected astrocytes had a corresponding increase in reactivity characteristics, growth factor signaling, and cellular stress. Although human cortical cells, including astrocytes, have minimal ACE2 expression, we find high levels of alternative coronavirus receptors in infected astrocytes, including DPP4 and CD147.

During transmission, host cell invasion is controlled by a large-scale conformational change of the Spike protein. This conformational rearrangement leads to membrane fusion, which creates transmembrane pores through which the viral genome is passed to the host. During Spike-protein-mediated fusion, the fusion peptides must be released from the core of the protein and associate with the host membrane. Interestingly, the Spike protein possesses many post-translational modifications, in the form of branched glycans that flank the surface of the assembly. Despite the large number of glycosylation sites, until now, the specific role of glycans during cell invasion has been unclear. Here, we propose that glycosylation is needed to provide sufficient time for the fusion peptides to reach the host membrane, otherwise the viral particle would fail to enter the host. To understand this process, an all-atom model with simplified energetics was used to perform thousands of simulations in which the protein transitions between the prefusion and postfusion conformations. These simulations indicate that the steric composition of the glycans induces a pause during the Spike protein conformational change. We additionally show that this glycan-induced delay provides a critical opportunity for the fusion peptides to capture the host cell. This previously-unrecognized role of glycans reveals how the glycosylation state can regulate infectivity of this pervasive pathogen.",1,202,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.18.427189v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.18.427189v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2021.01.18.427189.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

The study involved 17 explosives detection dogs, two cadaver detection dogs and two dogs with no previous detection training. Training lasted two weeks before starting the validation protocol. Sequential five and seven-cone line-ups were used with axillary sweat samples from symptomatic COVID-19 individuals (SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive) and from asymptomatic COVID-19 negative individuals (SARS-CoV-2 PCR negative). A total of 1368 trials were performed during validation, including 151 positive and 110 negative samples. Each line-up had one positive sample and at least one negative sample. The dog had to mark the positive sample, randomly positioned behind one of the cones. The dog, handler and data recorder were blinded to the positive sample location.

The calculated overall sensitivities were between 71% and 79% for three dogs, between83% and 87% for three other dogs, and equal to or higher than 90% for the remaining 15 dogs (more than two thirds of the 21 dogs).

The use of human lung tissue is one solution for the study of such novel respiratory pathogens. We hypothesized that a cryopreserved bank of human lung tissue allows for the in vitro study of the inter-individual heterogeneity of host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, thus providing a bridge between studies with cell lines and studies in animal models. We generated a cryobank of tissues from 16 donors, most of whom had risk factors for severe illness from COVID-19. Cryopreserved tissues preserved 90% of cell viability and contained heterogeneous populations of metabolically active epithelial, endothelial, and immune cell subsets of the human lung. Samples were readily infectible with HCoV-OC43 and SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus strains, and demonstrated comparable susceptibility to infection. In contrast, we observed a marked donor-dependent heterogeneity in the expression of IL-6, CXCL8 and IFN{beta} in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Treatment of tissues with dexamethasone and the experimental drug, N-hydroxycytidine, suppressed viral growth in all samples, whereas chloroquine and remdesivir had no detectable effect. Metformin and sirolimus, molecules with predicted antiviral activity, suppressed viral replication in tissues from a subset of donors. In summary, we developed a novel system for the in vitro study of human SARS-CoV-2 infection using primary human lung tissue from a library of donor tissues. This model may be useful for drug screening and for understanding basic mechanisms of COVID-19 pathogenesis.

ImportanceThe current biological systems for the study of COVID-19 are in vitro systems that differ from the human lung in many respects, and animal hosts to which the virus is not adapted. We developed another alternative for studying pathogenesis and drug susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 in a cryopreserved bank of human lung tissues. We consider the importance of this work to relate to the practical use of this culture system as a repeatable and scalable approach that allows for the study of an important infection in relevant tissues.

Although great progress has been made in the development of effective countermeasures, with several pharmaceutical companies approved or poised to deliver vaccines to market, there is still an unmet need of essential antiviral drugs with therapeutic impact for the treatment of moderate-to-severe COVID-19. Towards this goal, a high-throughput assay was used to screen SARS-CoV-2 nsp15 uracil-dependent endonuclease (endoU) function against 13 thousand compounds from drug and lead repurposing compound libraries. While over 80% of initial hit compounds were pan-assay inhibitory compounds, three hits were confirmed as nsp15 endoU inhibitors in the 1-20 M range in vitro. Furthermore, Exebryl-1, a {beta}-amyloid anti-aggregation molecule for Alzheimers therapy, was shown to have antiviral activity between 10 to 66 M, in VERO, Caco-2, and Calu-3 cells. Although the inhibitory concentrations determined for Exebryl-1 exceed those recommended for therapeutic intervention, our findings show great promise for further optimization of Exebryl-1 as an nsp15 endoU inhibitor and as a SARS-CoV-2 antiviral.

Author summaryDrugs to treat COVID-19 are urgently needed. To address this, we searched libraries of drugs and drug-like molecules for inhibitors of an essential enzyme of the virus that causes COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural protein (nsp)15. We found several molecules that inhibited the nsp15 enzyme function and one was shown to be active in inhibiting the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

In particular, we show that the differentially expressed genes consistently point to upregulation of type I Interferon signal pathway and downregulation of the mitochondrial genes, alongside several other reproducibly consistent changes.

It has been reported that the UK and South African strains may have higher transmission capabilities, eventually due to amino acid substitutions on the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. The pathogenicity seems modified but is still under investigation. Here we used the experimental structure of the Spike RBD domain co-crystallized with part of the ACE2 receptor and several in silico methods to analyze the possible impacts of three amino acid replacements (Spike K417N, E484K, N501Y) with regard to ACE2 binding. We found that the N501Y replacement in this region of the interface (present in both UK and South African strains) should be favorable for the interaction with ACE2 while the K417N and E484K substitutions (South African) would seem unfavorable. It is unclear if the N501Y substitution in the South African strain could counterbalance the predicted less favorable (regarding binding) K417N and E484K Spike replacements. Our finding suggests that, if indeed the South African strain has a high transmission level, this could be due to the N501Y replacement and/or to substitutions in regions outside the direct Spike-ACE2 interface.

Our work demonstrates that the spike Receptor Binding Domain (RBD), Main protease (Mpro), and nonstructural protein 3 (macro X) possesses extreme thermos-stability when subjected to temperature variations rendering them attractive drug targets. Furthermore, our findings suggest that these four proteins are well adapted to habitable temperatures on earth and are largely insensitive to cold and warm climates. Furthermore, we report that the critical residues in SARS-CoV-2 RBD were less responsive to temperature variations as compared to the critical residues in SARS-CoV.

The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with mutations in the spike protein, most recently circulating isolates from the United Kingdom (B.1.1.7) and Republic of South Africa (B.1.351), has led to lower neutralization from convalescent serum by pseudovirus neutralization (PsVN) assays and resistance to certain monoclonal antibodies. Here, using two orthogonal VSV and lentivirus PsVN assays expressing spike variants of 20E (EU1), 20A.EU2, D614G-N439, mink cluster 5, B.1.1.7, and B.1.351 variants, we assessed the neutralizing capacity of sera from human subjects or non-human primates (NHPs) that received mRNA-1273. No significant impact on neutralization against the B.1.1.7 variant was detected in either case, however reduced neutralization was measured against the mutations present in B.1.351.

In this study, we report on the evolution of the overall humoral immune responses on 101 blood samples obtained from 32 COVID-19 convalescent patients between 16 and 233 days post-symptom onset.

Concomitantly, the frequencies of RBD-specific IgM+ B cells wane significantly when compared to RBD-specific IgG+ B cells, which increase over time, and the number of IgG+ memory B cells which remain stable thereafter for up to 8 months after symptoms onset. With the recent approval of highly effective vaccines for COVID-19, data on the persistence of immune responses are of central importance.

Analysis of the type I interferon-inducible transcription factor sub-networks as distinct protein-protein interaction pathways revealed insights into the role of critical hubs in signaling. Interrogation of multiple microarray datasets revealed that SARS-CoV-2 induced high levels of IFN-beta and interferon-inducible transcription factor mRNA in human lung epithelial cells. Transcription factor mRNA of the three major sub-networks regulating antiviral, immune modulation, and cell growth were differentially regulated in human lung epithelial cell lines after SARS-CoV-2 infection and in the tissue samples of COVID-19 patients. A subset of type I interferon-inducible transcription factors and inflammatory mediators were specifically enriched in the lungs and neutrophils of COVID-19 patients. The emerging complex picture of type I IFN transcriptional regulation consists of a rapid transcriptional switch mediated by the Jak-Stat cascade and a graded output of the inducible transcription factor activation that enables temporal regulation of gene expression.",1,23,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.25.428122v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.25.428122v2.full.pdf,_10.1101_2021.01.25.428122.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Hamsters are the only model that reliably exhibit more severe SARS-CoV-2 disease similar to hospitalized patients, making them pertinent for vaccine evaluation. We demonstrate that prime or prime-boost administration of mRNA-1273 in hamsters elicited robust neutralizing antibodies, ameliorated weight loss, suppressed SARS-CoV-2 replication in the airways, and better protected against disease at the highest prime-boost dose.

Surprisingly, infection triggered transcriptome programs in some types of immune cells from vaccinated hamsters that were shared, albeit attenuated, with mock-vaccinated hamsters.

The development of a unified view and a working model which is consistent with the diverse experimental data is an important focal point of the current work. In this study, we used an integrative computational approach to examine molecular mechanisms underlying functional effects of the D614G mutation by exploring atomistic modeling of the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins as allosteric regulatory machines. We combined coarse-grained simulations, protein stability and dynamic fluctuation communication analysis along with network-based community analysis to simulate structures of the native and mutant SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins in different functional states. The results demonstrated that the D614 position anchors a key regulatory cluster that dictates functional transitions between open and closed states. Using molecular simulations and mutational sensitivity analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins we showed that the D614G mutation can improve stability of the spike protein in both closed and open forms, but shifting thermodynamic preferences towards the open mutant form. The results offer support to the reduced shedding mechanism of S1 domain as a driver of the increased infectivity triggered by the D614G mutation. Through distance fluctuations communication analysis, we probed stability and allosteric communication propensities of protein residues in the native and mutant SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, providing evidence that the D614G mutation can enhance long-range signaling of the allosteric spike engine. By employing network community analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, our results revealed that the D614G mutation can promote the increased number of stable communities and allosteric hub centers in the open form by reorganizing and enhancing the stability of the S1-S2 inter-domain interactions and restricting mobility of the S1 regions. This study provides atomistic-based view of the allosteric interactions and communications in the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, suggesting that the D614G mutation can exert its primary effect through allosterically induced changes on stability and communications in the residue interaction networks.",1,173,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.26.428331v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.26.428331v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2021.01.26.428331.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

However, it is not known if combination RDV/mAb will improve outcomes over single agent therapies or whether antibody therapies will remain efficacious against variants.

The same antibody combination was also effective in prevention and therapy against the B.1.351 variant of concern (VOC). Combining RDV and antibodies provided a modest improvement in outcomes compared to single agents.

The identity of these rMCs is still elusive. Among them, Axin2Pos mesenchymal alveolar niche cells (MANCs), which are expressing Fgf7, have been previously described. We propose that an additional population of rMCs, expressing Fgf10 (called rMC-Sca1PosFgf10Pos) are equally important to maintain AT2 stem cell self-renewal.

The alveolosphere model, based on the AT2-rMC co-culture in growth factor reduced Matrigel, was used to test the efficiency of different rMC subpopulations isolated by FACS from adult murine lung to sustain the self-renewal and differentiation of AT2 stem cells.

We demonstrate that rMC-Sca1PosFgf10Pos cells are efficient to promote the self-renewal and differentiation of AT2 stem cells. Co-staining of adult lung for Fgf10 mRNA and Sftpc protein respectively, indicate that 28% of Fgf10Pos cells are located close to AT2 cells. Co-ISH for Fgf7 and Fgf10 indicate that these two populations do not significantly overlap. Gene arrays comparing rMC-Sca1PosAxin2Pos and rMC-Sca1PosFgf10Pos support that these two cell subsets express differential markers. In addition, rMC function is decreased in diabetic and obese ob/ob mutant compared to WT mice with a much stronger loss of function in males compared to females.

In conclusion, rMC-Sca1PosFgf10Pos cells play important role in supporting AT2 stem cells self-renewal and differentiation. This result sheds a new light on the subpopulations of rMCs contributing to the AT2 stem cell niche in homeostasis and in the context of COVID-19 pathogenesis.

Key messageO_ST_ABSWhat is already known about the subject?C_ST_ABSResident mesenchymal cells (rMCs defined as Cd31NegCd45NegEpcamNeg) control the self-renewal and differentiation of alveolar epithelial type 2 (AT2) stem cells in vitro. The identity of these rMCs is still elusive. Among them, Axin2Pos mesenchymal alveolar niche cells (MANCs), which are expressing Fgf7, have been previously described.

What does this study add?Our study shows that an additional population of rMCs, expressing Fgf10 (called rMC-Sca1PosFgf10Pos) is equally important to maintain AT2 stem cell self-renewal. rMC-Sca1PosFgf10Pos are LipidToxHigh and are located close to AT2s. In addition, rMC-Sca1PosFgf10Pos cells support AT2 stem cell self-renewal and differentiation thereby identifying these cells as bone fide functional lipofibroblasts (LIFs). We have previously reported that LIF can transdifferentiate into activated MYF in the context of bleomycin-induced fibrosis in mice [1] and that activated MYF isolated from the lungs of end stage idiopathic fibrosis human patients can respond to Metformin to undergo transdifferentiation back to the LIF phenotype [2]. We also show that the function of rMCs-Sca1Pos is negatively impacted by gender and obesity, which represent two major aggravating factors for COVID-19 pathogenesis, leading to either death or major complications after infection recovery such as lung fibrosis.

How might this impact on clinical practice and future development?By establishing that rMC-Sca1PosFgf10Pos are different from the MANCs, our study opens the way for a new key mesenchymal cell population that should be targeted to either prevent or reverse fibrosis. In addition, as this population maintains the AT2 stem cells self-renewal and differentiation, such targeting will also allow to progressively recover the loss in respiratory function.",1,124,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.28.428090v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.28.428090v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2021.01.28.428090.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Using computational modeling approach, this study resolved the evolutionary pattern of bonding affinity of ACE2 in 247 jawed vertebrates to the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2. First, high-or-low binding affinity phenotype divergence of ACE2 to the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 has appeared in two ancient species of jawed vertebrates, Scyliorhinus torazame (low-affinity, Chondrichthyes) and Latimeria chalumnae (high-affinity, Coelacanthimorpha). Second, multiple independent affinity divergence events recur in fishes, amphibians-reptiles, birds, and mammals. Third, high affinity phenotypes go up in mammals, possibly implying the rapid expansion of mammals might accelerate the evolution of coronaviruses. Fourth, we found natural mutations at eight amino acid sites of ACE2 can determine most of phenotype divergences of bonding affinity in 247 vertebrates and resolved their related structural basis. Moreover, we also identified high-affinity or low-affinity-associated concomitant mutation group.The group linked to extremely high affinity may provide novel potentials for the development of human recombinant soluble ACE2 (hrsACE2) in treating patients with COVID-19 or for constructing genetically modified SARS-CoV-2 infection models promoting vaccines studies.

In this study, we have screened a panel of naturally occurring and semi-synthetic oxysterol derivatives for anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity, using a cell culture infection assay.

Recent epidemiological studies suggested that some environmental factors, such as air pollution, might be the important contributors to the mortality of COVID-19. However, how environmental exposure enhances the severity of COVID-19 remains to be fully understood. In the present report, we provide evidence showing that mdig, a previously reported environmentally-induced oncogene that antagonizes repressive trimethylation of histone proteins, is a master regulator for SARS-CoV-2 receptors neuropilin-1 (NRP1) and NRP2, cathepsins, glycan metabolism and inflammation, key determinants for viral infection and cytokine storm of the patients. Depletion of mdig in bronchial epithelial cells by CRISPR-Cas-9 gene editing resulted in a decreased expression of NRP1, NRP2, cathepsins, and genes involved in protein glycosylation and inflammation, largely due to a substantial enrichment of lysine 9 and/or lysine 27 trimethylation of histone H3 (H3K9me3/H3K27me3) on these genes as determined by ChIP-seq. These data, accordingly, suggest that mdig is a key mediator for the severity of COVID-19 in response to environmental exposure and targeting mdig may be one of the effective strategies in ameliorating the symptom and reducing the mortality of COVID-19.",1,143,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.31.429010v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.31.429010v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2021.01.31.429010.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Progress and PotentialTo address the global challenge of creating treatments for SARS-CoV-2 infection, we devised a nanomedicine termed ""Nanotraps"" that can completely capture and eliminate the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike (S) glycoprotein is a major immunogenic and protective protein, and plays a crucial role in viral pathogenesis. In this study, we successfully constructed a synthetic codon-optimized DNA-based vaccine as a countermeasure against SARS-CoV-2; denoted as VIU-1005. The design was based on the synthesis of codon-optimized coding sequence for optimal mammalian expression of a consensus full-length S glycoprotein. The successful construction of the vaccine was confirmed by restriction digestion and sequencing, and the protein expression of the S protein was confirmed by western blot and immunofluorescence staining in mammalian cells. The immunogenicity of the vaccine was tested in two mouse models (BALB/c and C57BL/6J). Th1-skewed systemic S-specific IgG antibodies and neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) were significantly induced in both models four weeks post three injections with 100 g of the VIU-1005 vaccine via intramuscular needle injection but not intradermal or subcutaneous routes. Importantly, such immunization induced long-lasting IgG response in mice that lasted for at least 6 months. Interestingly, using a needle-free system, we showed an enhanced immunogenicity of VIU-1005 in which lower doses such as 25-50 g or less number of doses were able to elicit significantly high levels of Th1-biased systemic S-specific IgG antibodies and nAbs via intramuscular immunization compared to needle immunization. Compared to the intradermal needle injection which failed to induce any significant immune response, intradermal needle-free immunization elicited robust Th1-biased humoral response similar to that observed with intramuscular immunization. Furthermore, immunization with VIU-1005 induced potent S-specific cellular response as demonstrated by the significantly high levels of IFN-{gamma}, TNF and IL-2 cytokines production in memory CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in BALB/c mice. Together, our results demonstrate that the synthetic VIU-1005 candidate DNA vaccine is highly immunogenic and capable of inducing long-lasting and Th1-skewed immune response in mice. Furthermore, we show that the use of needle-free system could enhance the immunogenicity and minimize doses needed to induce protective immunity in mice, supporting further preclinical and clinical testing of this candidate vaccine.",1,152,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.01.429219v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.01.429219v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2021.02.01.429219.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

The virus genomes have been broadly evolving due to the high number of infected hosts world-wide. Mutagenesis and selection are the two inter-dependent mechanisms of virus diversification. However, which mechanisms contribute to the mutation profiles of SARS-CoV-2 remain under-explored. Here, we delineate the contribution of mutagenesis and selection to the genome diversity of SARS-CoV-2 isolates. We generated a comprehensive phylogenetic tree with representative genomes. Instead of counting mutations relative to the reference genome, we identified each mutation event at the nodes of the phylogenetic tree. With this approach, we obtained the mutation events that are independent of each other and generated the mutation profile of SARS-CoV-2 genomes. The results suggest that the heterogeneous mutation patterns are mainly reflections of host (i) antiviral mechanisms that are achieved through APOBEC, ADAR, and ZAP proteins and (ii) probable adaptation against reactive oxygen species.

Emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants show increased infectivity and may lead to resistance against immune responses of previously immunized individuals or existing therapeutics, especially antibody-based therapies.

Several monoclonal antibody therapeutics authorized for emergency use or in development start to lose potency against various SARS-CoV-2 variants. Cocktails of two different monoclonal antibodies constitute a promising approach to protect against such variants as long as both antibodies are potent, but come with increased development complexity and therefore cost. As an alternative, we developed two multi-specific DARPin(R) therapeutics, each combining three independent DARPin(R) domains binding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in one molecule, to potently neutralize the virus and overcome virus escape.

Here, we show in a panel of in vitro studies that both multi-specific DARPin(R) therapeutics, ensovibep (MP0420) and MP0423, are highly potent against the new circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7 (UK variant) and B.1.351 (South African variant) and the most frequent emerging mutations in the spike protein. Additionally, viral passaging experiments show potent protection by ensovibep and MP0423 against development of escape mutations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the cooperative binding of the individual modules in a multi-specific DARPin(R) antiviral is key for potent virus inhibition and protection from escape variants. These results, combined with the relatively small size and high production yields of DARPin(R) molecules, suggests ensovibep and MP0423 as superior alternatives to monoclonal antibody cocktails for global supply and demonstrate the strength of the DARPin(R) platform for achieving potent and lasting virus inhibition for SARS-CoV-2 and possibly other viruses.",1,147,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.03.429164v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.03.429164v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2021.02.03.429164.txt,1,field-specific repository,0,in order to visualize all muta�ons loops 518-520 676-689 811-813 and regions of the ntd domain missing in the cryo-em structure were modelled with modeller included in the biovia discovery studio so�ware using the pdb ﬁle 6zge as template for the ntd domain (biovia dassault systèmes biovia discovery studio 2021).   biorxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.03.429164; this version posted february 3 2021.,NA

Combined differences in antibody effector functions and neutralization were strongly associated with distinct levels of protection in the upper and lower respiratory tract, pointing to the presence of combined, but distinct, compartment-specific neutralization and Fc-mechanisms as key determinants of protective immunity against infection. Moreover, NVX-CoV2373 elicited antibodies functionally target emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, collectively pointing to the critical collaborative role for Fab and Fc in driving maximal protection against SARS-CoV-2. Collectively, the data presented here suggest that a single dose may prevent disease, but that two doses may be essential to block further transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and emerging variants.

The immune response is induced through the production of EVs incorporating Nefmut-derivatives released by muscle cells. In the perspective to a possible translation into the clinic of the Nefmut-based vaccine platform, we aimed at increasing its safety profile by identifying the minimal part of Nefmut retaining the EV-anchoring protein property. We found that a C-terminal deletion of 29-amino acids did not affect the ability of Nefmut to associate with EVs. Furthermore, the EV-anchoring function was preserved when antigens from both HPV16 (i.e., E6 and E7) and SARS-CoV-2 (i.e., S1 and S2) were fused to its C-terminus. By analyzing the immune responses induced after intramuscular injection of DNA vectors expressing fusion products based on the four viral antigens, we found that the Nefmut C-terminal deletion did not impact on the levels of antigen -specific CD8+ T lymphocytes as evaluated by IFN-{gamma} EliSpot analysis and intracellular cytokine staining. In addition, immune responses at distal sites remained unaffected, as indicated by the similar percentages of SARS-CoV-2 S1- and S2-specific CD8+ T cells detected in spleens and lung airways of mice injected with DNA vectors expressing the viral antigens fused with either Nefmut or NefmutPL.

We concluded that the C-terminal Nefmut truncation does not affect stability, EV-anchoring, and CD8+ T cell immunogenicity of the fused antigen.

Especially, the variant B.1.351 in South Africa with the hallmark of triple mutations (N501Y, K417N and E484K) is worrisome. Quickly after the outbreak of this new variant, several studies showed that both N501Y and E484K can enhance the binding between RBD and the human ACE2 receptor. However, the mutation K417N seems to be unfavorable because it removes one interfacial salt-bridge. So far, it is still not well understood why the K417N mutation is selected in the viral evolution. Here, we show that despite the loss in the binding affinity (1.48 kcal/mol) between RBD and ACE2 the K417N mutation abolishes a buried interfacial salt-bridge between RBD and the neutralizing antibody CB6 and thus substantially reduces their binding energy by 9.59 kcal/mol, facilitating the variants to efficiently elude CB6 (as well as many other antibodies). Thus, when proliferating from person to person the virus might have adapted to the human immune system through evasive mutations. Taking into account limited and relevant experimental works in the field, we show that our theoretical predictions are consistent with existing experimental findings. By harnessing the revealed molecular mechanism for variants, it becomes feasible to redesign therapeutic antibodies accordingly to make them more efficacious.

Our results show that the total local topological free energy of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein monotonically decreases from pre-to post-fusion and that its distribution along the protein domains is related to their activity in protein rearrangement. By using density functional theory (DFT) calculations with inclusion of solvent effects, we show that high local topological free energy conformations are unstable compared to those of low topological free energy.

Loss of biodiversity and our connectedness to nature, along with poor microbial literacy may be augmenting the negative consequences of germaphobia on ecosystem health. In this study, we created an online questionnaire to acquire data on attitudes towards, and knowledge of microbes. We collected data on nature connectedness and interactions with nature and explored the relationships between these variables. We found a significant association between attitudes towards microbes and both duration and frequency of visits to natural environments. A higher frequency of visits to nature per week, and a longer duration spent in nature per visit, significantly associated with positive attitudes towards microbes. We found no association between nature connectedness and attitudes towards microbes. We found a significant relationship between knowledge of  lesser known microbial groups (e.g., identifying that fungi, algae, protozoa, and archaea are microbes) and positive attitudes towards microbes. However, we also found that people who correctly identified viruses as being microbes expressed less positive views of microbes overall -- this could potentially be attributed to a  COVID-19 effect. Our results suggest that basic microbial literacy and nature engagement may be important in reducing/preventing germaphobia. The results also suggest that a virus-centric phenomenon (e.g., COVID-19) could increase broader germaphobia. As the rise of immune-related disorders and mental health conditions have been linked to germaphobia, reduced biodiversity, and non-targeted sterilisation, our findings point to a feasible strategy to potentially help ameliorate these negative consequences. A greater emphasis on microbial literacy and promoting time spent in nature could be useful in promoting resilience in human health and more positive/constructive attitudes towards the foundations of our ecosystems - the microorganisms.",1,80,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.08.430200v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.08.430200v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2021.02.08.430200.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

We speculated that exosomes as extracellular vesicles are secreted from SARS-CoV-2 infected cells may transport messages to other cells of distant organs leading to pathogenic consequences. For this, we took an unbiased proteomic approach for analyses of exosomes isolated from plasma of healthy volunteers and SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Our results revealed that tenascin-C (TNC) and fibrinogen-{beta} (FGB) are highly abundant in exosomes from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients plasma as compared to that of healthy normal controls. Since TNC and FGB stimulate pro-inflammatory cytokines via NF-{kappa}B pathway, we examined the status of TNF-, IL-6 and CCL5 expression upon exposure of hepatocytes to exosomes from COVID-19 patients and observed significant increase when compared with that from healthy subjects. Together, our results demonstrated that soluble mediators, like TNC and FGB, are transported through plasma exosomes in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients and trigger pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in cells of distant organs in COVID-19 patients.

ImportanceExosomes play an important role in intercellular communication by inducing physiological changes in recipient cells by transferring bioactive proteins.

Disruption in our ability to detect odors, or anosmia, has emerged as a hallmark symptom of infection with SARS-CoV-2, yet the mechanism behind this abrupt sensory deficit remains elusive. Here, using molecular evaluation of human olfactory epithelium (OE) from subjects succumbing to COVID-19 and a hamster model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we discovered widespread downregulation of olfactory receptors (ORs) as well as key components of their signaling pathway. OR downregulation likely represents a non-cell autonomous effect, since SARS-CoV-2 detection in OSNs is extremely rare both in human and hamster OEs. A likely explanation for the reduction of OR transcription is the striking reorganization of nuclear architecture observed in the OSN lineage, which disrupts multi-chromosomal compartments regulating OR expression in humans and hamsters.

Accordingly, there is a need for new approaches to limit severe illness stemming from coronavirus infections. Cells of the immune system and lung epithelia express receptors for GABA (GABA-Rs), a widely used neurotransmitter within the CNS. GABA-R agonists have anti-inflammatory effects and can limit acute lung injury. We previously showed that GABA treatment effectively reduced disease severity and death rates in mice following infection with a coronavirus (MHV-1) which provides a potentially lethal model of COVID-19. Here, we report that GABA treatment also reduced viral load in the lungs, suggesting that GABA-Rs may provide a new druggable target to limit pulmonary coronavirus replication.

Herein we describe an ACE2-lentivirus system and illustrate its utility for in vitro and in vivo SARS-CoV-2 infection models. Transduction of non-permissive cell lines with hACE2 imparted replication competence, and transduction with mACE2 containing N30D, N31K, F83Y and H353K substitutions, to match hACE2, rescued SARS-CoV-2 replication. Intranasal hACE2-lentivirus transduction of C57BL/6J mice permitted significant virus replication in lungs. RNA-Seq analyses illustrated that the model involves an acute inflammatory disease followed by resolution and tissue repair, with a transcriptomic profile similar to that seen in COVID-19 patients. Intranasal hACE2-lentivirus transduction of IFNAR-/- and IL-28RA-/- mice lungs was used to illustrate that loss of type I or III interferon responses have no significant effect on virus replication. However, their importance in driving inflammatory responses was illustrated by RNA-Seq analyses. We also demonstrate the utility of the hACE2-lentivirus transduction system for vaccine evaluation in C57BL/6J mice. The ACE2-lentivirus system thus has broad application in SARS-CoV-2 research, providing a tool for both mutagenesis studies and mouse model development.

AUTHOR SUMMARYSARS-CoV-2 uses the human ACE2 (hACE2) receptor to infect cells, but cannot infect mice because the virus cannot bind mouse ACE2 (mACE2). We use an ACE2-lentivirus system in vitro to identify four key amino acids in mACE2 that explain why SARS-CoV-2 cannot infect mice. hACE2-lentivirus was used to express hACE2 in mouse lungs in vivo, with the inflammatory responses after SARS-CoV-2 infection similar to those seen in human COVID-19. Genetically modified mice were used to show that type I and III interferon signaling is required for the inflammatory responses. We also show that the hACE2-lentivirus mouse model can be used to test vaccines. Overall this paper demonstrates that our hACE2-lentivirus system has multiple applications in SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 research.",1,48,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.09.430547v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.09.430547v3.full.pdf,_10.1101_2021.02.09.430547.txt,1,"field-specific repository, data availability statement",0,418 419  data availability  420  all raw sequencing data (fastq files) are available from the sequence read archive (sra) bioproject  421  accession: prjna701678.      data availability  420  all raw sequencing data (fastq files) are available from the sequence read archive (sra) bioproject  421  accession: prjna701678,NA

The Allen Institute for AI and collaborators announced the availability of a rapidly growing open dataset of publications, the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19). As the pace of research accelerates, biomedical scientists struggle to stay current. To expedite their investigations, scientists leverage hypothesis generation systems, which can automatically inspect published papers to discover novel implicit connections. We present an automated general purpose hypothesis generation systems AGATHA-C and AGATHA-GP for COVID-19 research. The systems are based on graph-mining and the transformer model. The systems are massively validated using retrospective information rediscovery and proactive analysis involving human-in-the-loop expert analysis. Both systems achieve high-quality predictions across domains (in some domains up to 0.97% ROC AUC) in fast computational time and are released to the broad scientific community to accelerate biomedical research. In addition, by performing the domain expert curated study, we show that the systems are able to discover on-going research findings such as the relationship between COVID-19 and oxytocin hormone.

Viral replication and assembly are entirely dependent on two viral cysteine proteases: 3C-like protease (3CLpro) and the papain-like protease (PLpro). PLpro also has deubiquitinase (DUB) activity, removing ubiquitin (Ub) and Ub-like modifications from host proteins, disrupting the host immune response. 3CLpro is inhibited by many known cysteine protease inhibitors, whereas PLpro is a relatively unusual cysteine protease, being resistant to blockade by such inhibitors. A high-throughput screen of biased and unbiased libraries gave a low hit rate, identifying only CPI-169 and the positive control, GRL0617, as inhibitors with good potency (IC50 < 10 {micro}M). Analogues of both inhibitors were designed to develop structure-activity relationships; however, without a co-crystal structure of the CPI-169 series, we focused on GRL0617 as a starting point for structure-based drug design, obtaining several co-crystal structures to guide optimization. A series of novel 2-phenylthiophene-based non-covalent SARS-CoV-2 PLpro inhibitors were obtained, culminating in low nanomolar potency. The high potency and slow inhibitor off-rate were rationalized by newly identified ligand interactions with a ""BL2 groove"" that is distal from the active site cysteine. Trapping of the conformationally flexible BL2 loop by these inhibitors blocks binding of viral and host protein substrates; however, until now it has not been demonstrated that this mechanism can induce potent and efficacious antiviral activity. In this study, we report that novel PLpro inhibitors have excellent antiviral efficacy and potency against infectious SARS-CoV-2 replication in cell cultures.

Our study provides critical insights for further improvement of HIV subunit trimer vaccines for future rounds of the iterative vaccine design process.",1,102,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.16.431310v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.16.431310v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2021.02.16.431310.txt,1,field-specific repository,0,negative stain electron microscopy reconstruction has been deposited in the electron microscopy databank (accession number: emd-23373).  14   biorxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.16.431310; this version posted february 17 2021.,NA

Though clustering of cellular transcriptomes is the default technique for defining cell types and subtypes, single cell clustering can be strongly influenced by technical variation. In fact, the prevalent unsupervised clustering algorithms can cluster cells by technical, rather than biological, variation.

ResultsCompared to de novo (unsupervised) clustering methods, we demonstrate using multiple benchmarks that supervised clustering, which uses reference transcriptomes as a guide, is robust to batch effects. To leverage the advantages of supervised clustering, we present RCA2, a new, scalable, and broadly applicable version of our RCA algorithm. RCA2 provides a user-friendly framework for supervised clustering and downstream analysis of large scRNA-seq data sets. RCA2 can be seamlessly incorporated into existing algorithmic pipelines. It incorporates various new reference panels for human and mouse, supports generation of custom panels and uses efficient graph-based clustering and sparse data structures to ensure scalability. We demonstrate the applicability of RCA2 on SC data from human bone marrow, healthy PBMCs and PBMCs from COVID-19 patients. Importantly, RCA2 facilitates cell-type-specific QC, which we show is essential for accurate clustering of SC data from heterogeneous tissues. In the era of cohort-scale SC analysis, supervised clustering methods such as RCA2 will facilitate unified analysis of diverse SC datasets.

The progress in the developments of effective vaccines and neutralizing antibody therapeutics brings hopes to eliminate the threat of COVID-19. However, SARS-CoV-2 continues to mutate, and several new variants have been emerged. Among the various naturally-occurring mutations, the E484K mutation shared by both the 501Y.V2 and 501Y.V3 variants attracted serious concerns, which may potentially enhance the receptor binding affinity and reduce the immune response. In the present study, the molecular mechanism behind the impacts of E484K mutation on the binding affinity of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) with the receptor human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) was investigated by using the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations combined with the molecular mechanics-generalized Born surface area (MMGBSA) method. Our results indicate that the E484K mutation results in more favorable electrostatic interactions compensating the burial of the charged and polar groups upon the binding of RBD with hACE2, which significantly improves the RBD-hACE2 binding affinity. Besides that, the E484K mutation also causes the conformational rearrangements of the loop region containing the mutant residue, which leads to more tight binding interface of RBD with hACE2 and formation of some new hydrogen bonds. The more tight binding interface and the new hydrogen bonds formation also contribute to the improved binding affinity of RBD to the receptor hACE2. In addition, six neutralizing antibodies and nanobodies complexed with RBD were selected to explore the effects of E484K mutation on the recognition of these antibodies to RBD. The simulation results show that the E484K mutation significantly reduces the binding affinities to RBD for most of the studied neutralizing antibodies, and the decrease in the binding affinities is mainly owing to the unfavorable electrostatic interactions caused by the mutation. Our studies revealed that the E484K mutation may improve the binding affinity between RBD and the receptor hACE2, implying more transmissibility of the E484K-containing variants, and weaken the binding affinities between RBD and the studied neutralizing antibodies, indicating reduced effectiveness of these antibodies. Our results provide valuable information for the effective vaccine development and antibody drugs design.",1,90,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.17.431566v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.17.431566v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2021.02.17.431566.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Using 227 plasma samples from COVID-19 patients, we showed that SARS-CoV-2 NTD-specific antibodies could be induced during infection. As compared to the serological response to SARS-CoV-2 RBD, the SARS-CoV-2 NTD response is less cross-reactive with SARS-CoV. Furthermore, neutralizing antibodies are rarely elicited in a mice model when NTD is used as an immunogen. We subsequently demonstrate that NTD has an altered antigenicity when expressed alone.

One consequence is oxidation of the ryanodine receptor/calcium (Ca2+) release channels (RyR) on the endo/sarcoplasmic (ER/SR) reticuli in heart, lung and brains of patients who succumbed to COVID-19. This depletes the channels of the stabilizing subunit calstabin2 causing them to leak Ca2+ which can promote heart failure4,5, pulmonary insufficiency 6 and cognitive and behavioral defects7-9. Ex-vivo treatment of heart, lung, and brain tissues from COVID-19 patients using a Rycal drug (ARM210)10 prevented calstabin2 loss and fixed the channel leak. Of particular interest is that neuropathological pathways activated downstream of leaky RyR2 channels in Alzheimers Disease (AD) patients were activated in COVID-19 patients.

The introduction of live oral rotavirus vaccines has reduced the incidence of rotavirus disease in many countries. To explore the possibility of establishing a combined rotavirus-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, we generated recombinant (r)SA11 rotaviruses with modified segment 7 RNAs that contained coding sequences for NSP3 and FLAG-tagged portions of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. A 2A translational element was used to drive separate expression of NSP3 and the S product. rSA11 viruses were recovered that encoded the S-protein S1 fragment, N-terminal domain (NTD), receptor-binding domain (RBD), extended receptor-binding domain (ExRBD), and S2 core (CR) domain (rSA11/NSP3-fS1, -fNTD, -fRBD, -fExRBD, and -fCR, respectively). Generation of rSA11/fS1 required a foreign-sequence insertion of 2.2-kbp, the largest such insertion yet made into the rotavirus genome. Based on isopycnic centrifugation, rSA11 containing S sequences were denser than wildtype virus, confirming the capacity of the rotavirus to accommodate larger genomes. Immunoblotting showed that rSA11/-fNTD, -fRBD, -fExRBD, and -fCR viruses expressed S products of expected size, with fExRBD expressed at highest levels. These rSA11 viruses were genetically stable during serial passage. In contrast, rSA11/NSP3-fS1 failed to express its expected 80-kDa fS1 product, for unexplained reasons. Moreover, rSA11/NSP3-fS1 was genetically unstable, with variants lacking the S1 insertion appearing during serial passage. Nonetheless, these results emphasize the potential usefulness of rotavirus vaccines as expression vectors of portions of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein (e.g., NTD, RBD, ExRBD, and CR) with sizes smaller than the S1 fragment.

ImportanceAmong the vaccines administered to children in the US and many other countries are those targeting rotavirus, a segmented double-stranded RNA virus that is a major cause of severe gastroenteritis.

Strikingly, we detected many accumulating Single Nucleotide Variations (SNVs) encoding amino acid changes in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, with a pattern indicative of RNA editing enzymes as major mutators of SARS-CoV-2 genomes. We report three major variants through October of 2020. These revealed 14 key mutations that were found in various combinations among 14 distinct predominant signatures. These signatures likely represent evolutionary lineages of SARS-CoV-2 in the U.S. and reveal clues to its evolution such as a mutational burst in the summer of 2020 likely leading to a homegrown new variant, and a trend towards higher mutational load among viral isolates, but with occasional mutation loss. The last quartile of 2020 revealed a concerning accumulation of mostly novel low frequency replacement mutations in the Spike protein, and a hypermutable glutamine residue near the putative furin cleavage site. Finally, the end of the year data revealed the presence of known variants of concern including B.1.1.7, which has acquired additional Spike mutations. Overall, our results suggest that predominant viral sequences are dynamically evolving over time, with periods of mutational bursts and unabated mutation accumulation. This high level of existing variation, even at low frequencies and especially in the Spike-encoding region may be become problematic when superspreader events, akin to serial Founder Events in evolution, drive these rare mutations to prominence.

AUTHOR SUMMARYThe pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has caused the death of more than 2.29 million people and continues to be a severe threat internationally. Although simple measures such as social distancing, periodic lockdowns and hygiene protocols were immediately put into force, the infection rates were only temporarily minimized. When infection rates exploded again new variants of the virus began to emerge. Our study focuses on a representative set of sequences from the United States throughout 2020 and early 2021. We show that the driving force behind the variants of public health concern, is widespread infection and superspreader events. In particular, we show accumulation of mutations over time with little loss from genetic drift, including in the Spike region, which could be problematic for vaccines and therapies. This lurking accumulated genetic variation may be a superspreader event from becoming more common and lead to variants that can escape the immune protection provided by the existing vaccines.",1,115,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.19.431311v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.19.431311v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2021.02.19.431311.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Although the first approved vaccines were already administered by the end of 2020, vaccine availability is still limited. Moreover, immune escape variants of the virus are emerging against which the current vaccines may confer only limited protection. Further, existing antivirals and treatment options against COVID-19 only show limited efficacy. Influenza A virus (IAV) defective interfering particles (DIPs) were previously proposed not only for antiviral treatment of the influenza disease but also for pan-specific treatment of interferon (IFN)-sensitive respiratory virus infections. To investigate the applicability of IAV DIPs as an antiviral for the treatment of COVID-19, we conducted in vitro co-infection experiments with produced, cell culture-derived DIPs and the IFN-sensitive SARS-CoV-2. We show that treatment with IAV DIPs leads to complete abrogation of SARS-CoV-2 replication. Moreover, this inhibitory effect was dependent on janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling. These results suggest an unspecific stimulation of the innate immunity by IAV DIPs as a major contributor in suppressing SARS-CoV-2 replication. Thus, we propose IAV DIPs as an effective antiviral agent for treatment of COVID-19, and potentially also for suppressing the replication of new variants of SARS-CoV-2.",1,114,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.19.431972v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.19.431972v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2021.02.19.431972.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

However, many infected individuals are either asymptomatic or have isolated upper respiratory symptoms, which suggests that the upper airways represent the initial site of viral infection, and that some individuals are able to largely constrain viral pathology to the nasal and oropharyngeal tissues. Which cell types in the human nasopharynx are the primary targets of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and how infection influences the cellular organization of the respiratory epithelium remains incompletely understood. Here, we present nasopharyngeal samples from a cohort of 35 individuals with COVID-19, representing a wide spectrum of disease states from ambulatory to critically ill, as well as 23 healthy and intubated patients without COVID-19. Using standard nasopharyngeal swabs, we collected viable cells and performed single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), simultaneously profiling both host and viral RNA. We find that following infection with SARS-CoV-2, the upper respiratory epithelium undergoes massive reorganization: secretory cells diversify and expand, and mature epithelial cells are preferentially lost. Further, we observe evidence for deuterosomal cell and immature ciliated cell expansion, potentially representing active repopulation of lost ciliated cells through coupled secretory cell differentiation. Epithelial cells from participants with mild/moderate COVID-19 show extensive induction of genes associated with anti-viral and type I interferon responses. In contrast, cells from participants with severe lower respiratory symptoms appear globally muted in their anti-viral capacity, despite substantially higher local inflammatory myeloid populations and equivalent nasal viral loads. This suggests an essential role for intrinsic, local epithelial immunity in curbing and constraining viral-induced pathology. Using a custom computational pipeline, we characterized cell-associated SARS-CoV-2 RNA and identified rare cells with RNA intermediates strongly suggestive of active replication. Both within and across individuals, we find remarkable diversity and heterogeneity among SARS-CoV-2 RNA+ host cells, including developing/immature and interferon-responsive ciliated cells, KRT13+ ""hillock""-like cells, and unique subsets of secretory, goblet, and squamous cells. Finally, SARS-CoV-2 RNA+ cells, as compared to uninfected bystanders, are enriched for genes involved in susceptibility (e.g., CTSL, TMPRSS2) or response (e.g., MX1, IFITM3, EIF2AK2) to infection. Together, this work defines both protective and detrimental host responses to SARS-CoV-2, determines the direct viral targets of infection, and suggests that failed anti-viral epithelial immunity in the nasal mucosa may underlie the progression to severe COVID-19.",1,53,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.20.431155v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.20.431155v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2021.02.20.431155.txt,0,NA,1,NA,custom reference fasta and gtf for sars-cov-2 is available for download: https://github.com/shaleklab/sarscov2-genome-reference.  34   biorxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.20.431155; this version posted february 20 2021.

Emerging evidence has demonstrated that the endothelium represents the Achilles' heel in COVID-19 patients and that endothelial dysfunction precipitates COVID-19 and accompanying multi-organ injuries. Thus, pharmacotherapies targeting endothelial dysfunction have potential to ameliorate COVID-19 and its cardiovascular complications. Primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMECs) were treated with serum from control subjects or COVID-19 patients. Downstream monocyte adhesion and associated gene/protein expression was evaluated in endothelial cells exposed to COVID-19 patient serum in the presence of KLF2 activator (Atorvastatin) or KLF2 overexpression by an adenoviral vector. Here, we demonstrate that the expression of KLF2 was significantly reduced and monocyte adhesion was increased in endothelial cells treated with COVID-19 patient serum due to elevated levels of pro-adhesive molecules, ICAM1 and VCAM1. IL-1{beta} and TNF-, two cytokines observed in cytokine release syndrome in COVID-19 patients, decreased KLF2 gene expression. Next-generation RNA-sequencing data showed that atorvastatin treatment leads to a cardiovascular protective transcriptome associated with improved endothelial function (vasodilation, anti-inflammation, antioxidant status, anti-thrombosis/-coagulation, anti-fibrosis and reduced angiogenesis). Treatment of HPMECs with atorvastatin or KLF2 adenovirus ameliorate COVID-19 serum-induced increase in endothelial inflammation and monocyte adhesion by increasing KLF2 expression. Altogether, the present study demonstrates that genetic and pharmacological activation of KLF2 represses COVID-19 associated endothelial dysfunction, heralding a potentially new direction to treat endothelialitis accompanying COVID-19.",1,63,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.20.432085v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.20.432085v2.full.pdf,_10.1101_2021.02.20.432085.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Spatiotemporal dynamics of viral infection impact nearly all aspects of the progression of a viral infection, like the dependence of viral replication rates on the type of cell and pathogen, the strength of the immune response and localization of infection. Mathematical modeling is often used to describe respiratory viral infections and the immune response to them using ordinary differential equation (ODE) models. However, ODE models neglect spatially-resolved biophysical mechanisms like lesion shape and the details of viral transport, and so cannot model spatial effects of a viral infection and immune response. In this work, we develop a multiscale, multicellular spatiotemporal model of influenza infection and immune response by combining non-spatial ODE modeling and spatial, cell-based modeling. We employ cellularization, a recently developed method for generating spatial, cell-based, stochastic models from non-spatial ODE models, to generate much of our model from a calibrated ODE model that describes infection, death and recovery of susceptible cells and innate and adaptive responses during influenza infection, and develop models of cell migration and other mechanisms not explicitly described by the ODE model. We determine new model parameters to generate agreement between the spatial and original ODE models under certain conditions, where simulation replicas using our model serve as microconfigurations of the ODE model, and compare results between the models to investigate the nature of viral exposure and impact of heterogeneous infection on the time-evolution of the viral infection. We found that using spatially homogeneous initial exposure conditions consistently with those employed during calibration of the ODE model generates far less severe infection, and that local exposure to virus must be multiple orders of magnitude greater than a uniformly applied exposure to all available susceptible cells. This strongly suggests a prominent role of localization of exposure in influenza A infection. We propose that the particularities of the microenvironment to which a virus is introduced plays a dominant role in disease onset and progression, and that spatially resolved models like ours may be important to better understand and more reliably predict future health states based on susceptibility of potential lesion sites using spatially resolved patient data of the state of an infection. We can readily integrate the immune response components of our model into other modeling and simulation frameworks of viral infection dynamics that do detailed modeling of other mechanisms like viral internalization and intracellular viral replication dynamics, which are not explicitly represented in the ODE model. We can also combine our model with available experimental data and modeling of exposure scenarios and spatiotemporal aspects of mechanisms like mucociliary clearance that are only implicitly described by the ODE model, which would significantly improve the ability of our model to present spatially resolved predictions about the progression of influenza infection and immune response.",1,77,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.20.432089v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.20.432089v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2021.02.20.432089.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

To investigate the role of S1R in SARS-CoV-2 infection in the heart, we used human cardiomyocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC-CM) as an experimental model. Here we show that the S1R antagonist NE-100 decreases SARS-CoV-2 infection and viral replication in hiPSC-CMs. Also, NE-100 reduces cytokine release and cell death associated with infection. Because S1R is involved in cardiac physiology, we investigated the effects of NE-100 in cardiomyocyte morphology and function.

Replication of SARS-CoV-2 in lung is associated with marked infiltration of macrophages and activation of innate immune inflammatory responses triggered, in part, by heightened production of interleukin-6 (IL-6) that recruits lymphocytes to the site of infection that amplify tissue injury. Antagonists of the glucocorticoid and androgen receptors have shown promise in experimental models of COVID19 and in clinical studies, because cell surface proteins required for viral entry, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), are transcriptionally regulated by these receptors. We therefore postulated that the glucocorticoid (GR) and androgen receptor (AR) antagonist, PT150, would reduce infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 and prevent inflammatory lung injury in the Syrian golden hamster model of COVID19. Animals were infected intranasally with 2.5 x 104 TCID50/ml equivalents of SARS-CoV-2 (strain 2019-nCoV/USA-WA1/ 2020) and PT150 was administered by oral gavage at 30 and 100 mg/Kg/day for a total of 7 days. Animals were then examined at days 3, 5 and 7 post-infection (DPI) for lung histopathology, viral load and production of proteins regulating the initiation and progression of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results of these studies indicated that oral administration of PT150 decreased replication of SARS-CoV-2 in lung, as well as expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 protein. Hypercellularity and inflammatory cell infiltration driven by macrophage responses were dramatically decreased in PT150-treated animals, as was tissue damage and expression of IL-6. Molecular modeling suggested that PT150 binds to the co-activator interface of the ligand binding domain of both AR and GR and thereby acts as an allosteric modulator and transcriptional repressor of these receptors. Phylogenetic analysis of AR and GR across multiple species permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection revealed a high degree of sequence identity maintained across species, including human, suggesting that the mechanism of action and therapeutic efficacy observed in Syrian hamsters would likely be predictive of positive outcomes in patients. PT150 is therefore a strong candidate for further clinical development for the treatment of COVID19 across variants of SARS-CoV-2.",1,111,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.20.432110v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.20.432110v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2021.02.20.432110.txt,1,field-specific repository,0,for the glucocorticoid receptor the pdb: 3cld was selected due to the 2.84å  329  resolution limited other available structures and good coverage of the ligand binding domain of the  330  glucocorticoid receptor (259 residues).,NA

Through perturbation-based network modeling and community analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein complexes with ACE2 we demonstrate that E406, N439, K417 and N501 residues serve as effector centers of allosteric interactions and anchor major inter-molecular communities that mediate long-range communication in the complexes. The results provide support to a model according to which mutational variants and antibody-escaping mutations constrained by the requirements for host receptor binding and preservation of stability may preferentially select structurally plastic and energetically adaptable allosteric centers to differentially modulate collective motions and allosteric interactions in the complexes with the ACE2 enzyme and REGN-COV2 antibody combination.

Here, we investigated genetic variations in a 414-583 amino acid region of the Spike protein, partially encompassing the ACE2 receptor-binding domain (RBD), across a subset of 570 nasopharyngeal samples isolated between April 2020 and February 2021, from Washington, California, Arizona, Colorado, Minnesota and Illinois. We found that samples isolated since November have an increased number of amino acid mutations in the region, with L452R being the dominant mutation. This mutation is associated with a recently discovered CAL.20C viral variant from clade 20C, lineage B.1.429, that since November-December 2020 is associated with multiple outbreaks and is undergoing massive expansion across California. In some samples, however, we found a distinct L452R-carrying variant of the virus that, upon detailed analysis of the GISAID database genomes, is also circulating primarily in California, but emerged even more recently.

The newly identified variant derives from the clade 20A (lineage B.1.232) and is named CAL.20A. We also found that the SARS-CoV-2 strain that caused the only recorded case of infection in an ape - gorillas in the San Diego Zoo, reported in January 2021 - is CAL.20A. In contrast to CAL.20C that carries two additional to L452R mutations in the Spike protein, L452R is the only mutation found in CAL.20A. According to the phylogenetic analysis, however, emergence of CAL.20C was also specifically triggered by acquisition of the L452R mutation. Further analysis of GISAID-deposited genomes revealed that several independent L452R-carrying lineages have recently emerged across the globe, with over 90% of the isolates reported between December 2020 - February 2021. Taken together, these results indicate that the L452R mutation alone is of significant adaptive value to SARS-CoV-2 and, apparently, the positive selection for this mutation became particularly strong only recently, possibly reflecting viral adaptation to the containment measures or increasing population immunity. While the functional impact of L452R has not yet been extensively evaluated, leucine-452 is positioned in the receptor-binding motif of RBD, in the interface of direct contact with the ACE2 receptor.

Therefore, well characterized recombinant RBDs are essential. We have performed an in-depth structural and functional characterization of RBDs expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells. To structurally characterize the native RBDs (comprising N- and O-glycans and additional posttranslational modifications) a multilevel mass spectrometric approach was employed. Released glycan and glycopeptide analysis were integrated with intact mass analysis, glycan-enzymatic dissection and top-down sequencing for comprehensive annotation of RBD proteoforms. The data showed distinct glycosylation for CHO- and HEK293-RBD with the latter exhibiting antenna fucosylation, higher level of sialylation and a combination of core 1 and core 2 type O-glycans. Additionally, from both putative O-glycosylation sites, we could confirm that O-glycosylation was exclusively present at T323, which was previously unknown. For both RBDs, the binding to SARS-CoV-2 antibodies of positive patients and affinity to ACE2 receptor was addressed showing comparable results.

FK506 - binding protein like (FKBPL) is a member of the immunophilin protein superfamily with potent anti-tumor activity through inhibition of angiogenesis and cancer stemness. An FKBPL-based 23mer peptide, ALM201, displayed a good safety and pharmacokinetic profile in a Phase 1a oncology clinical trial and was subsequently designated orphan drug status by the FDA in ovarian cancer. Here we describe a novel role for FKBPL and its peptides in regulating vascular integrity and cytokine production though modulating NF-{kappa}B signaling. FKBPL knockdown promoted endothelial cell barrier permeability, which was further exacerbated upon stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and accompanied by increased expression of TNF mRNA and phosphorylation of p65(RelA). Whilst treatment with the FKBPL based pre-clinical peptide, AD-01, increased VE-cadherin endothelial tight junctions following LPS stimulation. Bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM) from FKBPL haploinsufficient mice (Fkbpl+/-) also demonstrated increased phosphorylation of p65(RelA) in response to LPS stimulation compared to wild-type mice. Furthermore, treatment with AD-01 inhibited p65(RelA) phosphorylation following LPS stimulation resulting in reduced NF-{kappa}B target gene expression and proinflammatory cytokine production. In an in vivo LPS survival model, Fkbpl+/- mice have reduced survival compared to wild-type mice. Moreover, treatment of wild-type mice with the clinical FKBPL-based peptide, ALM201, following LPS injection resulted in a 100% survival rate in mice at experimental endpoint, as well as an abrogation of production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF and IL-6, in peritoneal lavage washings. Analysis of human genetic biobanks found an association between common genetic variants associated with FKBPL and traits associated with inflammatory disorders such as psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis and high lymphocyte count.

Current research consequently aims (A) at methods that can remove noise, and (B) at techniques that allow for recovering a 3D impression of the virus or its parts. Here we discuss a novel method which can recover a spatial impression of a whole infection scene at high resolution. In contrast to previous approaches which aim at the reconstruction of single spike proteins or a single virus, the here used method can be applied to a single noisy EM image of an infection scene. As one example image, we show a high resolution image of SARS-CoV-2 viruses in Vero cell cultures (Fig. 1). The method we use is based on probabilistic machine learning algorithms which can operate in a  zero-shot setting, i.e., in a setting when just one noisy image (and no large and clean image corpus) is available. The probabilistic method we apply can estimate non-noisy images by inferring first order statistics (pixel means) across image patches using a previously learned probabilistic image representation.

Currently, there is no effective therapy against this virus. This article evaluated the in vitro antiviral effect of Atorvastatin against SARS-CoV-2 and also identified the interaction affinity between Atorvastatin and three SARS-CoV-2 proteins, using in silico structure-based molecular docking approach.

Materials and methodsThe antiviral activity of Atorvastatin against SARS-CoV-2 was evaluated by three different treatment strategies using a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2. The interaction of Atorvastatin with Spike, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and 3C-like protease (3CLpro) was evaluated by molecular docking.

ResultsAtorvastatin showed anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of 79%, 54.8%, 22.6% and 25% at 31.2, 15.6, 7.9, and 3.9 {micro}M, respectively, by pre-post-treatment strategy. In addition, atorvastatin demonstrated an antiviral effect of 26.9% at 31.2 {micro}M by pre-infection treatment. This compound also inhibited SARS-CoV-2 in 66.9%, 75%, 27.9% and 29.2% at concentrations of 31.2, 15.6, 7.9, and 3.9 {micro}M, respectively, by post-infection treatment. The interaction of atorvastatin with SARS-CoV-2 Spike, RdRp and 3CL protease yielded a binding affinity of -8.5 Kcal/mol, -6.2 Kcal/mol, and -7.5 Kcal/mol, respectively.

ConclusionOur study demonstrated the in vitro anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of Atorvastatin, mainly against the late steps of the viral replicative cycle. A favorable binding affinity with viral proteins by bioinformatics methods was also shown. Due to its low cost, availability, well-established safety and tolerability, and the extensive clinical experience of atorvastatin, it could prove valuable in reducing morbidity and mortality from COVID-19.

ImportanceThe COVID-19 pandemic constitutes the largest global public health crisis in a century, with enormous health and socioeconomic challenges. Therefore, it is necessary to search for specific antivirals against its causative agent (SARS-CoV-2). In this sense, the use of existing drugs may represent a useful treatment option in terms of safety, cost-effectiveness, and timeliness. Atorvastatin is widely used to prevent cardiovascular events. This compound modulates the synthesis of cholesterol, a molecule necessary in different stages of the viral replicative cycle. Our study demonstrated the antiviral potential of atorvastatin against SARS-CoV-2, using an in vitro model. Furthermore, the ability of Atorvastatin to directly interfere with three viral targets (Spike, RdRp and 3CL protease) was demonstrated by bioinformatic methods. This compound is a well-studied, low-cost, and generally well-tolerated drug, so it could be a promising antiviral for the treatment of COVID-19.",1,56,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.01.433498v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.01.433498v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2021.03.01.433498.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Applying our tool (periscope) to ARTIC Network Oxford Nanopore genomic sequencing data from 4400 SARS-CoV-2 positive clinical samples, we show that normalised sgRNA expression profiles are significantly increased in B.1.1.7 infections (n=879). This increase is seen over the previous dominant circulating lineage in the UK, B.1.177 (n=943), which is independent of genomic reads, E gene cycle threshold and days since symptom onset at sampling. A noncanonical sgRNA which could represent ORF9b is found in 98.4% of B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 infections compared with only 13.8% of other lineages, with a 16-fold increase in median expression. We hypothesise that this is a direct consequence of a triple nucleotide mutation in nucleocapsid (28280:GAT>CAT, D3L) creating a transcription regulatory-like sequence complementary to a region 3 of the genomic leader. These findings provide a unique insight into the biology of B.1.1.7 and support monitoring of sgRNA profiles in sequence data to evaluate emerging potential variants of concern.

Binding and functional neutralization assays and systems serology revealed that NHP developed AS03-dependent multi-functional humoral responses that targeted multiple spike domains and bound to a variety of antibody FC receptors mediating effector functions in vitro. Pseudovirus and live virus neutralizing IC50 titers were on average greater than 1000 and significantly higher than a panel of human convalescent sera. NHP were challenged intranasally and intratracheally with a high dose (3x106 PFU) of SARS-CoV-2 (USA-WA1/2020 isolate). Two days post-challenge, vaccinated NHP showed rapid control of viral replication in both the upper and lower airways. Notably, vaccinated NHP also had increased spike-specific IgG antibody responses in the lung as early as 2 days post challenge.

One of the main drug target proteins proposed so far is the SARS-CoV-2 viral protease 3CLpro (also called Mpro), an essential component for viral replication. Ongoing ligand- and receptor-based computational screening efforts would be facilitated by an improved understanding of the electrostatic, hydrophobic and steric features that characterize small molecule inhibitors binding stably to 3CLpro, as well as by an extended collection of known binders.

Here, we present combined virtual screening, molecular dynamics simulation, machine learning and in vitro experimental validation analyses which have led to the identification of small molecule inhibitors of 3CLpro with micromolar activity, and to a pharmacophore model that describes functional chemical groups associated with the molecular recognition of ligands by the 3CLpro binding pocket. Experimentally validated inhibitors using a ligand activity assay include natural compounds with available prior knowledge on safety and bioavailability properties, such as the natural compound rottlerin (IC50 = 37 M), and synthetic compounds previously not characterized (e.g. compound CID 46897844, IC50 = 31 M). In combination with the developed pharmacophore model, these and other confirmed 3CLpro inhibitors may provide a basis for further similarity-based screening in independent compound databases and structural design optimization efforts, to identify 3CLpro ligands with improved potency and selectivity.

Overall, this study suggests that the integration of virtual screening, molecular dynamics simulations and machine learning can facilitate 3CLpro-targeted small molecule screening investigations. Different receptor-, ligand- and machine learning-based screening strategies provided complementary information, helping to increase the number and diversity of identified active compounds. Finally, the resulting pharmacophore model and experimentally validated small molecule inhibitors for 3CLpro provide resources to support follow-up computational screening efforts for this drug target.",1,66,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.02.433618v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.02.433618v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2021.03.02.433618.txt,1,field-specific repository,1,computational methods protein structure pre-processing three publicly available protein crystal structures for 3clpro from the protein data bank [22] were chosen for the molecular docking analyses and binding affinity estimation (pdb: 5r8t 6yb7 and 6lu7).;     similarly for compound baicalein a crystal structure of the complex with 3clpro was already available (pdb id: 6m2n) and used to extract the binding pose.;     the merged pharmacophore model has therefore been made available in the “compressed pharmaceutical markup language” (pmz) format on github (https://github.com/eglaab/3clpro).  a)  b)  figure 4. a) pharmacophore model for 3clpro derived from the reference inhibitor gc-376 / gc-373 using the software ligandscout (conformation obtained from the pdb crystal structure 7d1m after preprocessing with the software schrödinger maestro see methods).,example video animations of the md simulations which were applied to the top-ranked dockingderived compounds to confirm the stability of the binding are provided online together with the configuration settings used for the md simulation software namd (https://github.com/eglaab/3clpro).;     the merged pharmacophore model has therefore been made available in the “compressed pharmaceutical markup language” (pmz) format on github (https://github.com/eglaab/3clpro).  a)  b)  figure 4. a) pharmacophore model for 3clpro derived from the reference inhibitor gc-376 / gc-373 using the software ligandscout (conformation obtained from the pdb crystal structure 7d1m after preprocessing with the software schrödinger maestro see methods).;     for the molecular dynamics simulations the configuration settings used for the software namd and exemplary video animations of md simulations for confirmed inhibitors are available on github (https://github.com/eglaab/3clpro).

MethodsHere we comprehensively analyzed the peripheral T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire of 54 COVID-19 patients in different phases, including asymptomatic, symptomatic, convalescent and re-detectable positive cases.

ResultsWe found progressed immune responses from asymptomatic to symptomatic phase. Furthermore, the TCR profiles of re-detectable positive cases were highly similar to those of asymptomatic patients, which could predict the risk of recurrent infection.

ConclusionTherefore, TCR repertoire surveillance has the potential to strengthen the clinical management and the immunotherapy development for COVID-19.

The coronavirus induced immune response observed in these upper and lower respiratory airway models are similar to what has been reported in COVID-19 patients. The antiviral efficacy results of a few promising anti-coronavirus drugs in these models were consistent with previous reports and could be valuable for the human dose prediction.

Although cigarette smoke is generally believed to be harmful to the pathogenesis of COVID-19, cigarette smoke extract (CSE) treatments were surprisingly found to suppress the expression of ACE2 in HepG2 cells. We thus tried to clarify the mechanism of CSE effects on expression of ACE2 in mammalian cells. Because RNA-seq analysis suggested that suppressive effects on ACE2 might be inversely correlated with induction of the genes regulated by aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), the AHR agonists 6-formylindolo(3,2-b)carbazole (FICZ) and omeprazole (OMP) were tested to assess whether those treatments affected ACE2 expression. Both FICZ and OMP clearly suppressed ACE2 expression in a dose-dependent manner along with inducing CYP1A1. Knock-down experiments indicated a reduction of ACE2 by FICZ treatment in an AHR-dependent manner. Finally, treatments of AHR agonists inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection into Vero E6 cells as determined with immunoblotting analyses detecting SARS-CoV-2 specific nucleocapsid protein.

The CoV envelope (E) protein, an important contributor to the pathogenesis of severe hCoVs infections, may provide insight into this disparate severity of the disease. Topology prediction programs and 3D modelling software was used to predict and visualize structural aspects of the hCoV E protein related to its functions. All seven hCoV E proteins largely adopted different topologies, with some distinction between the more virulent and less virulent ones. The 3D models refined this distinction, showing the PDZ-binding motif (PBM) of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 to be more flexible than the PBM of hCoVs 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1. We speculate that the increased flexibility of the PBM may provide the more virulent hCoVs with a greater degree of freedom, which can allow them to bind to different host proteins and can contribute to a more severe form of the disease.

We identified coronavirus contigs in 40 of 100 sequencing libraries, including seven representing SARS-CoV-2-like contigs. From these data we obtained 24 full-length coronavirus genomes, including four novel SARS-CoV-2 related and three SARS-CoV related genomes.

While the imbalanced innate immune response of end-stage COVID-19 has been extensively studied, the earliest stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection at the mucosal entry site have remained unexplored. Here we employed SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus infection in native multi-cell-type human nasal turbinate and lung tissues ex vivo, coupled with genome-wide transcriptional analysis, to investigate viral susceptibility and early patterns of local-mucosal innate immune response in the authentic milieu of the human respiratory tract. SARS-CoV-2 productively infected the nasal turbinate tissues, predominantly targeting respiratory epithelial cells, with rapid increase in tissue-associated viral sub-genomic mRNA, and secretion of infectious viral progeny. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 infection triggered robust antiviral and inflammatory innate immune responses in the nasal mucosa. The upregulation of interferon stimulated genes, cytokines and chemokines, related to interferon signaling and immune-cell activation pathways, was broader than that triggered by influenza virus infection. Conversely, lung tissues exhibited a restricted innate immune response to SARS-CoV-2, with a conspicuous lack of type I and III interferon upregulation, contrasting with their vigorous innate immune response to influenza virus. Our findings reveal differential tissue-specific innate immune responses in the upper and lower respiratory tract, that are distinct to SARS-CoV-2. The studies shed light on the role of the nasal-mucosa in active viral transmission and immune defense, implying a window of opportunity for early interventions, whereas the restricted innate immune response in early-SARS-CoV-2-infected lung tissues could underlie the unique uncontrolled late-phase lung damage of advanced COVID-19.

IMPORTANCEIn order to reduce the late-phase morbidity and mortality of COVID-19, there is a need to better understand and target the earliest stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the human respiratory tract. Here we have studied the initial steps of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the consequent innate immune responses within the natural multicellular complexity of human nasal-mucosal and lung tissues. Comparing the global innate response patterns of nasal and lung tissues, infected in parallel with SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus, we have revealed distinct virus-host interactions in the upper and lower respiratory tract, which could determine the outcome and unique pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Studies in the nasal-mucosal infection model can be employed to assess the impact of viral evolutionary changes, and evaluate new therapeutic and preventive measures against SARS-CoV-2 and other human respiratory pathogens.",1,170,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.08.434404v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.08.434404v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2021.03.08.434404.txt,1,"field-specific repository, data availability statement",0,527  the transcriptomic data described in this publication have been deposited in the  528  ncbi gene expression omnibus and are accessible through geo series accession  529  number gse163959.      data availability. 527  the transcriptomic data described in this publication have been deposited in the  528  ncbi gene expression omnibus and are accessible through geo series accession  529  number gse163959,NA

While vaccines are being introduced into the market, there is also a pressing need to find potential drugs and therapeutic modules. Remdesivir is one of the antivirals currently being used with a limited window of action. As more drugs are being vetted, passive immunotherapy in the form of neutralizing antibodies can provide immediate action to combat the increasing numbers of COVID-positive cases. Herein, we demonstrate that equines hyper-immunized with chemically inactivated SARS-CoV-2 generate high titers of antibody with a strong virus neutralizing potential. ELISA performed with pooled antisera displayed highest immunoglobulin titer on 42 days post-immunization, at 1:51,200 dilutions. F(ab)2 immunoglobulin fragments generated from the pools also showed very high, antigen-specific affinity at 1:102,400 dilutions. Finally, in vitro virus neutralization assays confirmed that different pools of F(ab)2 fragments could successfully neutralize SARS-CoV-2 with titers well above 25,000, indicating the potential of this strategy in treating severe COVID-19 cases with high titers. The F(ab)2 was able to cross neutralize another SARS-CoV-2 strain, demonstrating its efficacy against the emerging viral variants and the importance of this approach in our efforts of eradication of COVID-19.

Thus, other therapeutic options are necessary. One such therapeutic option that leverages SARS-CoV-2 initiation of infection by binding of its spike receptor binding domain (S RBD) to surface-expressed host cell angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an ACE2  decoy that would trap the virus by competitive binding and thus inhibit propagation of infection. Here, we used Molecular Dynamic (MD) simulations to predict ACE2 mutations that might increase its affinity for S RBD and screened these candidates for binding affinity in vitro. A double mutant ACE2(T27Y/H34A)-IgG1FC fusion protein was found to have very high affinity for S RBD and to show greater neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 in a live virus assay as compared to wild type ACE2. We further modified the double mutant ACE2 decoy by addition of an H374N mutation to inhibit ACE2 enzymatic activity while maintaining high S RBD affinity. We then confirmed the potential efficacy of our ACE2(T27Y/H34A/H374N)-IgG1FC Triple Decoy against S RBD expressing variant-associated E484K, K417N, N501Y, and L452R mutations and found that our ACE2 Triple Decoy not only maintains its high affinity for S RBD expressing these mutations, but shows enhanced affinity for S RBD expressing the N501Y or L452R mutations and the highest affinity for S RBD expressing both the E484K and N501Y mutations. The ACE2 Triple Decoy also demonstrates the ability to compete with wild type ACE2 in the cPass surrogate virus neutralization in the presence of S RBD with these mutations. Additional MD simulation of ACE2 WT and decoy interactions with S RBD WT or B.1.351 variant sequence S RBD provides insight into the enhanced affinity of the ACE2 decoy for S RBD and reveals its potential as a tool to predict affinity and inform therapeutic design. The ACE2 Triple Decoy is now undergoing continued assessment, including expression by a human adenovirus serotype 5 (hAd5) construct to facilitate delivery in vivo.

Summary sentenceAn ACE2(N27Y/H34A/H374N)-IgG1FC fusion protein decoy sustains high affinity to all SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain (RBD) protein variants tested, shows enhanced affinity for the N501Y and L452R variants, and the highest affinity for combined N501Y and E484K variants.",1,145,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.09.434641v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.09.434641v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2021.03.09.434641.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Manipulation of epigenetic machinery to influence viral infectivity of host cells is a relatively unexplored area. The bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) family of epigenetic readers have been reported to modulate SARS-CoV-2 infection. Herein, we demonstrate apabetalone, the most clinical advanced BET inhibitor, downregulates expression of cell surface receptors involved in SARS-CoV-2 entry, including angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP4 or CD26) in SARS-CoV-2 permissive cells. Moreover, we show that apabetalone inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro to levels comparable to antiviral agents. Taken together, our study supports further evaluation of apabetalone to treat COVID-19, either alone or in combination with emerging therapeutics.

In the USA, two highly protective mRNA vaccines are available: BNT162b2 from Pfizer/BioNTech and mRNA-1273 from Moderna (3, 4). These vaccines induce antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein, including neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) predominantly directed against the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) (1-4). Serum NAbs are induced at modest levels within [~]1 week of the first dose, but their titers are strongly boosted by a second dose at 3 (BNT162b2) or 4 weeks (mRNA-1273) (3, 4). SARS-CoV-2 is most commonly transmitted nasally or orally and infects cells in the mucosae of the respiratory and to some extent also the gastrointestinal tract (5). Although serum NAbs may be a correlate of protection against COVID-19, mucosal antibodies might directly prevent or limit virus acquisition by the nasal, oral and conjunctival routes (5). Whether the mRNA vaccines induce mucosal immunity has not been studied.

All variants either retained or improved binding to the ACE2 receptor. The B.1.1.7 (UK) and B.1.1.28 (Brazil) spike variants showed reduced binding to neutralizing NTD and RBD antibodies, respectively, while the B.1.351 (SA) variant showed reduced binding to both NTD- and RBD-directed antibodies.

The interaction between the ACE2 receptors at the surface of human cells and the viral Spike (S) protein triggers the infection making the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein a focal target for the neutralizing antibodies (Abs). Despite the recent progress in the development and deployment of vaccines, the emergence of novel variants of SARS-CoV-2 insensitive to Abs produced in response to the vaccine administration and/or monoclonal ones represents upcoming jeopardy. Here, we assessed the possible effects of single and multiple mutations in the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 S-protein on its binding energy to various antibodies and the human ACE2 receptor. The performed computational analysis indicates that while single amino acid replacements in RBD may only cause partial impairment of the Abs binding, moreover, limited to specific epitopes, some variants of SARS-CoV-2 (with as few as 8 mutations), which are already present in the population, may potentially result in a much broader antigenic escape. We also identified a number of point mutations, which, in contrast to the majority of replacements, reduce RBD affinity to various antibodies without affecting its binding to ACE2.

While ultra-violet (UV) based technologies have shown satisfactory virucidal potential, the photo-toxicity in humans coupled with UV associated polymer degradation limit its use in occupied spaces. Alternatively, longer wavelengths with less irradiation energy such as visible light (405 nm) have largely been explored in the context of bactericidal and fungicidal applications. Such studies indicated that 405 nm mediated inactivation is caused by the absorbance of porphyrins within the organism creating reactive oxygen species which result in free radical damage to its DNA and disruption of cellular functions. The virucidal potential of visible-light based technologies has been largely unexplored and speculated to be not effective given the lack of porphyrins in viruses. The current study demonstrated increased susceptibility of lipid-enveloped respiratory pathogens of importance such as SARS-CoV-2 (causative agent of COVID-19) as well as the influenza A virus to 405nm, visible light in the absence of exogenous photosensitizers, indicating a potential porphyrin-independent alternative mechanism of visible light mediated viral inactivation.

Targeting functionally conserved epitopes may help reduce the likelihood of viral escape and aid in preventing the spread of related viruses with pandemic potential. One such functionally conserved viral epitope is the site to which a receptor must bind to facilitate viral entry. Here, we leveraged rational immunogen design strategies to focus humoral responses to the receptor binding motif (RBM) on the SARS-CoV-2 spike. Using glycan engineering and epitope scaffolding, we find an improved targeting of the serum response to the RBM in context of SARS-CoV-2 spike imprinting. Furthermore, we observed a robust SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing serum response with increased potency against related sarbecoviruses, SARS-CoV and WIV1-CoV. Thus, RBM focusing is a promising strategy to elicit breadth across emerging sarbecoviruses and represents an adaptable design approach for targeting conserved epitopes on other viral glycoproteins.

Two compounds selected from the FlipGFP-PLpro assay, Jun9-53-2 and Jun9-72-2, inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in Caco-2 hACE2 cells with EC50 values of 8.89 and 8.32 {micro}M, respectively, which were 3-fold more potent than GRL0617 (EC50 = 25.1 {micro}M). The X-ray crystal structures of PLpro in complex with GRL0617 showed that binding of GRL0617 to SARS-CoV-2 induced a conformational change in the BL2 loop to the more closed conformation. Overall, the PLpro inhibitors identified in this study represent promising starting points for further development as SARS-CoV-2 antivirals, and FlipGFP-PLpro assay might be a suitable surrogate for screening PLpro inhibitors in the BSL-2 setting.",1,174,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.15.435551v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.15.435551v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2021.03.15.435551.txt,1,"field-specific repository, data availability statement",0,it is made available under acc-by 4.0 international license.  with grl0617 (pdb id 7cjm) no acetate is modelled but leu162 adopts the same conformation as the higher-resolution c111s structure (pdb id 7jir).;     the drug-bound complex structures for sars-cov-2 plpro with grl0617 was deposited in the protein data bank with accession numbers of 7jrn.      data availability. the drug-bound complex structures for sars-cov-2 plpro with grl0617 was deposited in the protein data bank with accession numbers of 7jrn,NA

Severe RNA virus respiratory infections often correlate with high viral load and excessive inflammation. Understanding the dynamics of the innate immune response and its manifestation at the cell and tissue levels are vital to understanding the mechanisms of immunopathology and developing improved, strain independent treatments. Here, we present a novel spatialized multicellular spatial computational model of two principal components of tissue infection and response: RNA virus replication and type-I interferon mediated antiviral response to infection within lung epithelial cells. The model is parameterized using data from influenza virus infected cell cultures and, consistent with experimental observations, exhibits either linear radial growth of viral plaques or arrested plaque growth depending on the local concentration of type I interferons. Modulating the phosphorylation of STAT or altering the ratio of the diffusion constants of interferon and virus in the cell culture could lead to plaque growth arrest. The dependence of arrest on diffusion constants highlights the importance of developing validated spatial models of cytokine signaling and the need for in vitro experiments to measure these diffusion constants. Sensitivity analyses were performed under conditions creating both continuous plaque growth and arrested plaque growth. Findings suggest that plaque growth and cytokine assay measurements should be collected during arrested plaque growth, as the model parameters are significantly more sensitive and more likely to be identifiable. The models metrics replicate experimental immunostaining imaging and titer based sampling assays. The model is easy to extend to include SARS-CoV-2-specific mechanisms as they are discovered or to include as a component linking epithelial cell signaling to systemic immune models.

Author SummaryCOVID-19 is possibly the defining healthcare crisis of the current generation, with tens of millions of global cases and more than a million reported deaths. Respiratory lung infections form lesions in the lungs, whose number and size correlate with severity of illness. In some severe cases, the disease triggers a severe inflammatory condition known as cytokine storm. Given the complexity of the immune system, computational modeling is needed to link molecular signaling at the site of inflection to the signaling impact on the overall immune system, ultimately revealing how severe inflammatory conditions may emerge. Here, we created a computational model of the early stages of infection that simulates lung cells infected with RNA viruses, such those responsible for COVID-19 and influenza, to help explore how the disease forms viral plaques, an in vitro analog to lesion growth in the lung. Our model recapitulates in vitro observations that pretreatment of biological signaling molecules called with type-I interferons, which are currently being evaluated for treatment of COVID-19. Analyzing the model, we, can stop viral plaque growth. We found that enhancing certain aspects of the innate immune system, such as the JAK/STAT pathway, may be able to stop viral plaque growth, suggesting molecules involved in this pathway as possible drug candidates. Quantifying the parameters needed to model interferon signaling and viral replication, experiments should be performed under conditions that inhibit viral growth, such as pretreating cells with interferon. We present a computational framework that is essential to constructing larger models of respiratory infection induced immune responses, can be used to evaluate drugs and other medical interventions quickly, cheaply, and without the need for animal testing during the initial phase, and that defines experiments needed to improve our fundamental understanding of the mechanisms regulating the immune response.",1,199,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.16.435618v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.16.435618v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2021.03.16.435618.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Here we investigated direct inflammatory functions of major structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2. We observed that spike (S) protein potently induces inflammatory cytokines and chemokines including IL-6, IL-1{beta}, TNFa, CXCL1, CXCL2, and CCL2, but not IFNs in human and mouse macrophages. No such inflammatory response was observed in response to membrane (M), envelope (E), and neucleocapsid (N) proteins. When stimulated with extracellular S protein, human lung epithelial cells A549 also produce inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Interestingly, epithelial cells expressing S protein intracellularly are non-inflammatory, but elicit an inflammatory response in macrophages when co-cultured. Biochemical studies revealed that S protein triggers inflammation via activation of the NF-{kappa}B pathway in a MyD88-dependent manner. Further, such an activation of the NF-{kappa}B pathway is abrogated in Tlr2-deficient macrophages. Consistently, administration of S protein induces IL-6, TNF-a, and IL-1 {beta} in wild-type, but not Tlr2-deficient mice. Together these data reveal a mechanism for the cytokine storm during SARS-CoV-2 infection and suggest that TLR2 could be a potential therapeutic target for COVID-19.",1,171,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.16.435700v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.16.435700v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2021.03.16.435700.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Recently, we and others have shown that genes associated with variants that confer risk for AD are significantly enriched in transcriptional networks expressed by amyloid-responsive microglia. This allowed us to predict new risk genes for AD, including the interferon-responsive oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1). However, the function of OAS1 within microglia and its genetic pathway are not known. Using genotyping from 1,313 individuals with sporadic AD and 1,234 control individuals, we confirm that the OAS1 variant, rs1131454, is associated with increased risk for AD and decreased OAS1 expression. Moreover, we note that the same locus was recently associated with critical illness in response to COVID-19, linking variants that are associated with AD and a severe response to COVID-19. By analysing single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of isolated microglia from APPNL-G-F knock-in and wild-type C57BL/6J mice, we identify a transcriptional network that is significantly upregulated with age and amyloid deposition, and contains the mouse orthologue Oas1a, providing evidence that Oas1a plays an age-dependent function in the innate immune system. We identify a similar interferon-related transcriptional network containing OAS1 by analysing scRNA-seq data from human microglia isolated from individuals with AD. Finally, using human iPSC-derived microglial cells (h-iPSC-Mg), we see that OAS1 is required to limit the pro-inflammatory response of microglia. When stimulated with interferon-gamma (IFN-{gamma}), we note that cells with lower OAS1 expression show an exaggerated pro-inflammatory response, with increased expression and secretion of TNF-. Collectively, our data support a link between genetic risk for AD and susceptibility to critical illness with COVID-19 centred on OAS1 and interferon signalling, a finding with potential implications for future treatments of both AD and COVID-19, and the development of biomarkers to track disease progression.",1,68,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.16.435702v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.16.435702v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2021.03.16.435702.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

The Gene-Fragment Phage display library spanning the SARS-CoV-2 spike demonstrated broad recognition of multiple antigenic sites spanning the entire spike including NTD, RBD, S1/S2 cleavage site, S2-fusion peptide and S2-heptad repeat regions.

Neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs from around the globe were reduced to different levels by hCoV-2IG lots.

The interaction of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with cell surface heparan sulfate (HS) promotes viral entry3. We find that halofuginone reduces HS biosynthesis, thereby reducing spike protein binding, SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus, and authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection. Halofuginone also potently suppresses SARS-CoV-2 replication post-entry and is 1,000-fold more potent than Remdesivir4. Inhibition of HS biosynthesis and SARS-CoV-2 infection depends on specific inhibition of PRS, possibly due to translational suppression of proline-rich proteins. We find that pp1a and pp1ab polyproteins of SARS-CoV-2, as well as several HS proteoglycans, are proline-rich, which may make them particularly vulnerable to halofuginones translational suppression.

ACE2 and TMPRRS2 expression profiles have been analyzed at the genomic, transcriptomic, and single-cell RNAseq level, however, biologically relevant protein receptor organization in whole tissues is still poorly understood. To describe the organ-level architecture of receptor expression, related to the ability of ACE2 and TMPRRS2 to mediate infectivity, we performed a volumetric analysis of whole Syrian hamster lung lobes. Lung tissue of infected and control animals were stained using antibodies against ACE2 and TMPRRS2, combined with fluorescent spike protein and SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein staining. This was followed by light-sheet microscopy imaging to visualize expression patterns. The data demonstrates that infection is restricted to sites with both ACE2 and TMPRRS2, the latter is expressed in the primary and secondary bronchi whereas ACE2 is predominantly observed in the terminal bronchioles and alveoli. Conversely, infection completely overlaps at these sites where ACE2 and TMPRSS2 co-localize.

For example, some individual genes or operons can be affected by specific horizontal gene transfer and recombination events. Thus, the evolutionary history of each gene should be represented by its own phylogenetic tree which may display different evolutionary patterns from the species tree that accounts for the main patterns of vertical descent. The output of traditional consensus tree or supertree inference methods is a unique consensus tree or supertree. Here, we describe a new efficient method for inferring multiple alternative consensus trees and supertrees to best represent the most important evolutionary patterns of a given set of phylogenetic trees (i.e. additive trees or X-trees). We show how a specific version of the popular k-means clustering algorithm, based on some interesting properties of the Robinson and Foulds topological distance, can be used to partition a given set of trees into one (when the data are homogeneous) or multiple (when the data are heterogeneous) cluster(s) of trees. We adapt the popular Cali[n]ski-Harabasz, Silhouette, Ball and Hall, and Gap cluster validity indices to tree clustering with k-means. A special attention is paid to the relevant but very challenging problem of inferring alternative supertrees, built from phylogenies constructed for different, but mutually overlapping, sets of taxa. The use of the Euclidean approximation in the objective function of the method makes it faster than the existing tree clustering techniques, and thus perfectly suitable for the analysis of large genomic datasets.

Recently, four functionally distinct variants, B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1 and CAL.20C, have been identified, and they appear to more infectious and transmissible than the original (Wuhan-Hu-1) virus. Here we provide evidence based upon a combination of bioinformatics and structural approaches that can explain the higher infectivity of the new variants. Our results show that the greater infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 than SARS-CoV can be attributed to a combination of several factors, including alternate receptors. Additionally, we show that new SARS-CoV-2 variants emerged in the background of D614G in Spike protein and P323L in RNA polymerase.

In this study, we computationally designed several Ang II mutants to find a strong binding sequence to ACE2 receptor and examined the role of ligand substitution in the docking of native as well as mutant Ang II to the ACE2 receptor. The peptide in the ACE2-peptide complex was coordinated to zinc in the ACE2 cleft. Exploratory molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were used to measure the time-based stability of the native and mutant peptides and their receptor complexes. The MD-generated root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) values are mostly similar between the native and seven mutant peptides considered in this work, although the values for free peptides demonstrated higher variation, and often were higher in amplitude than peptides associated with the ACE2 complex. An observed lack of a strong secondary structure in the short peptides is attributed to the latters greater flexibility and movement. The strongest binding energies within the ACE2-peptide complexes were observed in the native Ang II and only one of its mutant variants, suggesting ACE2 cleft is designed to provide optimal binding to the native sequence. An examination of the S1 binding site on ACE2 suggests that complex formation alone with these peptides may not be sufficient to allosterically inhibit the binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins.

Since most animal models are not susceptible to SARS CoV-2 infection, pre-clinical studies are often limited to infection-prone animals such as hamsters and non-human primates. In these animal models, SARS-CoV-2 infection results in viral replication and a mild disease disease. Therefore, the protective efficacy of the vaccine in these animals is commonly evaluated by its ability to elicit immunologic responses, diminish viral replication and prevent weight loss. Our lab recently reported the design of a SARS-CoV-2 human Fc-conjugated receptor-binding domain (RBD-hFc) mRNA vaccine delivered via lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). These experiments demonstrated the development of a robust and specific immunologic response in RBD-hFc mRNA-vaccinated BALB/c mice. In the current study, we evaluated the protective effect of this RBD-hFc mRNA vaccine by employing the K18-hACE2 mouse model.

The impacts of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic permeate into our environment and wildlife as well; in particular, concern has been raised about the viral occurrence and persistence in aquatic and marine ecosystems. The discharge of untreated wastewaters carrying infectious SARS-CoV-2 into natural water systems that are home of sea mammals may have dramatic consequences on vulnerable species.

The efficient transmission of coronaviruses raise questions regarding the contributions of virus-receptors interactions. The main receptor of SARS-CoV-2 is Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE-2), serving as a functional receptor for the viral spike (S) protein. This study was aimed, through the comparative analysis of the ACE-2 receptor with the human one, at assessing the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 of the different species of marine mammals living in Italian waters. We also determined, by means of immunohistochemistry, ACE-2 receptor localization in the lung tissue from different cetacean species, in order to provide a preliminary characterization of ACE-.2 expression in the marine mammals respiratory tract.

Furthermore, in order to evaluate if and how wastewater management in Italy may lead to susceptible marine mammal populations being exposed to the virus, geo-mapping data of wastewater plants, associated to the identification of specific stretches of coast more exposed to extreme weather events, overlapped to marine mammal population data, were carried out. Results showed the SARS-CoV-2 exposure for marine mammals inhabiting Italian coastal waters. Thus, we highlight the potential hazard of reverse zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection, along with its impact on marine mammals regularly inhabiting the Mediterranean Sea, whilst also stressing the need of appropriate action to prevent further damage to specific vulnerable populations.

Significance StatementGrowing concern exists that SARS-CoV-2, as already ascertained for its SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV ""predecessors"", originated from an animal ""reservoir"", performing thereafter its spillover into mankind, that was possibly anticipated by viral ""passage"" into a secondary animal host. Within the dramatic SARS-CoV-2 pandemic context, hitherto characterized by over 110 million cases and almost 2,500,000 deaths on a global scale, several domestic and wild animal species have been reported as susceptible to natural and/or experimental SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this respect, while some marine mammal species are deemed as potentially susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection on the basis of the sequence homology of their ACE-2 viral receptor with the human one, this study addresses such a critical issue also in stranded sea mammal specimens.",1,183,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.29.437540v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.29.437540v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2021.03.29.437540.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

It has become a global pandemic and its frequent mutations may pose new challenges for vaccine design. During viral infection, the Spike RBD of SARS-CoV-2 binds the human host cell receptor ACE2, enabling the virus to enter the host cell. Both the Spike and ACE2 are densely glycosylated, and it is unclear how distinctive glycan types may modulate the interaction of RBD and ACE2. Detailed understanding of these determinants is key for the development of novel therapeutic strategies. To this end, we perform extensive all-atom simulations of the (i) RBD-ACE2 complex without glycans, (ii) RBD-ACE2 with oligomannose MAN9 glycans in ACE2, and (iii) RBD-ACE2 with complex FA2 glycans in ACE2. These simulations identify the key residues at the RBD-ACE2 interface that form contacts with higher probabilities, thus providing a quantitative evaluation that complements recent structural studies. Notably, we find that this RBD-ACE2 contact signature is not altered by the presence of different glycoforms, suggesting that RBD-ACE2 interaction is robust. Applying our simulated results, we illustrate how the recently prevalent N501Y mutation may alter specific interactions with host ACE2 that facilitate the virus-host binding. Furthermore, our simulations reveal how the glycan on Asn90 of ACE2 can play a distinct role in the binding and unbinding of RBD. Finally, an energetics analysis shows that MAN9 glycans on ACE2 decrease RBD-ACE2 affinity, while FA2 glycans lead to enhanced binding of the complex.

Despite several reports demonstrating that Mac1 is a prominent virulence factor, there is still a limited understanding of its cellular roles during infection. Currently, most of the information regarding the role of CoV Mac1 during infection is based on a single point mutant of a highly conserved asparagine-to-alanine mutation, which is known to largely eliminate Mac1 ADP-ribosylhydrolase activity. To determine if Mac1 ADP-ribose binding separately contributes to CoV replication, we compared the replication of a murine hepatitis virus (MHV) Mac1 mutant predicted to dramatically reduce ADP-ribose binding, D1329A, to the previously mentioned asparagine mutant, N1347A. D1329A and N1347A both replicated poorly in bone-marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs), were inhibited by PARP enzymes, and were highly attenuated in vivo. However, D1329A was significantly more attenuated than N1347A in all cell lines tested that were susceptible to MHV infection. In addition, D1329A retained some ability to block IFN-{beta} transcript accumulation compared to N1347A, indicating that these two mutants impacted distinct Mac1 functions. Mac1 mutants predicted to eliminate both binding and hydrolysis activities were unrecoverable, suggesting that the combined activities of Mac1 may be essential for MHV replication. We conclude that Mac1 has multiple roles in promoting the replication of MHV, and that these results provide further evidence that Mac1 could be a prominent target for anti-CoV therapeutics.

IMPORTANCEIn the wake of the COVID-19 epidemic, there has been a surge to better understand how CoVs replicate, and to identify potential therapeutic targets that could mitigate disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 and other prominent CoVs. The highly conserved macrodomain, also termed Mac1, is a small domain within non-structural protein 3. It has received significant attention as a potential drug target as previous studies demonstrated that it is essential for CoV pathogenesis in multiple animal models of infection. However, the various roles and functions of Mac1 during infection remain largely unknown. Here, utilizing recombinant Mac1 mutant viruses, we have determined that different biochemical functions of Mac1 have distinct roles in the replication of MHV, a model CoV. These results indicate that Mac1 is more important for CoV replication than previously appreciated, and could help guide the development of inhibitory compounds that target unique regions of this protein domain.",1,148,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.30.437796v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.30.437796v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2021.03.30.437796.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Infection of animals could be detrimental by causing clinical disease but also of concern if they become a viral reservoir allowing further mutations, plus having the potential to infect other animals or humans. The first reported animals to be infected both under experimental conditions and from anecdotal field evidence were cats described in China early in 2020. Given the concerns this finding raised and the close contacts between humans and cats, we aimed to determine whether a vaccine candidate could be developed that was suitable for use in multiple susceptible animal species and whether this vaccine could reduce infection of cats in addition to preventing spread to other cats.

Here we report that a Replicon Particle (RP) vaccine based on Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV), known to be safe and efficacious for use in a variety of animals, expressing a stabilised Spike antigen, could induce neutralising antibody titers in guinea pigs and cats. After two intramuscular vaccinations, virus neutralising antibodies were detected in the respiratory tract of the guinea pigs and a cell mediated immune response was induced. The design of the SARS-CoV-2 antigen was shown to be critical in developing a strong neutralising antibody response. Vaccination of cats was able to induce a serum neutralising antibody response which lasted for the course of the experiment. Interestingly, in contrast to control animals, infectious virus could not be detected in oropharyngeal or nasal swabs of vaccinated cats after challenge. Moreover, the challenged control cats spread the virus to in-contact cats whereas the vaccinated cats did not transmit virus.

Because of their key roles, they constitute attractive targets for drug development. Here we present a high-throughput assay using fluorescence polarization to assess the viral exoribonuclease activity and its inhibition. We validate the assay using three different viral enzymes from SARS-CoV-2, lymphocytic choriomeningitis and Machupo viruses. The method is sensitive, robust, amenable to miniaturization (384 well plates) and allowed us to validate the proof-of-concept of the assay by screening a small focused compounds library (23 metal chelators).

Animal models can provide an opportunity to mechanistically interrogate causes of sex differences in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. Adult male and female golden Syrian hamsters (8-10 weeks of age) were inoculated intranasally with 105 TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2/USA-WA1/2020 and euthanized at several time points during the acute (i.e., virus actively replicating) and recovery (i.e., after the infectious virus has been cleared) phases of infection. There was no mortality, but infected male hamsters experienced greater morbidity, losing a greater percentage of body mass, developing more extensive pneumonia as noted on chest computed tomography, and recovering more slowly than females. Treatment of male hamsters with estradiol did not alter pulmonary damage. Virus titers in respiratory tissues, including nasal turbinates, trachea, and lungs, and pulmonary cytokine concentrations, including IFN{beta} and TNF, were comparable between the sexes. However, during the recovery phase of infection, females mounted two-fold greater IgM, IgG, and IgA responses against the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein (S-RBD) in both plasma and respiratory tissues. Female hamsters also had significantly greater IgG antibodies against whole inactivated SARS-CoV-2 and mutant S-RBDs, as well as virus neutralizing antibodies in plasma. The development of an animal model to study COVID-19 sex differences will allow for a greater mechanistic understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 associated sex differences seen in the human population.

ImportanceMen experience more severe outcomes from COVID-19 than women. Golden Syrian hamsters were used to explore sex differences in the pathogenesis of a human clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2. After inoculation, male hamsters experienced greater sickness, developed more severe lung pathology, and recovered more slowly than females. Sex differences in disease could not be reversed by estradiol treatment in males and were not explained by either virus replication kinetics or the concentrations of inflammatory cytokines in the lungs. During the recovery period, antiviral antibody responses in the respiratory tract and plasma, including to newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, were greater in females than male hamsters. Greater lung pathology during the acute phase combined with reduced antiviral antibody responses during the recovery phase of infection in males than females illustrate the utility of golden Syrian hamsters as a model to explore sex differences in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and vaccine-induced immunity and protection.

However, a large deletion causes the sequence to be automatically rejected from repositories, suggesting that the frequency of this new lineage is underestimated using public data. Recent dynamics based on 339 samples obtained in Santa Cruz County, CA, USA suggest that B.1.x may be increasing in frequency at a rate similar to that of B.1.1.7 in Southern California. At present the functional differences between this variant B.1.x and other circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants are unknown, and further studies on secondary attack rates, viral loads, immune evasion and/or disease severity are needed to determine if it poses a public health concern.

Here, we comprehensively characterize escape, breadth, and potency across a panel of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies targeting the receptor-binding domain (RBD), including S3094, the parental antibody of the late-stage clinical antibody VIR-7831. We observe a tradeoff between SARS-CoV-2 in vitro neutralization potency and breadth of binding across SARS-related coronaviruses.

We built a simplified computational model, called SpikePro, to predict the SARS-CoV-2 fitness from the amino acid sequence and structure of the spike protein. It contains three contributions: the viral transmissibility predicted from the stability of the spike protein, the infectivity computed in terms of the affinity of the spike protein for the ACE2 receptor, and the ability of the virus to escape from the human immune response based on the binding affinity of the spike protein for a set of neutralizing antibodies. Our model reproduces well the available experimental, epidemiological and clinical data on the impact of variants on the biophysical characteristics of the virus. For example, it is able to identify circulating viral strains that, by increasing their fitness, recently became dominant at the population level.

Conformational dynamics analysis revealed that binding-induced modulation of soft modes can elicit the unique protein response to different classes of antibodies. Mutational scanning heatmaps and sensitivity analysis revealed the binding energy hotspots for different classes of antibodies that are consistent with the experimental deep mutagenesis, showing that differences in the binding affinity caused by global circulating variants in spike positions K417, E484 and N501 are relatively moderate and may not fully account for the observed antibody resistance effects. Through functional dynamics analysis and perturbation-response scanning of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein residues in the unbound form and antibody-bound forms, we examine how antibody binding can modulate allosteric propensities of spike protein residues and determine allosteric hotspots that control signal transmission and global conformational changes. These results show that residues K417, E484, and N501 targeted by circulating mutations correspond to a group of versatile allosteric centers in which small perturbations can modulate collective motions, alter the global allosteric response and elicit binding resistance.

This is highlighted by the diverse modes of coronavirus entry into cells and their consequent differing pathogenicity that is of direct relevance to the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Host-expressed viral surface proteins bear post-translational modifications such as glycosylation that are essential for function but can confound or limit certain current biophysical methods used for dissecting key interactions. Several human coronaviruses attach to host cell-surface N-linked glycans that include forms of sialic acid. There remains, however, conflicting evidence as to if or how SARS-associated coronaviruses might use such a mechanism. Here, we show that novel protein NMR methods allow a complete and comprehensive analysis of the magnetization transfer caused by interactions between even heavily modified proteins and relevant ligands to generate quantitative binding data in a general manner. Our method couples direct, objective resonance-identification via a deconvolution algorithm with quantitative analysis using Bloch-McConnell equations to obtain interaction parameters (e.g. KD, kEx), which together enable structural modelling. By using an automated and openly available workflow, this method can be readily applied in a range of systems. This complete treatment of so-called  saturation transfer between protein and ligand now enables a general analysis of solution-phase ligand-protein binding beyond previously perceived limits of exchange rates, concentration or system - this allows  universal saturation transfer analysis (uSTA). uSTA proves critical in mapping direct interaction between natural sialoside sugar ligands and SARS-CoV-2-spike glycoprotein by quantitating ligand signal in spectral regions otherwise occluded by resonances from mobile spike-protein glycans (that also include sialosides). Using uSTA,  end on-binding by SARS-CoV-2-spike protein to sialoside glycan is revealed, which contrasts with an observed  extended surface-binding for previously validated heparin sugar ligands. Quantitative use of uSTA-derived restraints pinpoints likely binding modes to an intrinsically disordered region of the N-terminal domain of SARS-CoV-2-spike trimer. Consistent with this, glycan binding is minimally perturbed by antibodies that neutralize via binding the ACE2-binding domain (RBD) but strongly disrupted in the B1.1.7 and B1.351 variants-of-concern that possess hotspot mutations around the identified site. An analysis of beneficial genetic variances in cohorts of patients from early 2020 suggests a possible model in which A-lineage-SARS-CoV-2 may have exploited a specific sialylated-polylactosamine motif found on tetraantennary human N-linked-glycoproteins in deeper lung. Since cell-surface glycans are widely relevant to biology and pathology, uSTA can now provide a ready, quantitative method for widespread analysis of complex, host-derived and post-translationally modified proteins with putative ligands relevant to disease even in previously confounding complex systems.",1,166,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.14.439284v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.14.439284v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2021.04.14.439284.txt,1,field-specific repository,0,we modelled the structure of the n-terminal domain (ntd) on protein data bank (pdb) entry 7c2l 17 since it provided significantly better coverage of the area of interest when compared to the majority of the templates available on the pdb as of july 15th 2020.,NA

The susceptibility of immunity to viral evolution is shaped in part by the breadth of epitopes targeted. Here we compare the specificity of antibodies elicited by the mRNA-1273 vaccine versus natural infection. The neutralizing activity of vaccine-elicited antibodies is even more focused on the spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) than for infection-elicited antibodies. However, within the RBD, binding of vaccine-elicited antibodies is more broadly distributed across epitopes than for infection-elicited antibodies. This greater binding breadth means single RBD mutations have less impact on neutralization by vaccine sera than convalescent sera. Therefore, antibody immunity acquired by different means may have differing susceptibility to erosion by viral evolution.

Drug repurposing efforts are underway to identify compounds that interfere with SARS-CoV-2 replication or the immunopathology it can elicit. Rapamycin is among those being currently tested in clinical trials for impacts on COVID-19 severity. While rapamycin and rapamycin analogs (rapalogs) are FDA-approved for use as mTOR inhibitors in multiple clinical settings, including cancer, we previously found that rapamycin can increase the susceptibility of cells to infection by Influenza A virus. In this study, we tested the impact of rapalogs on cellular susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We report that rapamycin and rapalogs increased SARS-CoV-2 titers in human cervical epithelial and lung epithelial cell lines to different extents, and a similar pattern of enhancement was observed using pseudovirus incorporating viral fusion proteins from SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS, and Influenza A Virus. Rapalogs also promoted cell entry driven by SARS-CoV-2 Spike in nasal cells and primary small airway cells, representing proximal and distal ends of the human respiratory tract, respectively. Interestingly, cell entry enhancement by the rapalog ridaforolimus was cell type-dependent, revealing a previously unrecognized functional divergence between rapalogs. The differential activity of rapalogs was associated with their capacity to induce the degradation of interferon-inducible transmembrane (IFITM) proteins, restriction factors that broadly inhibit virus infection. Our findings will spur the development of mTOR inhibitors that do not suppress the cells first line of antiviral defense.

SignificanceDue to a lack of effective antivirals available to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection and the disease it causes (COVID-19), existing drugs that are clinically-approved for use in humans are being considered for deployment during this protracted pandemic. Rapamycin is an immunosuppressant that is administered to humans suffering from cancer, autoimmunity, atherosclerosis, and organ transplant rejection. While generally recognized for its inhibitory effects on the adaptive immune response, we previously showed that rapamycin can also impair intrinsic immunity, the immune system present within all cells of the body. Here, we show that rapamycin and rapamycin analogs (rapalogs) promote the first step of the SARS-CoV-2 infection cycle--entry into cells--by inducing the destruction of antiviral proteins that stand guard during virus invasion.",1,85,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.15.440067v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.15.440067v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2021.04.15.440067.txt,1,supplement,0,raw data is presented in supplemental file 1,NA

Here we analyzed 454,443 SARS-CoV-2 spike genes/proteins and 14,427 whole-genome sequences. We demonstrated that the early variant B.1.1.7 may not have evolved spontaneously in the United Kingdom or within human populations. Our extensive analyses suggested that Canidae, Mustelidae or Felidae, especially the Canidae family (for example, dog) could be a possible host of the direct progenitor of variant B.1.1.7. An alternative hypothesis is that the variant was simply yet to be sampled. Notably, the SARS-CoV-2 whole genome represents a large number of potential co-mutations with very strong statistical significances (p value<E- 44).

With this aim, we performed extensive molecular dynamics simulations on a selected set of possible Spike variants in order to assess the stabilizing effect of particular amino acid substitutions, with a special focus on the mutations that are both characteristic of the top three most worrying variants at the moment, i.e the English, South African and Amazonian ones, and that occur at the molecular interface between SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and its human ACE2 receptor. We characterize these variants effect in terms of (i) residues mobility, (ii) compactness, studying the network of interactions at the interface, and (iii) variation of shape complementarity via expanding the molecular surfaces in the Zernike basis. Overall, our analyses highlighted greater stability of the three variant complexes with respect to both the wild type and two negative control systems, especially for the English and Amazonian variants. In addition, in the three variants, we investigate the effects a not-yet observed mutation in position 501 could provoke on complex stability. We found that a phenylalanine mutation behaves similarly to the English variant and may cooperate in further increasing the stability of the South African one, hinting at the need for careful surveillance for the emergence of such kind of mutations in the population.

We previously showed that human proteins targeted by viruses tend to be those whose removal in a dhPPIN requires more control of the network dynamics, which were classified as indispensable nodes. In this study we introduce a more comprehensive rank-based enrichment analysis of our previous dhPPIN for SARS-CoV-2 infection and show that SARS-CoV-2 also tends to target indispensable nodes in the dhPPIN using multiple proteomics datasets, supporting validity and generality of controllability analysis of viral infection in humans. Also, we find differential controllability among SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, and MERS-CoV from a comparative proteomics study. Moreover, we show functional significance of indispensable nodes by analyzing heterogeneous datasets from a genome-wide CRISPR screening study, a time-course phosphoproteomics study, and a genome-wide association study. Specifically, we identify SARS-CoV-2 ORF3A as most frequently interacting with indispensable proteins in the dhPPIN, which are enriched in TGF-beta signaling and tend to be sources nodes and interact with each other. Finally, we built an integrated network model of ORF3A-interacting indispensable proteins with multiple functional supports to provide hypotheses for experimental validation as well as therapeutic opportunities.

These events involve a small number of virions at these mucosal barriers and are therefore a strategic point to stop a COVID-19 infection before it starts. Despite this, most vaccines against COVID-19 are being injected into the muscle where they will not generate the highest levels of mucosal protection. The vaccines that are approved for use in humans are all replication-defective (RD) mRNA, DNA, or adenovirus (Ad) vaccines that do not amplify antigen transgenes. We developed single cycle adenovirus (SC-Ad) vectors that replicate antigen genes up to 10,000-fold in human cells, but that are disabled from producing infectious Ad particles. We show here that SC-Ad expressing the full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike protein produces 100-fold more spike protein than a matched RD-Ad-Spike vector. When Ad-permissive hamsters were immunized with these vaccines by intranasal (IN) or intramuscular (IM) routes, SC-Ad produced significantly stronger antibody responses as compared to RD-Ad against the spike protein that rose over 14 weeks after one immunization. Single IN or IM immunizations generated significant antibody responses in serum and in bronchoalveolar lavages (BALs). IN priming, but not IM priming, generated HLA-restricted CD8 T cell responses in BALs. SC-Ad-Spike generated antibodies that retain binding to spike receptor binding domains (RBDs) with mutations from new viral variants. These data suggest empowering the genomes of gene-based vaccines with the ability to amplify antigen genes can increase potency. This may be particularly advantageous when applying mucosal vaccines to combat mucosal pathogens like SARS-CoV-2.

We conducted a multicentre cross-sectional study prospectively enrolling 115 COVID-19 patients categorized according to: 1) WHO Clinical Progression Scale - mild 19 (16.5%), moderate 37 (32.2%) or severe 59 (51.3%); and 2) location of recovery from COVID-19 - ambulatory 14 (household isolation; 12.2%), hospitalized in ward 40 (34.8%) or intensive care unit 61 (53.0%). Gut microbiota analysis was performed through 16S rRNA gene sequencing and data obtained was further related with clinical parameters of COVID-19 patients. Risk factors for COVID-19 severity were identified by univariate and multivariable logistic regression models.

In comparison with mild COVID-19 patients, the gut microbiota of moderate and severe patients has: a) lower Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio, b) higher abundance of Proteobacteria; and c) lower abundance of beneficial butyrate-producing bacteria such as Roseburia and Lachnospira genera.

Here, we reveal that an isoform of oligoadenylate synthetase 1, OAS1 p46, is prenylated and targeted to the endomembrane system. Membrane localization of OAS1 p46 confers enhanced access to viral replication sites and results in increased antiviral activity against a subset of RNA viruses including flavivirus, picornavirus, and SARS-CoV-2. Finally, our human genetic analysis shows that the OAS1 splice-site SNP responsible for production of the OAS1 p46 isoform strongly associates with COVID-19 severity.

We show that the HLT model preserves its main cell populations, maintains the expression of proteins required for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and identifies alveolar type II (AT-II) cells as the most susceptible cell targets for SARS-CoV-2 in the human lung. Antiviral testing of 39 drug candidates revealed a highly reproducible system, and provided the identification of new compounds missed by conventional systems such as VeroE6. Using this model, we also show that interferons do not modulate ACE2 expression, and that stimulation of local inflammatory responses can be modulated by different compounds with antiviral activity.

Over the course of the current pandemic, evidence has mounted that infected humans can transmit the virus to animals including household pets, however the frequency of and risk factors for this transmission remain unclear. We carried out a community-based study of pets in households with one or more confirmed SARS-CoV-2 case among the human residents, and report here on interim findings from sampling of dogs.

MethodsData collection included a survey of human and animal demographic and clinical variables, features of their shared environment, and human-animal contact; blood collection from animals for serology for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies; and nasopharyngeal sampling for PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2.

ResultsSampling consisted of 67 dogs from 46 households. Nasopharyngeal PCR testing results were available for 58 dogs, and serological testing results were available for 51. Clinical signs consistent with COVID-19 were reported in 14 dogs (23.7%, 95% CI 0.13, 0.35), and SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing using viral receptor binding domain ELISA was positive in 22 dogs (43.1%, 95% CI 0.30, 0.57). All PCR tests of nasopharyngeal swabs were negative. Survey respondents commonly reported close human-animal contact, and the majority of households were aware of and adopted measures to mitigate human-to-animal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 following diagnosis. While no statistically significant associations were detected between human-animal contact variables and either seropositivity or COVID-19 like illness in dogs, positive trends were found for sharing beds with humans and the number of SARS-CoV-2 positive humans in the corresponding household. Reported measures taken by the household to mitigate transmission showed a protective trend, and COVID-19 like illness in a dog was positively associated with seropositivity in that dog.

DiscussionThese data indicate that human-to-animal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in households is common, in a study population characterized by close human-animal contact. They also indicate that infected pets often manifest signs of COVID-like illness. While nasopoharyngeal sampling of dogs in this study has not to date demonstrated positive PCR results, this could be due to delays in sampling. Household members reported taking precautions to protect pets from SARS-CoV-2 infection, indicating an opportunity for further measures to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between people and animals sharing households.",1,72,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.24.440952v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.24.440952v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2021.04.24.440952.txt,1,general-purpose repository,1,431 432  data statement  433  de-identified data and code will be made available in a github repository prior to publication.,431 432  data statement  433  de-identified data and code will be made available in a github repository prior to publication.

They are clinically validated and thus represent a true alternative to classical immunoglobulin formats. In contrast to immunoglobulins, they are built from solenoid protein domains comprising an N-terminal capping repeat, one or more internal repeats and a C-terminal capping repeat. By using in silico analysis and a rationally guided Ala-Scan, we identified position 17 of the N-terminal capping repeat to play a key role for the overall protein thermostability. The melting temperature of a DARPin domain with a single full-consensus internal repeat was increased by about 8{degrees}C to 10{degrees}C when the original Asp17 was replaced by Leu, Val, Ile, Met, Ala or Thr, as shown by high-temperature unfolding experiments at equilibrium. We then transferred the Asp17Leu mutation to various backgrounds, including different N- and C-terminal capping repeats and clinically validated DARPin domains, such as the VEGF-binding ankyrin repeat domain of abicipar pegol. In all cases, the proteins remained monomeric and showed improvements in the thermostability of about 8{degrees}C to 16{degrees}C. Thus, the replacement of Asp17 seems to be generically applicable to this drug class. Molecular dynamics simulations show that the Asp17Leu mutation reduces electrostatic repulsion and improves van-der-Waals packing, rendering the DARPin domain less flexible and more stable. Interestingly, such a beneficial Asp17Leu mutation is present in the N-terminal caps of three of the five DARPin domains of ensovibep, a SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitor currently in clinical development. This mutation is likely responsible, at least in part, for the very high melting temperature (>90{degrees}C) of this promising anti-Covid-19 drug.

Here, we demonstrate the neutralization of SARS-CoV, bat CoVs WIV-1 and RsSHC014, and SARS-CoV-2 variants D614G, B.1.1.7, B.1.429, B1.351 by a receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific antibody DH1047. Prophylactic and therapeutic treatment with DH1047 demonstrated protection against SARS-CoV, WIV-1, RsSHC014, and SARS-CoV-2 B1.351infection in mice. Binding and structural analysis showed high affinity binding of DH1047 to an epitope that is highly conserved among Sarbecoviruses. We conclude that DH1047 is a broadly neutralizing and protective antibody that can prevent infection and mitigate outbreaks caused by SARS-like strains and SARS-CoV-2 variants.

The diarrhea does not appear to account for the disease mortality and its contribution to the morbidity has not been defined, even though it is a component of Long Covid or post-infectious aspects of the disease. Even less is known about the pathophysiologic mechanism of the diarrhea. To begin to understand the pathophysiology of COVID-19 diarrhea, we exposed human enteroid monolayers obtained from five healthy subjects and made from duodenum, jejunum, and proximal colon to live SARS-CoV-2 and virus like particles (VLPs) made from exosomes expressing SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins (Spike, Nucleocapsid, Membrane and Envelope). Results: 1) Live virus was exposed apically for 90 min, then washed out and studied 2 and 5 days later. SARS-Cov-2 was taken up by enteroids and live virus was present in lysates and in the apical>>basolateral media of polarized enteroids 48 h after exposure. This is the first demonstration of basolateral appearance of live virus after apical exposure. High vRNA concentration was detected in cell lysates and in the apical and basolateral media up to 5 days after exposure. 2) Two days after viral exposure, cytokine measurements of media showed significantly increased levels of IL-6, IL-8 and MCP-1. 3) Two days after viral exposure, mRNA levels of ACE2, NHE3 and DRA were reduced but there was no change in mRNA of CFTR. NHE3 protein was also decreased. 4) Live viral studies were mimicked by some studies with VLP exposure for 48 h. VLPs with Spike-D614G bound to the enteroid apical surface and was taken up; this resulted in decreased mRNA levels of ACE2, NHE3, DRA and CFTR. 4) VLP effects were determined on active anion secretion measured with the Ussing chamber/voltage clamp technique. S-D614G acutely exposed to apical surface of human ileal enteroids did not alter the short-circuit current (Isc). However, VLPS-D614G exposure to enteroids that were pretreated for [~]24 h with IL-6 plus IL-8 induced a concentration dependent increase in Isc indicating stimulated anion secretion, that was delayed in onset by [~]8 min. The anion secretion was inhibited by apical exposure to a specific calcium activated Cl channel (CaCC) inhibitor (AO1) but not by a specific CFTR inhibitor (BP027); was inhibited by basolateral exposure to the K channel inhibit clortimazole; and was prevented by pretreatment with the calcium buffer BAPTA-AM. 5) The calcium dependence of the VLP-induced increase in Isc was studied in Caco-2/BBe cells stably expressing the genetically encoded Ca2+ sensor GCaMP6s. 24 h pretreatment with IL-6/IL-8 did not alter intracellular Ca2+. However, in IL-6/IL-8 pretreated cells, VLP S-D614G caused appearance of Ca2+waves and an overall increase in intracellular Ca2+ with a delay of [~]10 min after VLP addition. We conclude that the diarrhea of COVID-19 appears to an example of a calcium dependent inflammatory diarrhea that involves both acutely stimulated Ca2+ dependent anion secretion (stimulated Isc) that involves CaCC and likely inhibition of neutral NaCl absorption (decreased NHE3 protein and mRNA and decreased DRA mRNA).",1,147,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.27.441695v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.27.441695v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2021.04.27.441695.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Assessment of a SARS -CoV-2 spike ferritin nanoparticle (SpFN) immunogen paired with two distinct adjuvants, Alhydrogel(R) (AH) or Army Liposome Formulation containing QS-21 (ALFQ) demonstrated unique vaccine evoked immune signatures. SpFN+ALFQ enhanced recruitment of highly activated classical and non -classical antigen presenting cells (APCs) to the vaccine-draining lymph nodes of mice. The multifaceted APC response of SpFN+ALFQ vaccinated mice was associated with an increased frequency of polyfunctional spike -specific T cells with a bias towards TH1 responses and more robust SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific recall response. In addition, SpFN+ALFQ induced Kb spike(539-546)-specific memory CD8+ T cells with effective cytolytic function and distribution to the lungs. This epitope is also present in SARS-CoV, thus suggesting that generation of cross-reactive T cells may provide protection against other coronavirus strains.
