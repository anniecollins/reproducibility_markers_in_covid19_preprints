Abstract

24

The outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus

25

continually lead to worldwide human infections and deaths. It is currently no specific viral protein

26

targeted therapeutics yet. Viral nucleocapsid protein is a potential antiviral drug target, serving

27

multiple critical functions during the viral life cycle. However, the structural information of SARS-

28

CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein is yet to be clear. Herein, we have determined the 2.7 Å crystal

29

structure of the N-terminal RNA binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein.

30

Although overall structure is similar with other reported coronavirus nucleocapsid protein N-

31

terminal domain, the surface electrostatic potential characteristics between them are distinct.

32

Further comparison with mild virus type HCoV-OC43 equivalent domain demonstrates a unique

33

potential RNA binding pocket alongside the b-sheet core. Complemented by in vitro binding

34

studies, our data provide several atomic resolution features of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid

35

protein N-terminal domain, guiding the design of novel antiviral agents specific targeting to

36

SARS-CoV-2.

Introduction

41

The ongoing outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new emerging human

42

infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus

43

2, SARS-CoV-2, previously known as 2019-nCoV). As of 28 February 2020, a cumulative total of

44

78,961 COVID-19 cases were confirmed with 2791 deaths in China. The emerged global

45

epidemic spread rapidly with 4691 confirmed cases and 67 deaths across 51 countries outside

46

of China (COVID-19 situation Report WHO, 28 Feb 2020). Despite remarkable efforts on

47

containing spread of the virus, there is no specific targeted therapeutic currently.

48

SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus with single-stranded RNA genomes, like MERS-CoV and

49

SARS-CoV. The first two-thirds of viral 30kb RNA genome, mainly named as ORF1a/b region,

50

translates into two polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab) and encodes most of the non-structural

51

proteins (nsp). The rest parts of virus genome encode accessory proteins and four essential

52

structural proteins, including spike (S) glycoprotein, small envelope (E) protein, matrix (M)

53

protein, and nucleocapsid (N) protein1,2. Current antiviral drugs developed to treat coronavirus

54

(CoV) infections primarily target S protein, the 3C-like (3CL) and papain-like (PLP) proteases3,4.

55

Because mutant viruses in the S protein is prone to escape the targeted therapeutic with

56

different host-cell receptor binding patterns4, as well as antibody-dependent enhancement

57

(ADE) effects of S protein antibodies are found in MERS coronavirus5, there are several limitations

58

on targeting S protein for antiviral approaches. Antiviral protease inhibitors may nonspecifically

59

act on the cellular homologous protease, resulting in host cell toxicity and severe side effects.

60

Therefore, novel antiviral strategies are needed to combat acute respiratory infections caused

61

by this novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.

62

The CoV N protein is a multifunctional RNA-binding protein necessary for viral RNA

63

transcription and replication. It plays many pivotal roles in forming helical ribonucleoproteins

64

during packaging the RNA genome, regulating viral RNA synthesis during replication,

65

transcription and modulating infected cell metabolism6-8. The primary functions of N protein are

66

binding to the viral RNA genome, and packing them into a long helical nucleocapsid structure

67

or ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex9,10. In vitro and in vivo experiments revealed that N protein

68

bound to leader RNA, and was critical for maintaining highly ordered RNA conformation suitable

69

for replicating, and transcribing the viral genome7,11. More studies implicated that N protein

70

regulated host-pathogen interactions, such as actin reorganization, host cell cycle progression,

71

and apoptosis12-14. The N protein is also a highly immunogenic and abundantly expressed protein

72

during infection, capable of inducing protective immune responses against SARS-CoV and

73

SARS-CoV-215-18.

74

The common domain architectures of coronavirus N protein are consisting of three distinct but

75

highly conserved parts: An N-terminal RNA-binding domain (NTD), a C-terminal dimerization

76

domain (CTD), and intrinsically disordered central Ser/Arg (SR)-rich linker. Previous studies have

77

revealed that the NTD are responsible for RNA binding, CTD for oligomerization, and (SR)-rich

78

linker for primary phosphorylation, respectively19-23. The crystal structures of SARS-CoV N-NTD24,

79

infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) N-NTD25,26, HCoV-OC43 N-NTD20 and mouse hepatitis virus

80

(MHV) N-NTD27 have been solved. The CoVs N-NTD have been found to associate with the 3'

81

end of the viral RNA genome, possibly through electrostatic interactions. Additionally, several

82

critical residues have been identified for RNA binding and virus infectivity in the N-terminal

83

domain of coronavirus N proteins24,27-29. However, the structural and mechanistic basis for newly

84

emerged novel SARS-CoV-2 N protein remain largely unknown. Understanding these aspects

85

should facilitate the discovery of agents that specifically block the coronavirus replication,

86

transcription and viral assembly30.

87

At present work, we report the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid N-terminal

88

domain (termed as SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD), as a model for understanding the molecular

89

interactions that govern SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD binding to ribonucleotides. Compared with other

90

solved CoVs N-NTD, we characterized the specificity surface electrostatic potential features of

91

SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD. Additionally, we further demonstrated the unique RNA binding site

92

characteristics. Our findings will aid in the development of new drugs that interfere with viral N

93

protein and viral replication in SARS-CoV-2, and highly related virus SARS-CoV.

98

CoV-2 N-NTD domain (residues from 41 to 174) and SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD domain (residues

99

from 33 to 180) depending on secondary structure predictions and sequence conservation

100

characteristics. The constructs were cloned into the pRSF-Duet-1 vector with N-terminal 6xHis-

101

SUMO tag and expressed in E. coli strain Rosetta. SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD was induced with 0.1mM

102

IPTG and incubated overnight at 16 °C in TB media. After Ni column chromatography followed

103

by Ulp1 protease digestion for tag removal, SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD (41-174) proteins were further

104

purified via size-exclusion chromatography (with buffer consisting of 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0),

105

150 mM sodium chloride, 1 mM dithiothreitol), and then concentrated by ultrafiltration to a final

106

concentration of 22 mg/mL.

107

Crystallization and data collection Crystals were grown by the sitting drop method with 0.3ul

108

protein（22 mg/mL） mixed with 0.6 μL and 0.3 μL well solution using Mosquito crystallization

109

robot and after 3 days initial crystallization was performed under 16 °C under 20 mM sodium

110

acetate, 100 mM sodium cacodylate (pH 6.5), 26 % PEG8000 conditions. Crystals were frozen in

111

liquid nitrogen in reservoir solution supplemented with 15 % glycerol (v/v) as a cryoprotectant.

112

X-ray diffraction data were collected at the South China Sea Institute of Oceanology, Chinese

113

Academy of Sciences by Rigaku X-ray diffraction (XRD) instruments. The structure was solved

114

by molecular replacement using PHENIX software suite31. The X-ray diffraction and structure

115

refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1.

116

SPR Analysis. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis was performed using a Biacore T200

117

with the CM5 sensor chip (GE Healthcare) at room temperature (25 °C). SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD

118

(41–174) were exchanged into PBS buffer via gel-filtration. The CM5 chip surface was activated

119

for 10 min using 0.2 M EDC/ 0.05 M NHS. After the injection of 30 μg/mL protein in 10 mM

120

sodium acetate (pH 5.5) for three times to immobilize on one of channels of the CM5 chip up

121

to ∼5,800 response units, 10 μL of 1 M ethanolamine (pH 8.0) was used for blocking the

122

remaining activated groups. Each of the analytes (AMP, GMP, UMP, CMP) were dissolve in PBS

123

(pH 7.4, 0.05 % NP-20) and flowed through the chip surface at flow rate of 30 μL/min at 25 °C.

124

30 μL analytes were injected for affinity analysis with 60 s dissociation time. To understanding

125

dose dependent affinity of analytes and SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD, we tested nine dilutions of

126

analytes from 0.15625 mM to 10 mM. A blank flow channel was used as a reference channel to

127

correct the bulk refractive index by subtracting the response signal of the reference channel

128

from the signals of protein immobilized cells. The equilibrium constant (KD) for analytes binding

129

to SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD was determined from the association and dissociation curves of the

130

sensorgrams, using the BIAevaluation program (Biacore).

Sequence features of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein

133

It is reported that the complete genome of SARS-CoV-2 (MN908947, Wuhan-Hu-1 coronavirus)

134

is 29.9 kb in length, similarly to 27.9 kb SARS-CoV and 30.1 kb MERS-CoV genome32,33 (Fig. 1A).

135

Nucleocapsid (N) protein is translated from the 3’ end structural ORF34-36. According to Virus

136

Variation Resource in National Center for Biotechnology Information databank37, SARS-CoV-2

137

N protein encoding region are conserved among the known NCBI 103 genome datasets. Only

138

a few variations (S194L in virus strain Foshan/20SF207/2020, K249I in virus strain Wuhan/IVDC-

139

HB-envF13-21/2020, P344S in virus strain Guangzhou/20SF206/2020) in N protein are found in

140

public genomic epidemiology. An overall domain architecture of N protein among four

141

coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and HCoV-OC43) are shown in Figure 1B,

142

which indicates that SARS-CoV-2 shares typical characteristics with other coronaviruses. Zoom

143

into the completed genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 N protein encoding region, we find that

144

the sequence identities between SARS-CoV-2 with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and HCoV-OC43

145

are 89.74%, 48.59%, 35.62%, respectively (Fig. S1)38,39. Since full-length SARS-CoV-2 N protein

146

aggregated status were found in our expression and purification studies (Fig. S2), as well as

147

previous reported data on other coronavirus nucleocapsid protein, we next investigate the

148

structural studies on N-terminal region of SARS-CoV-2 N protein (termed as SARS-CoV-2 N-

149

NTD).

Crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD

151

In order to obtain the atomic information of SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD, we solve the structure at 2.7

152

Å resolution using X-ray crystallography technology. Briefly, 47-173 residues of SARS-CoV-2 N

153

protein were constructed, expressed and purified as described protocol (Materials and Methods).

154

The structure of SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD was determined by molecular replacement using the

155

SARS-CoV N-NTD structure (PDB:2OG3) as the search model24. The final structure was refined

156

to R-factor and R-free values of 0.26 and 0.29, respectively. The complete statistics for data

157

collection, phasing and refinement are presented in Table 1. Unlike to SARS-CoV N-NTD crystals

158

packing modes (monoclinic form at 2OFZ, cubic form at 2OG3)24, SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD crystal

159

shows orthorhombic crystal packing form with four N-NTD monomers in one asymmetry unit

160

(Fig. 2A). Although lacks of evidence for real RNP organization in the mature virions, the

161

differences in the crystal packing patterns may implicate other potential contacts in SARS-CoV-

162

2 RNP formation process. All four monomers in one asymmetric unit of the SARS-CoV-2 N-

163

NTD crystal structure shared similar right-handed (loops)-(b-sheet core)-(loops) sandwiched

164

structure, as conserved among the CoVs N-NTD (Fig. 2B). The b-sheet core is consisted of five

165

antiparallel b-strands with a single short 310 helix just before strand b2, and a protruding b-

166

hairpin between strands b2 and b5. The b-hairpin is functionally important for CoV N-NTD,

167

implicated in mutational analysis of amino acid residues for RNA binding29 (Fig. 2C). The SARS-

168

CoV-2 N-NTD is enriched in aromatic and basic residues, folding into a hand shape resembles

169

with basic fingers that extend far beyond the b-sheet core, a basic palm, and an acidic wrist (Fig.

170

2D).

171

Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD with related viral N-NTD structures

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.06.977876; this version posted March 11, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

172

To obtain more specific information, we first mapped the conserved residues between SARS-

173

CoV-2 N-NTD with SARS-CoV N-NTD, MERS-CoV N-NTD, HCoV-OC443 N-NTD, respectively

174

(Fig 3A). The most conserved residues distribute on the basic palm region (Fig. 3A, blue and

175

green region), while the less conserved residues locate in basic fingers and acidic wrist region

176

(Fig. 3A, pink and red region). The available CoVs N-NTD crystal structures allowed us to

177

compare the electrostatic potential on the surface. As shown in Fig. 3B, although CoV N-NTDs

178

all adapted similar overall organizations, the surface charge distribution patterns are different.

179

Consisting with our observations, previous modeling of related coronaviral N-NTDs also shown

180

markedly differ in surface charge distributions24. Superimposition of SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD with

181

three kinds of CoVs N-NTD are shown in Fig. 3C. Compared with SARS-CoV N-NTD, SARS-

182

CoV-2 N-NTD show a 2.1 Å movement in the b-hairpin region forward to nucleotide binding

183

site (Fig. 3C, left panel). While compared with MERS-CoV N-NTD, SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD show a

184

less extended b-hairpin region, and a distinct relax N-treminal tail (Fig. 3C, middle panel). In

185

consistently, SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD show a distinct relax N-treminal tail, and a 2 Å movement in

186

the b-hairpin region backward to the opposite side of nucleotide binding site when the structure

187

is compared with HCoV-OC43 N-NTD (Fig. 3C, right panel). These differences dramatically

188

change the surface characterizations of the protein, may result in the RNA-binding cleft being

189

adaptive to its own RNA genome.

190

A potential unique drug target pocket in SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD

191

Although there are several CoV N-NTDs structures have been solved, the structural basis for

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.06.977876; this version posted March 11, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

192

ribonucleoside 5’-monophosphate binding of N protein had only been described in HCoV-

193

OC43, a relative type typically causing mild cold symptoms40. Since the surface characterizations

194

of N-NTD between SARS-CoV-2 with HCoV-OC43 are distinct, we next explored the differences

195

of RNA binding mechanistic basis with superimposition analysis. Previous studies had shown

196

that,

197

monophosphate (UMP)/ cytosine monophosphate (CMP)/ guanosine monophosphate (GMP)

198

binding site alongside the middle two b strands of its b-sheets core40. In the complex structure

199

of HCoV-OC43 N-NTD with ribonucleotides, the phosphate group was bound by Arg 122 and

200

Gly 68 via ionic interactions, the pentose sugar ribose 2’-hydroxyl group was recognized by

201

Ser 64 and Arg164, the nitrogenous base inserted into a hydrophobic pocket consisting of Phe

202

57, Pro61, Tyr 63, Tyr102, Tyr 124, and Tyr 126, mainly interacted with Tyr 124 via p-p stacking

203

forces (Fig. S3). It is proposed that this ribonucleotide binding mechanism are essential for all

204

coronavirus N proteins, applying to develop CoV N-NTD-target agents.

205

To obtain the structure information of SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD ribonucleotide binding site, we

206

make a superimposition of SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD with HCoV-OC43 N-NTD-AMP complex. As

207

expectedly, the root mean square deviation (RMSD) between these two structure coordinates

208

are 1.4 Å over 136 superimposed Ca atoms. However, a number of difference around the

209

ribonucleotide binding site were shown as superimposition of SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD with HCoV-

210

OC43 N-NTD. The major difference is N-terminal tail of N-NTD with sequence variation (SARS-

211

CoV-2: 48 NNTA 51 versus HCoV-OC43: 60 VPYY 63). In HCoV-OC43 N-NTD, the tail folded

212

up to compose a nitrogenous base binding channel, whereas this region extended outward in

HCoV-OC43

N-NTD

contained

Adenosine

monophosphate

(AMP)/

uridine

213

SARS-CoV-2 one (Fig. 4A). The N-terminal tail movement contributed to the change of N-NTD

214

surface charge distribution, at which nucleotide binding cavity became easier to accessible in

215

SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD (Fig. 4B and C). The second difference is on phosphate group binding site,

216

which SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD have larger sidechain residues (55 TA 56) compared with HCoV-

217

OC43 N-NTD equivalents (67 SG 68) (Fig. 4D). Structural superimposition suggested additional

218

polar properties of Thr 55 and Ala 56 in SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD may increase the steric clash with

219

ribonucleotide phosphate moiety (Fig. 4E and F). The third difference is on the edge of

220

nitrogenous base recognized hydrophobic pocket, where SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD had Arg 89

221

residues compared with HCoV-OC43 N-NTD Tyr 102 equivalents (Fig. 4G). The change of these

222

residues sidechain may lead to dramatic decreasing of non-polar properties and increasing of

223

polar properties in the nitrogenous base binding site (Fig. 4H and I). To evaluate these different

224

observations in our structure, Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis experiments were next

225

performed to assess the binding affinity between SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD with all four kinds of

226

ribonucleotide AMP/UMP/CMP/GMP. Intriguingly, all ribonucleoside 5’-monophosphate,

227

excepted for GMP (KD value is 8 mM), shown little binding signals in assays (Fig. S4). Taken

228

together, the above results suggested a potential distinct RNA binding patterns between SARS-

229

CoV-2 N protein with HCoV-OC43 N protein.

230

Discussion

231

Structure-based drug discovery has been shown to be an advance approach for the

232

development of new therapeutics. Many ongoing studies are developed to treat COVID-19

233

primarily targeting the spike protein, viral proteases (3C-like protease and papain-like protease).

234

However, there is little effective targeted therapeutic currently. Recent studies demonstrated

235

that N proteins will be a good drug-targeting candidate in other CoVs since they process several

236

critical functions, such as RNA genomic packing, viral transcription and assembly, in the

237

infectious cell10. However, the molecular basis of SARS-CoV-2 N protein is yet to be elucidated.

238

Here, we present the 2.7 Å crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 N protein N-terminal domain,

239

revealing the specific surface charge distributions which may facilitate drug discovery specifically

240

to SARS-CoV-2 N protein ribonucleotide binding domain.

241

On the structural basis of SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD, several residues in the ribonucleotide binding

242

domain were found to distinctly recognize the CoV RNA substrates. The N-terminal tail residues

243

(Asn 48, Asn 49, Thr 50, and Ala 51) is more flexible and extended outward compared with

244

equivalent residues in HCoV-OC43 N-NTD, possibly opening up the binding pocket into fitting

245

Up to date, seven coronaviruses have been identified as human-susceptible virus, among which

250

HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 with low pathogenicity cause mild

251

respiratory symptoms similar to common cold, whereas the other three betacoronaviruses,

252

SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV lead to severe and potential fatal respiratory tract

infections32,41,42. Previous study reported the structural basis of HCoV-OC43 N-NTD with AMP,

254

GMP, UMP, CMP and a virtual screening-base compound PJ34. However, our data suggested

255

that SARS-CoV-2 employed a unique pattern for binding RNA with atomic resolution

256

information. The structure not only help us to understand the RNA-binding mechanisms

257

between severe infectious coronavirus with mild infectious one, but also guide the design of

258

novel antiviral agents specific targeting to SARS-CoV-2.
