Summary

34

There are no known cures or vaccines for COVID-19, the defining pandemic of this era. Animal

35

models are essential to fast track new interventions and nonhuman primate (NHP) models of

36

other infectious diseases have proven extremely valuable. Here we compare SARS-CoV-2

37

infection in three species of experimentally infected NHPs (rhesus macaques, baboons, and

38

marmosets). During the first 3 days, macaques developed clinical signatures of viral infection and

39

systemic inflammation, coupled with early evidence of viral replication and mild-to-moderate

40

interstitial and alveolar pneumonitis, as well as extra-pulmonary pathologies. Cone-beam CT

41

scans showed evidence of moderate pneumonia, which progressed over 3 days. Longitudinal

42

studies showed that while both young and old macaques developed early signs of COVID-19, both

43

groups recovered within a two-week period. Recovery was characterized by low-levels of viral

44

persistence in the lung, suggesting mechanisms by which individuals with compromised immune

45

systems may be susceptible to prolonged and progressive COVID-19. The lung compartment

46

contained a complex early inflammatory milieu with an influx of innate and adaptive immune

47

cells, particularly interstitial macrophages, neutrophils and plasmacytoid dendritic cells, and a

48

prominent Type I-interferon response. While macaques developed moderate disease, baboons

49

exhibited prolonged shedding of virus and extensive pathology following infection; and

50

marmosets demonstrated a milder form of infection. These results showcase in critical detail, the

51

robust early cellular immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, which are not sterilizing and

52

likely impact development of antibody responses. Thus, various NHP genera recapitulate

53

heterogeneous progression of COVID-19. Rhesus macaques and baboons develop different,

54

quantifiable disease attributes making them immediately available essential models to test new

55

vaccines and therapies.

Main

58

A novel coronavirus, designated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),

59

emerged in Wuhan, China in 2019, and was proven to be the cause of an unspecified pneumonia.

60

It has since spread globally, causing Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) 1. The World Health

61

Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic. It is clear that community spread of SARS-

62

CoV-2 is occurring rapidly and the virus has very high infectivity and transmission rates, even

63

compared to SARS-CoV-1, the causative agent of an outbreak 15 years earlier. It has been

64

estimated that between up to 250,000 American lives may be lost due to COVID-19. The world

65

over, these numbers could be 10-50 times worse. Clearly, COVID-19 is the most defining

66

pandemic of this era, requiring significant biomedical research input, in order to most effectively

67

fast track the development of new therapies and vaccines.

68
69

Human COVID-19 disease presents with a broad clinical spectrum ranging from asymptomatic to

70

mild and severe cases. Patients with COVID pneumonia exhibit high-grade pyrexia, fatigue,

71

dyspnea and dry cough accompanied by a rapidly progressing pneumonia, with bilateral opacities

72

on x-ray and patchy, ground glass opacities on lung Computed Tomography (CT) scans. Individuals

73

with immunocompromised conditions and comorbidities are at highest risk for worse outcomes

74

of COVID-19.

75
76

Nonhuman primate (NHP) models of infectious diseases have proven useful for both investigating

77

the pathogenesis of infection and testing therapeutic and vaccine candidates 2. During the SARS

78

and MERS outbreaks, NHP models were developed with a moderate degree of success3. Early

79

reports also indicate the utility of NHPs for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and for evaluating vaccine

80

candidates4,5,6,7. We hypothesized that the heterogeneity of human responses to SARS-CoV-2

81

infection can be recapitulated using multiple NHP species. Furthermore, we sought to gain a

82

detailed characterization of the early cellular immune events following SARS-CoV-2 infection in

83

the lung compartment, which has not yet been reported. Here, we compare SARS-CoV-2 infection

84

in three species of NHPs (Specific Pathogen-free [SPF] Indian rhesus macaques, African-origin

85

baboons, and New-World origin common marmosets). We assess age as a variable and focus our

86

studies on high resolution imaging and the critical nature of the early cellular immune response

87

in the lung which likely impacts disease outcome.

Early events in SARS-CoV-2 infection in rhesus macaques

90

We first assessed the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to infect rhesus macaques during an acute 3-day

91

infection study. Four Indian-origin mycobacteria- and SPF-naïve rhesus macaques (Macaca

92

mulatta) (Table S1) were infected by multiple routes (ocular, intratracheal and intranasal) with

93

sixth-passage virus at a target dose of 1.05x106 PFU/per animal. All animals developed clinical

94

signs of viral infection as evidenced by a doubling of serum C-Reactive Protein (CRP) levels

95

relative to baseline, indicating systemic inflammation (Fig 1a); significantly decreased serum

96

albumin (Fig 1b) and hemoglobin (Fig 1c) levels, indicating viral-induced anemia; and

97

progressively increasing total serum CO2 levels (Fig S1a) indicative of pulmonary dysfunction.

98

These observations were accompanied by a decrease in red blood cells (RBCs) (Fig S1b),

99

reticulocytes (Fig S1c), white blood cells (WBCs) (Fig S1d), and platelet counts (Fig S1e); and a

100

decrease in both the total number and percentage of neutrophils (Fig S1f, g), the latter suggesting

101

that neutrophils are recruited to the lung compartment in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection as

102

first responders. In contrast, systemic influx of monocytes was observed, indicating viral

103

infection-induced myelopoiesis (Fig S1h). Monocytes are crucial for successful antiviral responses

104

via recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns, thereby initiating a signaling cascade

105

that invokes an interferon response to control infections. No significant pyrexia or weight loss

106

was observed in this acute study. Overall, our results suggest that rhesus macaques develop

107

several clinical signs of viral infection following experimental exposure to SARS-CoV-2.

109

Viral RNA was detected in BAL, and from nasal or nasopharyngeal (NS) and buccopharyngeal (BS)

110

swabs at 1-3 days post-infection (dpi), but not at pre-infection time points (Fig 1d-f). Viral RNA

111

was also detected in saliva and from rectal swabs (RS) in a small subset of animals (Fig S1i-j).

112

Unlike other samples, viral RNA was only detected in RS at later time points (i.e., after 1 dpi). At

113

necropsy (3 dpi), we performed random sampling from every lung lobe and SARS-CoV-2 RNA

114

could be detected in 23/24 total lung sections analyzed. An average of 4-6 log copies/100 mg of

115

lung tissue could be detected from every lobe (Fig 1g). The ~4-log increase in viral RNA from 1 to

116

2 dpi in the BAL (Fig 1d) provided clear evidence of early active replication of SARS-CoV-2 in

117

rhesus macaques.

118
119

Examination at necropsy (3 dpi) revealed findings of interstitial and alveolar pneumonia (Fig 1h,

120

i). While gross appearance of the lungs of most infected animals was unremarkable (Fig S2a),

121

multifocal to coalescing red discoloration of the left lung lobes in one macaque was observed (Fig

122

S2b). Table S2 summarizes the histopathologic findings in descending order of occurrence by

123

anatomic location. The lung was the most affected organ ((Fig 1h, i, Table S2, Fig S2). Multifocal,

124

mild to moderate interstitial pneumonia characterized by infiltrates of neutrophils, macrophages,

125

lymphocytes, and eosinophils was present in all four animals (Fig 1 i, Fig S2d, e, g, h), and was

126

accompanied by variable fibrosis (4/4, Fig S2e), fibrin deposition (3/4, Fig S2c), vasculitis (3/4, Fig

127

S2f), edema (2/4, Fig S2h), necrosis (Fig S2g), and areas of consolidation (2/4, Fig S2c). All four

128

macaques exhibited the following: 1) Syncytial cells in the epithelial lining and/or alveolar lumen

129

(Fig S2e, g, k); 2) Bronchitis characterized by infiltrates of eosinophils within the bronchial wall

and epithelium (Fig 1h, Fig S2i, j, k); Bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT) hyperplasia (Fig

131

S2i); and 4) Minimal to moderate lymphoplasmacytic and eosinophilic tracheitis and rhinitis.

132
133

The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in tissue sections collected at necropsy (3 dpi) was determined by

134

multi-label confocal immunofluorescence using antibodies specific for Nucleocapsid (N) (Fig 1j,

135

k, Fig S3) and Spike(S) proteins (Fig S4) and their respective isotype controls (Fig S3, S4).

136

Fluorescence immuno-histochemical analysis revealed the presence of SARS CoV-2 proteins in

137

lungs (Fig 1j, Fig S3a, g, Fig S4a, d, g, j), nasal epithelium (Fig 1k, Fig S3b, h, Fig S4b, e, h, k) and

138

tonsils (Fig S3c, i, Fig S4c, f, I, l). In all tissues, including lungs (Fig 1j, Fig S3 a, g), nasal epithelium

139

(Fig 1k, Fig S3 b, h) and tonsils (Fig S3 c, i), N antigen signal was present in cells expressing ACE2,

140

which has been shown to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, or in cells adjoining those expressing

141

ACE2. No signal was detected in N isotype control staining in lungs, nasal epithelium or tonsils

142

(Fig S3d-f), and no signal for viral antigen was detected in naïve tissues (Fig S3 m, n). It appeared

143

that the expression levels of ACE2 protein were much lower in lung tissues derived from naïve

144

animals compared to those from macaques exposed to SARS-CoV-2 (Fig S3 m, n). The majority of

145

the S signal was detected in the epithelial layer with discrete distribution throughout the lung

146

tissue (Fig S4a, d). In the nasal cavity, the virus was observed in cells of the epithelial linings (Fig

147

S4b, h) but in tonsils, the virus appeared distributed throughout the tissue (Fig 3c, i). Together,

148

these results show that SARS-CoV-2 exposure induces a respiratory tract infection in rhesus

149

macaques. Viral replication is supported in the upper and lower lung compartments during the

150

first three days of infection and viral antigens are detected at high levels in the lungs.

152

To complement the lung histopathology in rhesus macaques, radiographs were performed at

153

baseline and each day post-infection. All four infected macaques showed progressive increase in

154

CXR abnormality scores, consistent with an infectious disease (Fig 2a, Fig S5a). The 2 and 3 dpi

155

CXR scores were significantly elevated relative to baseline (Fig 2a), despite evidence of partial

156

resolution of specific lesions at 2 or 3 dpi versus 1 dpi (Fig S5a). There were mild-to-severe

157

multifocal interstitial-to-alveolar patterns with soft tissue opacities (seen as ground glass

158

opacities described in the CT scans below) in various lobes or diffusely in some animals, with

159

more severe abnormalities in the lower lung lobes, and with the most severe findings at 3 dpi

160

(Fig S5a). Pleural effusions were also observed.

161
162

Lung CT scans prior to infection showed a normal thorax cavity with the exception of atelectasis

163

(Fig 2b-d, top panel). Within 1 dpi, CT scans showed increased multifocal pulmonary infiltrates

164

with ground glass opacities in various lung lobes, linear opacities in the lung parenchyma, nodular

165

opacities in some lung lobes, and increased soft tissue attenuation extending primarily adjacent

166

to the vasculature (Fig 2c, Fig S5b-e). In some animals, multifocal alveolar pulmonary patterns

167

and interstitial opacities were observed in lobe subsections, with soft tissue attenuation and focal

168

border effacement with the pulmonary vasculature. Features intensified at 2-3 dpi, primarily in

169

the lung periphery, but also adjacent to the primary bronchus and the vasculature (Fig 2d, Fig

170

S5b). In other animals, progressive alveolar or interstitial pulmonary patterns were observed at

171

2 dpi (Fig 2c). While ground glass opacities in some lobes intensified at 2 dpi relative to 1 dpi,

172

others resolved (Fig S5c, d). In one animal, the individual nodular pattern at 1 dpi evolved to a

173

multifocal soft tissue nodular pattern in multiple lobes with associated diffuse ground glass

174

opacities (Fig S5d). At 3 dpi, persistent, patchy, fairly diffuse ground glass pulmonary opacities

175

existed in many lung lobes with multifocal nodular tendency (Fig S5e). Overall, CT abnormality

176

scores continuously increased at over the 3 days relative to baseline (Fig 2e). Percent change in

177

the hyperdensity volume was calculated using CT scans to quantify pathological changes over the

178

course of disease 8. We observed a significant increase in lung hyperdense areas between 1-3 dpi

179

compared to the baseline scans (Fig 2f-i). Measurement of volume involved in hyperdensity

180

showed a significant, progressive increase over time (Fig 2j). Pneumonia was evident in all

181

infected animals relative to their baseline (Fig 2j), suggesting that while some lesions formed and

182

resolved within the three-day infection protocol, others persisted or progressed. Together, CXR

183

and CT scans revealed moderate multi-lobe pneumonia in infected animals, confirming the

184

histopathology results (Fig 1h, i, Fig S2) in the very early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection in rhesus

185

macaques.

186
187

We measured the levels of pro-inflammatory, Type I cytokines in the BAL fluid (Fig 3) and plasma

188

(Fig S6a-l) of acutely infected rhesus macaques. Levels of IL-6 (Fig 3a), IFN-a (Fig 3b), IFN-g (Fig

189

3c), IL-8 (Fig 3d), perforin (Fig 3e), IP-10 (Fig 3f), MIP1-a (Fig 3g) and MIP1-b (Fig 3h) were all

190

significantly elevated in the BAL fluid. The levels of IL-12p40 (Fig 3i), IL-18 (Fig 3j), TNF (Fig 3k)

191

and IL-1Ra (Fig 3l) increased over time. Of particular interest was the elevation of Type I IFN-a

192

(Fig 3b), which has critical anti-viral activity including against SARS-CoV-2 9. Expression of a

193

downstream Type-I interferon-regulated gene IP-10 (CXCL-10), which promotes the recruitment

194

of CXCR3+ Th1 thymocytes, was also induced (Fig 3f). Therefore, we observed that rhesus

195

macaques mount an early anti-viral response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Type I IFNs and IL-6 (both

196

significantly expressed) are key components of a “cytokine-storm” which promote acute

197

respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) associated with both SARS-CoV-1 and -2, when induced

198

uncontrollably10. IFN-a and IP-10 were also significantly elevated in plasma samples at 2 and 3

199

dpi (Fig S6).

200
201

Thus, clinical, imaging, pathology and cytokine analyses provide evidence for an acute infection

202

in macaques following exposure to SARS-CoV-2, which leads to a moderate pneumonia and

203

pathology, with early activation of anti-viral responses. To study progression of infection, and

204

assess the effect of age on SARS-CoV-2 infection, we infected six young and six old Indian-origin

205

rhesus macaques as described above and longitudinally followed the outcome over 14-17 days

206

(Table S1). We included four macaques as procedural controls, which were sham-infected and

207

underwent all procedures (with the exception of necropsy) to control for the impact of multiple

208

procedures over the course of the study (Table S1). We also infected six baboons and an equal

209

number of marmosets with SARS-CoV-2 in order to compare the progression of COVID-19 in

210

different NHP models.

211
212

Long-term study of SARS-CoV-2 infection in rhesus macaques, baboons and marmosets

demonstrates heterogeneity in progression to COVID-19

214

Results of the longitudinal study showed that the acute signs of SARS-CoV-2 infection and mild-

215

to-moderate COVID-19 disease in rhesus macaques markedly improved over time (Fig S7). In

216

general, no major differences were observed as a consequence of age, and subsequent data from

217

young and old animals are combined (N=12), unless specified. A small subset (3/12) of animals

218

exhibited elevated serum CRP past 3 dpi (Fig S7a), although metabolic signs of dysfunction likely

219

induced by infection (e.g. tCO2 elevation) continued for the duration of the study (Fig S7b). No

220

alterations were observed in the levels of serum albumin or hemoglobin during this timeframe

221

(not shown). There was a significant decline in RBCs (Fig S7c) at 3 and 6 dpi which normalized or

222

reverted by 9 dpi. The percentage of neutrophils in the peripheral blood remained unchanged

223

between 3-14 dpi (not shown). The significant decline in blood platelets and increase in the

224

percentage of monocytes observed at 3 dpi, were short-lived (Fig S7d, e). Despite these modest

225

changes, the majority of animals in both age groups exhibited weight loss throughout the study

226

duration (Fig S7f), although pyrexia was not observed (not shown).

227
228

Viral RNA was detected in BAL of 10/12 macaques at 3 dpi, but declined thereafter (Fig 4a).

229

Detection of viral RNA was equivalent between young (5/6) and old (5/6) macaques (Fig S8a).

230

Very low viral RNA copy numbers were detected in BAL at 9 dpi with only one young macaque

231

testing positive, and none by 12 dpi (Fig 4a). Viral RNA appeared to persist for much longer in NS

232

than BAL, including at study endpoint (Fig 4b). Viral RNA was detected from NS in 6/12 macaques

233

at 3 dpi and on average young macaques harbored more virus in their nasal cavity at 3 dpi relative

234

to old animals but the differences were not significant (Fig S8b). SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected

235

in 10/12 macaques (6 young, 4 old, respectively) at 9 dpi and 6/12 macaques at the end of the

236

study period (Fig S8b). These results suggest that the virus persists for at least two weeks in the

237

respiratory compartment of immunocompetent macaques that clinically recovered from COVID-

238

19. Viral RNA was detected from BS in 4/12 animals at 3 and 6 dpi, but not at later time points

239

(Fig S8c, d). No significant difference was detected between age groups. Viral RNA was also

RNA (2.5 logs) were detectable at the end of the study (14-17 days) when compared to viral RNA

242

detected at the end of the 3-day protocol (Fig 4c, Fig S9a). Viral RNA was detected in the lungs of

243

two-thirds (8/12) of all macaques and no effect of age was apparent. No viral RNA was detected

244

in any serum samples (Fig S9b) or in randomly selected urine samples (Fig S9c). The presence of

245

viral RNA in the lungs of macaques after two weeks following recovery from acute COVID-19

246

indicates that while macaques control SARS-CoV-2 infection, immune responses are not

247

sterilizing.

248
249

Gross examination of the lungs of most infected animals at necropsy (14 to 17 dpi) was

250

unremarkable (Fig S10a); however, red discoloration of the dorsal aspect of the lung lobes was

251

seen in four young and two aged animals (Fig S10b). Table S3 summarizes the histopathologic

252

findings in descending order of occurrence by anatomic location. The lungs were the most

253

affected organ (Fig 4d, e, Table S3). Multifocal minimal to mild interstitial mononuclear

254

inflammation was seen in 11/12 animals (Fig 4n, 0, Fig S10c), generally composed of macrophages

255

and lymphocytes that expanded the alveolar septa (Fig 4n, Fig S10d, e, f, g), with variable

256

neutrophil infiltrates (5/12, Fig S10e), fibrosis (5/12, Fig 4o, Fig S10f, g) or vasculitis (3/12, Fig

257

S10i). Alveolar epithelium often contained areas of type II pneumocyte hyperplasia (4/12, Fig

258

S10e) and bronchiolization (2/12, Fig S10h). Alveolar lumina contained increased alveolar

259

histiocytosis (9/12, Fig 4o, Fig S10d, e) occasionally admixed with neutrophils (5/12, Fig S10e).

260

Syncytial cells (Fig S10e, f) were observed most frequently in the alveolar lumen in all 12 animals.

Bronchitis was observed in 4/12, characterized by infiltrates of eosinophils within the bronchial

262

wall and epithelium (Fig S10j). Prominent perivascular lymphocytes (7/12, Fig S10k) and BALT

263

hyperplasia (5/12, Fig S10i) were frequently observed. The majority of the animals (11/12)

264

exhibited minimal to moderate lymphoplasmacytic and eosinophilic tracheitis.

265
266

Early detection of viral RNA in BAL was comparable between macaques and baboons (Fig 4a, f)

267

and NS (Fig 4b, g). A third of the baboons had detectable viral RNA in NS at 12 dpi (Fig 4g), and a

268

similar number of animals remained positive at 9 dpi in the BS (Fig S11a). The number of baboons

269

from which viral RNA could be detected in RS increased over time from 1/6 at 3 dpi to 3/6 at 6

270

dpi, 4/6 at 9 dpi and 3/6 at 12 dpi, underscoring long-term viral persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in

271

baboons relative to rhesus macaques (Fig S11b). Postmortem gross examination at 14 to 17 dpi

272

identified red discoloration of the lung lobes in all six baboons (Fig S11c, d). Table S4 summarizes

273

the histopathologic findings in descending order of occurrence by anatomic location. Like

274

macaques, the lungs were the most affected organ in the baboons (Fig 4h, i, Table S6, Fig S11).

275

Multifocal minimal to moderate interstitial mononuclear inflammation was seen in 6/6 animals

276

(Fig 4h, Fig S11f, g, h, i), generally composed of macrophages and lymphocytes that expanded

277

the alveolar septa, with variable neutrophil infiltrates (3/6, Fig S11f, g, j, k) or fibrosis (2/6, Fig

278

S11j, k). Alveolar epithelium often contained areas of type II pneumocyte hyperplasia (4/6, Fig 4i,

279

Fig S11i) and bronchiolization (1/6, Fig S11l). Alveolar lumina contained increased alveolar

280

histiocytosis (6/6, Fig 4h) occasionally admixed with neutrophils (3/6) (Fig S11f, g, h, i). Syncytial

281

cells were observed most frequently in the alveolar lumen in all 6 animals (Fig 4h, Fig S11m).

282

Bronchitis was observed in 6/6, characterized by infiltrates of eosinophils within the bronchial

wall and epithelium (Fig S11n). BALT hyperplasia (5/6, Fig S11k) was frequently observed. The

284

majority of the animals exhibited minimal to moderate lymphoplasmacytic and eosinophilic

285

tracheitis (5/6) and rhinitis (4/6).

286
287

SARS-CoV-2 infection was milder in marmosets. Less than 4 logs of viral RNA could be detected

288

in NS from infected marmosets, peaking at 3 dpi, and 1/6 animals was also positive at 6 dpi. No

289

viral RNA was detected at later time points (Fig 4j). No viral RNA was detected in BS (Fig 4k). A

290

subset of six marmosets was euthanized at 3 dpi (n=2), while others were necropsied at 14 dpi.

291

Approximately 2 logs of viral RNA could be detected in the lungs of marmosets at both time

292

points. Evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced pathology, including interstitial and alveolar

293

pneumonitis was observed in marmoset lungs as well (Fig 4m, n), although not as prevalent as in

294

macaques or baboons. Thus, our results show that three genera of NHPs develop different

295

degrees of COVID-19 following SARS-CoV-2 infection when evaluated side by side, with baboons

296

exhibiting moderate to severe pathology, macaques exhibiting moderate pathology and

297

marmosets exhibiting mild pathology. Viral RNA levels in BAL, NS and lungs are consistent with

298

the levels of pathology. While other results also suggest that marmosets are unaffected by SARS-

299

CoV-2 infection

300

that these NHPs do develop non-negligible, mild COVID-19-related pathology and some degree

301

of viral persistence.

We performed detailed imaging of macaques in the longitudinal study. Similar to the acute study,

306

infected macaques showed changes consistent with pneumonia (Table S5) with peak severity

307

seen between 3-6 dpi, followed by a decline by study end (Fig 5a, b, Table S5). Examples of the

308

development of extensive pneumonia by CXR can be seen in macaques at 6 dpi, relative to

309

baseline with subsequent resolution (Fig 5 c-e). Several animals exhibited multi-lobe alveolar

310

infiltrates and/or interstitial opacities at 6 dpi. In other animals, there were progressive,

311

moderate to severe interstitial and alveolar infiltrates at 6 dpi, which resolved by day 14.

312

Conversely, the radiographs of all procedure control animals (which underwent repeated BAL

313

procedures) exhibited normal a thorax cavity with minimal to no findings.

314
315

High resolution CT imaging of the lungs was performed prior to and following SARS-CoV-2

316

infection on six young and six old macaques. Pneumonia was present in all animals, post-

317

infection, but to a significantly higher degree in old macaques relative to young (Fig 5f, Fig S12a-

318

f, Table S6). At 6 dpi, severe patchy alveolar patterns were observed in some lobes, while other

319

lobes had milder, interstitial patterns, with moderate to severe ground glass opacities primarily

320

in the lungs of old macaques (Fig S12a-f). In all animals, resolution of many ground glass opacities

321

and nodular as well as multifocal lesions was observed at 12 dpi (Fig 5f, Fig S12a, b, d-f). At 12

322

dpi, all but one of the older macaques exhibited a normal or nearly normal thorax cavity, the

323

latter with minimal ground glass opacities in all lung lobes studied at this time. Findings in one

324

older macaque was considerably improved but retained patchy round glass opacities in all lobes

325

and alveolar patterns in some lobes at 12 dpi (Fig S12c). This animal had the highest overall score

326

by CT (Fig 5f) and CXRs (Fig 5 a-b). These results suggest that pneumonia in some older macaques

327

may persist longer than in younger animals. Similar to the acute study, hyperdensity analysis

revealed a significant, progressive increase in the volume of lung involved in pneumonia at 6 dpi,

329

which normalized by 12 dpi (Fig 5g-o).

331

SARS-CoV-2 infection in macaques results in a dynamic myeloid cell response in the lungs of

332

rhesus macaques

333

Cellular composition in BAL samples and peripheral blood11,12 at necropsy showed markedly

334

altered immune cell responses in the lung compartment following infection of macaques. In

335

healthy lungs, BAL is predominantly comprised of alveolar macrophages (AMs)13 but respiratory

336

tract infections result in the influx of other immune cells. SARS-CoV-2 infection moderately

337

increased the proportions of myeloid cells in the BAL 3 dpi, with most returning to normal by 9

338

dpi (Fig S13a). There was no effect of age (Fig S13b). The myeloid influx included cells phenotyped

339

as interstitial macrophages (IMs, Fig 6a, e), neutrophils (Fig 6c, g) and plasmacytoid dendritic cells

340

(pDCs, Fig 6d, h). In contrast, the levels of resident AMs in BAL declined significantly at 3 dpi (Fig

341

6b, f). The increase in IMs, neutrophils and pDCs at 3 dpi was highly correlated with the levels of

342

viral RNA (Fig 6i-j, Fig S13i), while AMs exhibited an opposite trend. The frequency of

343

conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) declined as pDCs increased in BAL (Fig S13c). An increase in

344

the levels of both classical (CD14+CD16-) (not shown) and intermediate/inflammatory

345

(CD14+CD16+) monocytes in BAL was also observed at 3 dpi (Fig S13d). The frequency of myeloid

346

subpopulations increased in BAL was generally reduced in blood (Fig S13e-h), with two

347

exceptions - pDCs and CD14+CD16+ monocytes, which were increased in the blood as well as BAL

348

(Fig S13g-h). Relative to AMs, IMs have a shorter half-life, exhibit continuous turnover, and may

349

help to maintain homeostasis and protect against continuous pathogen exposure from the

350

environment14. Increased recruitment of pDCs to the lungs suggests a potentially important

351

feature of protection from advanced COVID-19 disease in the rhesus macaque model since they

352

are a major source of anti-viral Type I interferons such as IFN-a, the levels of which were elevated

353

in the BAL within 1-3 dpi (Fig 3b).

354
355

Multi-label confocal imaging of lung tissues following Ki67 staining depicted that only few of the

356

virally-infected cells in the lung tissue actively proliferated (Fig 5k-p). Detailed analysis of the lung

357

tissue revealed that neutrophils (Fig 6k, l, Fig S14a, d), macrophages (Fig 6m, n, Fig S14b, h) and

358

pDCs (Fig 6o, p, Fig S14c, i) recruited to the lung compartment (Fig 6a-h) harbored high levels of

359

viral proteins (Fig 6k-p, Fig S14). Apart from these, many of the other cell-types contained viral

360

proteins, suggesting a capacity of the virus to infect many cell types and that intact virus may also

361

persist in the lungs. These novel data suggest that rapid influx of specialized subsets of myeloid

362

cells to the lung that are known to express Type I IFNs and other pro-inflammatory cytokines is a

363

key event in the control of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

364
365

Infection of macaques also resulted in a significant influx of T cells to the alveolar space by 3 dpi,

366

which normalized by 9 dpi (Fig 7a, b, g). After infection, CD4+ T cells expressed significantly lower

367

levels of antigen-experience/tissue residence (CD69; Fig 6c), Th1 (CXCR3; Fig 6d), memory (CCR7;

368

Fig 6f), and activation (HLA-DR) (Fig 6m) markers in BAL. In contrast, the levels of CD4+ T cells

369

expressing PD-1 (Fig 6e) and LAG-3 (Fig 6n) were significantly elevated, while those of CD4+ T cells

370

expressing CCR5 (Fig 6l) were unchanged. A similar effect was observed in CD8+ T cell subsets,

371

where the expression of CD69 (Fig 6h), CXCR3 (Fig 6i), and CCR7 (Fig 6k) was significantly reduced

372

in BAL following infection whereas expression of PD-1 (Fig 6j) and LAG-3 (Fig 6q) in the CD8+ T

373

cells was significantly increased. CCR5 (Fig 6o) and HLA-DR (Fig 6p) were unchanged. No

374

differences were observed in T cell responses in young relative to old animals. Taking data from

375

myeloid cells and lymphocytes together, we postulate that the rapid influx of myeloid cells

376

capable of producing high levels of Type I IFNs result in immune control of SARS-CoV-2 infection

377

in macaques, but that this control is not sterilizing. This allows for viral antigens to persist leading

378

T cell recruitment, but with a T cell profile associated with immune modulation and promotion

379

of antigen-mediated T cell anergy/exhaustion (PD-1, LAG3 expression)15.

380
381

To extrapolate from phenotype to function, we explored proliferation, immune mediator

382

production, and memory phenotypes. CD4+ and CD8+ T cells exhibiting proliferative (Fig 8a, g)

383

and memory markers (Fig 8b, h) were significantly increased in BAL after infection whereas CD4+

384

and CD8+ T cells expressing naïve (Fig 8c, i) and effector (Fig 8d, j) phenotypes were significantly

385

reduced. The percentage of CD4+ (Fig 8e) and CD8+ (Fig 8k) T cells expressing IL-2 was significantly

386

elevated in the BAL at 9 dpi. A similar effect was observed for Granzyme-B (GZMB) (Fig 8f, l) which

387

was sustained through 9 dpi. No significant effect of age was observed, although the expression

388

of IL-2 on T cells was higher for young compared old rhesus macaques. Frequencies of CD4+ and

389

CD8+ expressing interferon-g (IFNG) (Fig S15a, d) and IL-17 (Fig S15b, e) were elevated, but

390

unchanged for TNF-a (Fig S15c, f). Greater expression of IFNg was measured on CD4+ T cells

391

recruited to the BAL in younger animals, but the differences were not statistically significant.

392

These results suggest that robust cellular immune responses (both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells) are

393

generated in the lung compartment (BAL) as early as day 3 and maintained at 9 dpi in many

394

instances. Following ex vivo re-stimulation of T cells from BAL at 9 dpi with CoV-specific peptide

395

pools, CD4+ T cells expressing IL-2 (Fig 8m), GZMB (Fig 8n), IFN-g (Fig S15g), IL-17 (Fig S15h) and

396

TNF-a (Fig S15i) were not statistically elevated beyond baseline values. This was similar for CD8+

397

T cells expressing IL-2 (Fig 8o), GZMB (Fig 8p), IFN-g (Fig S15j), IL-17 (Fig S15k) and TNF-a (Fig

398

S15l). In combination with increased expression of the immune-regulatory markers PD-1 and

399

LAG-3, our results suggest that T cells recruited to the lung compartment following SARS-CoV-2

400

infection are capable of secreting cytokine but fail to generate robust antigen specific responses

401

highlighting the fact that persistent T cell stimulation by viral antigens may generate T cell anergy

402

relatively early in infection and this is promoted by our findings of viral persistence in the

403

respiratory tract.

404
405

Immunophenotyping results were confirmed by studying cytokine production in BAL and plasma

406

(Fig S16)16. Our results show that the levels of IFN-a (Fig S16a), IL-1Ra (Fig S16b), and IL-6 (Fig

407

S16d) were elevated in BAL following infection, but levels rapidly normalized after the 3 dpi peak.

408

Levels of IFN-a were also induced in plasma (Fig S16g), but not those of IL-1Ra (Fig S16h), and IL-

409

6 (Fig S16j) or other cytokines studied. Cytokines were not induced at baseline or in procedure

410

control animals. Overall, the longitudinal study results were consistent with the acute infection

411

study in the expression of Type I pro-inflammatory cytokines responsible for viral control (IFN-a)

412

and expression of IL-6, which may contribute to a cytokine storm and development of ARDS in a

413

subset of hosts during COVID-19.

415

Protein levels of ACE-2, one presumed receptor for SARS-CoV-2 in humans, were detected at

416

higher levels in the lungs and nasal epithelia of infected macaques than those in the lungs of

417

naive rhesus macaques (Fig 1j, k). Using RNAseq we also studied if expression of ACE-2 could be

418

detected in macaque lung tissues and elevated in in SARS-CoV-2 infected animals. This was

419

indeed the case (Fig S17a-d) in a statistically significant manner two weeks after infection despite

420

multiple hypothesis correction (Fig S17a, b). Interestingly, ACE-2 expression was significantly

421

higher in young compared to old macaques (Fig S17c, d). These results potentially explain the

422

higher levels of virus that we observed in several samples derived from young macaques in these

423

two cohorts (Fig S8). Expression of transcripts specific for other viral receptors/co-receptors e.g.,

424

Cathepsin-L, CD147 or TMPRSS2 was not significantly altered in the lung two weeks after

425

infection (Fig S17a).

426
427

Altogether, our results show that rhesus macaques, baboons and marmosets can all be infected

428

with SARS-CoV-2 but exhibit differential progression to COVID-19. While marmosets exhibit mild

429

infection, macaques are characterized by the presence of moderate progressive pneumonia that

430

is rapidly resolved. This is accompanied by a marked reduction in lung and nasal viral loads.

431

Baboons appear to have the most lung pathology, and the level of viral shedding and persistence

432

in extra-respiratory compartment is also greater in this model. Furthermore, we show the

433

importance of state-of-the-art, non-invasive imaging – cone beam CT scanning, and the

434

application of innovative algorithms to identify the extent of lung involved in pneumonia, in

435

developing models of COVID-19. This provided us with a quantifiable metric that lent itself to

436

accurately assessing the efficacy of vaccines or the impact of therapeutic interventions.

437
438

Our results also point out, for the first time, that SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with dynamic

439

influxes of specific subsets of myeloid cells to the lung, particularly IMs, neutrophils and pDCs,

440

and that viral proteins can be detected in these cells. These cellular influxes are likely due to a

441

strong viral-induced myelopoeisis. This may help explain both development of COVID-19

442

pneumonia and subsequent control via expression of a strong Type I IFN response and expression

443

of other pro-inflammatory cytokines. We speculate that these responses clear the majority of

444

virus, and, in doing so, lead to eventual resolution of pneumonia, while limiting a progressive

445

cytokine storm and ARDS in the majority of hosts. Macaques have served as excellent models of

446

infectious diseases and vaccine development efforts17-19, and this model permits lung imaging

447

and detailed immune evaluations. Given the ability to reproducibly measure viral loads in NS and

448

BAL, and quantify lung involvement by CT scans and hyperdensity analyses, we expect this model

449

to play a critical role in the preclinical testing of novel candidate vaccines against SARS-CoV-2

450

infection and/or COVID-19 disease in development. Experiments in rhesus macaques can also

451

evaluate safety and immunogenicity, including the important issue of antibody-mediated

452

immune enhancement. Since mild-to-moderate COVID-19 disease that follows SARS-CoV-2

453

infection in rhesus macaques is short-lived, it follows that vaccine safety and efficacy studies can

454

be evaluated in short term studies.

455
456

However, detection of both virus and its protein antigens over two weeks in macaques, baboons

457

and even marmosets, indicates viral persistence rather than sterilizing immunity. Support for this

458

comes from the finding of PD-1 and LAG-3 expression by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the lung and

459

lack of induction of antigen-specific immune effector cytokine production by these cells.

460

Characterization of these responses is particularly important considering that T cell responses,

461

particularly T helper responses, play key roles in shaping the nature of downstream B cell

462

responses and production of antibodies. It is likely that in immunocompromised patients,

463

persistent presence of SARS-CoV-2 could lead to exacerbated disease. Since COVID-19 has

464

disproportionately affected the aging human population, we included age as an independent

465

variable in our studies. Although there were several smaller changes observed in older animals,

466

old and young animals both resolved infection. While it is possible that NHPs do not completely

467

model all aspects of COVID-19 in humans, these findings suggest that underlying conditions which

468

impact immunity such as defined and undefined co-morbidities, rather than aging per se, may be

469

responsible for the greater morbidity and mortality observed due to COVID-19 in the aged human

470

population (and a subset of younger individuals). Baboons developed more extensive disease and

471

pathology with more widespread and severe inflammatory lesions compared to rhesus

472

macaques. Baboons are also a preferred model of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases

including diabetes

disease, and aging.

Indian-origin rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta), and six African-origin baboons (Papio

488

hamadryas) all from SNPRC breeding colonies, were exposed via multiple routes (ocular, 100 µL;

489

490

- using a Teleflex Laryngo-Tracheal Mucosal Atomization Device) of inoculation to 500 µL of an

491

undiluted stock of SARS-CoV-2, which had a titer of 2.1E+06 pfu/mL, resulting in the

492

administration of 1.05x106 pfu SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 generated from isolate USA-WA1/2020

493

was used for animal exposures. A fourth cell-culture passage (P4) of SARS-CoV-2 was obtained

494

from Biodefense and Emerging Infections Research Resources Repository (BEI Resources, catalog

495

number NR-52281, GenBank accession number MN985325.1) and propagated at Texas Biomed.

496

The stock virus was passaged for a fifth time in Vero E6 cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI)

497

of approximately 0.001. This master stock was used to generate a sixth cell culture passage

498

exposure stock by infecting VeroE6 cells at a MOI of 0.02. The resulting stock had a titer of 2.10

499

x 106 PFU/mL and was attributed the Lot No. 20200320. The exposure stock has been confirmed

500

to be SARS-CoV-2 by deep sequencing and was identical to published sequence (MN985325).

504

oral and 100µL IT) of the same stock. The total target dose presented to marmosets was 8.82E+05

505

pfu/mL. Four macaques, baboons and marmosets each were sham-infected with DMEM-10

506

media (the storage vehicle of the virus), to be used as procedural controls. Infected animals were

507

euthanized for tissue collection at necropsy, and control animals were returned to the colony.

508

Macaques were enrolled from a specific pathogen-free colony maintained at the SNPRC and were

509

tested free from SPF-4 (simian retrovirus D, SIV, STLV-1 and herpes B virus). All animals including

510

the baboons and the marmosets were also free of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Animals were

511

monitored regularly by a board-certified veterinary clinician for rectal body temperature, weight

512

and physical examination. Collection of blood, BAL, nasal swab, and urine, under tiletamine-

513

zolazepam (Telazol) anesthesia was performed as described (Table S1), except that BAL was not

514

performed in marmosets. Four macaques were sampled daily until euthanized at 3dpi. All other

515

macaques and all the baboons were sampled at 0, 3, 6, 9, 12 dpi and at euthanasia (BAL

516

performed weekly). Blood was collected for complete blood cell analysis and specialized serum

517

chemistries. Animals were observed daily to record alert clinical measurements. Nasal

518

(longitudinal) or nasopharyngeal (acute) swabs and BALs were obtained to measure viral loads in

519

a longitudinal manner, as described earlier

520

visualized and a sterile feeding tube inserted into the trachea and advanced until met with

521

resistance. Up to 80ml of warm sterile saline was instilled, divided into multiple aliquots. Fluid

522

was aspirated and collected for analysis.

523

Chest X-Rays. Clinical radiographic evaluation was performed as following: The lungs of all

525

view thoracic radiographs (ventrodorsal, right and left lateral) were performed at all sampling

526

time points. High-resolution computed tomography (CT) was performed daily through 3 dpi in 4

527

infected macaques and on 6 and 12 dpi in 3 young and 3 old macaques as described in the next

528

section. Images were evaluated by a board-certified veterinary radiologist and scored as normal,

529

mild moderate or severe disease. The changes were characterized as to location (lung lobe) and

530

distribution (perivascular/peribronchial, hilar, peripheral, diffuse, multifocal/patchy).

531

CT Imaging and quantitative analysis of lung pathology. The animals were anesthetized using

532

Telazol (2-6mg/kg) and maintained by inhaled isoflurane delivered through Hallowell 2002

533

ventilator anesthesia system (Hallowell, Pittsfield, MA). Animals were intubated to perform end-

534

inspiratory breath-hold using a remote breath-hold switch. Lung field CT images were acquired

535

using Multiscan LFER150 PET/CT (MEDISO Inc., Budapest, Hungary) scanner. Image analysis was

536

performed using 3D ROI tools available in Vivoquant (Invicro, Boston, MA). Percent change in

537

lung hyperdensity was calculated to quantify lung pathology (1, 2). The lung volume involved in

538

pneumonia, was quantified as follows: briefly, lung segmentation was performed using a

539

connected thresholding feature, to identify lung ROI by classifying all the input voxels of scan in

540

the range of -850 HU to -500 HU. Smoothing filters were used to reassign every ROI voxel value

541

to the mode of the surrounding region with defined voxel radius and iterations to reconstruct

542

the Lung ROI. Thereafter, global thresholding was applied to classify the voxels within Lung ROI

543

in the range of -490 HU to +500 HU to obtain Lung hyperdensity ROI. The resultant ROIs were

544

then rendered in the maximum intensity projection view using the VTK feature.

Viral RNA determination. Viral RNA from plasma/sera, BAL, urine, saliva, and swabs

547

(nasal/nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal, rectal) and lung homogenates was determined by RT-

548

qPCR and viral RNA isolation as previously described for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV (12, 27, 28).

549

RNA extraction from fluids was performed using the EpMotion M5073c Liquid Handler

550

(Eppendorf) and the NucleoMag Pathogen kit (Macherey-Nagel). 100 µL of test sample were

551

mixed with 150 µL of 1X DPBS (Gibco) and 750 µL TRIzol LS. Inactivation controls were prepared

552

with each batch of samples to ensure no cross contamination occurred during inactivation.

553

Samples were thawed at room temperature and then, for serum, swabs and urine samples 10µg

554

yeast tRNA was added, along with 1 x 103 pfu of MS2 phage (Escherichia coli bacteriophage MS2,

555

ATCC). DNA LoBind Tubes (Eppendorf) were prepared with 20 µL of NucleoMag B-Beads

556

(NucleoMag Pathogen kit, Macherey-Nagel) and 975 µL of Buffer NPB2 (NucleoMag Pathogen kit,

557

Macherey-Nagel). After centrifugation, the upper aqueous phase of each sample was transferred

558

to the corresponding new tube containing NucleoMag B-Beads and Buffer NPB2. The samples

559

were mixed using HulaMixer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) rotating for 10 min at room

560

temperature. Samples were then transferred to the sample rack on EpMotion M5073c Liquid

561

Handler (Eppendorf) for further processing according to NucleoMag Pathogen kit instructions.

Figure S17. SARS-CoV-2 infection induces ACE-2 expression. RNAseq was performed on total

1362

RNA isolated from the lungs of naïve (n=3) and SARS-CoV-2 infected (14-17dpi) rhesus macaques

1363

(n=8, 3 young and 5 old macaques) as described earlier 16. Results indicate that the expression of

1364

ACE2, which is lower in naïve animals (denoted by red color in the heat map) (a), was induced

1365

following SARS-CoV-2 infection (denoted by blue color in the heat map) (a). Relative expression

1366

level of ACE-2 was significantly higher than in naïve tissues (b). Higher expression of ACE-2 was

1367

observed in lung tissues obtained at necropsy from young relative to old macaques (c, d), such

1368

that the difference between naïve animals and young SARS-CoV-2 infected animals in ACE-2

1369

expression levels was statistically significant by itself. All p-values shown on expression swarm
