Abstract

23

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic of 2020 has mobilised scientists around the globe to research all

24

aspects of the coronavirus virus and its infection. For fruitful and rapid investigation of viral

25

pathomechanisms, a collaborative and interdisciplinary approach is required. Therefore, we

26

have developed ViralLink: a systems biology workflow which reconstructs and analyses

27

networks representing the effect of viruses on intracellular signalling. These networks trace

28

the flow of signal from intracellular viral proteins through their human binding proteins and

29

downstream signalling pathways, ending with transcription factors regulating genes

30

differentially expressed upon viral exposure. In this way, the workflow provides a mechanistic

31

insight from previously identified knowledge of virally infected cells. By default, the workflow

32

is set up to analyse the intracellular effects of SARS-CoV-2, requiring only transcriptomics

33

counts data as input from the user: thus, encouraging and enabling rapid multidisciplinary

34

research. However, the wide-ranging applicability and modularity of the workflow facilitates

35

customisation of viral context, a priori interactions and analysis methods. Through a case

36

study of SARS-CoV-2 infected bronchial/tracheal epithelial cells, we evidence the functionality

37

of the workflow and its ability to identify key pathways and proteins in the cellular response to

38

infection. The application of ViralLink to different viral infections in a cell-type specific manner

39

using different available transcriptomics datasets will uncover key mechanisms in viral

40

pathogenesis.

Author summary

44

Collaborative and multidisciplinary science provides increased value for experimental datasets

45

and speeds the process of discovery. Such ways of working are especially important at

46

present due to the urgency of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Here, we present a systems biology

47

workflow which models the effect of viral proteins on the infected host cell, to aid collaborative

48

and multidisciplinary research. Through integration of gene expression datasets with context-

49

specific and context-agnostic molecular interaction datasets, the workflow can be easily

50

applied to different datasets as they are made available. Application to diverse SARS-CoV-2

51

datasets will increase our understanding of the mechanistic details of the infection at a cell

52

type specific level, aid drug target discovery and help explain the variety of clinical

53

manifestations of the infection.

Introduction

55

By mid-May 2020 at least 4000 scientific preprints and publications were released relating to

56

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the disease it causes

57

(COVID-19) (Kwon 2020). This fast uptake in research efforts is vital to decrease the health

58

and economic impacts of this new pandemic. However, many questions remain unanswered

59

regarding the molecular processes driving host responses to this coronavirus. One key

60

challenge to utilisation of new findings is that published datasets are mostly unlinked to each

61

other (due to parallel efforts by multiple research groups) and not always connected to

62

community standard resources. An integrated and reusable method to interactively capture

63

new data and connect it to existing data sources is needed. Such a comprehensive approach

64

that can be run regularly when relevant new data is available, will increase and update our

65

understanding of the mechanistic details of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further, it will aid drug

66

target discovery by enabling identification of high confidence mediators through which the

67

virus is affecting host cells (Barabási et al. 2011). Studying the effect of the virus at molecular

68

level may explain the variety of clinical manifestations of the infection and the differences in

69

susceptibility between different populations, and together with soon available human

70

genomics data, could be used for identifying risk factors.

71
72

Upon entry of a virus into a human cell via surface receptors, viral RNA is released and

73

translated into proteins (Oberfeld et al. 2020). In addition to their role in direct viral replication,

74

these proteins are able to bind to human proteins creating a host-virus interface (Gordon et

75

al. 2020). This interaction can lead to downstream signalling changes in the host cell, either

76

as a result of viral hijacking or through a defined viral immune response by the host cell (Alto

77

and Orth 2012). Ultimately, this signal flow results in intracellular gene transcription changes,

78

cell-cell signalling and systemic host responses which drive the tug-of-war between the host

79

and the virus (Fung et al. 2020). In order to understand and control this conflict, it is necessary

80

to study each of these levels of host response in detail, including the intracellular response of

81

the primarily infected cell.

82
83

Currently available data relating to intracellular SARS-CoV-2 infection includes human binding

84

partners of viral proteins (Gordon et al. 2020) and transcriptomics datasets from infected cell

85

lines/organoids (Blanco-Melo et al. 2020; Lamers et al. 2020), infected patients (Liao et al.

86

2020; Huang et al. 2020) and other infected animals (Pfaender et al. 2020; Blanco-Melo et al.

87

2020). Interdisciplinary and collaborative science can maximise the value of each of these

88

datasets through data integration and comparison combined with application of different

89

computational analysis approaches. One such computational analysis method is the utilisation

90

of network approaches to model molecular interactions between the virus and human proteins

91

as well as within and between human cells (Guven-Maiorov et al. 2017). Network approaches

92

have already been applied to study SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and to predict drug

93

repurposing candidates and master regulators based on proteins in proximity to human

94

binding proteins (which physically associate with SARS-CoV-2 proteins) (Gysi et al. 2020;

95

Messina et al. 2020; Zhou et al. 2020; Guzzi et al. 2020).

96
97

Here we present a systems biology workflow, to study the effect of viral infections on host

98

cells. ViralLink reconstructs and analyses a causal molecular interaction network whose signal

99

starts with the binding of an intracellular viral protein to a human protein, travels via multiple

100

signalling pathways, and ends at the transcriptional regulation of altered genes. Subsequently,

101

the workflow investigates the causal network using betweenness centrality measures, cluster

102

analysis, functional overrepresentation analysis and network visualisation. Using currently

103

available datasets from SARS-CoV-2 infected bronchial epithelial cells we demonstrate that

104

this workflow can identify biologically relevant signalling pathways and predict key proteins for

105

potential drug interventions. As the workflow is built in a modular, standardised and updateable

106

fashion, it can be used easily in the future to analyse new SARS-CoV-2 related datasets (from

107

human biopsy data, multiple tissues, etc.).

108

Methods

109

ViralLink workflow overview

110

The ViralLink workflow investigates the effect of viral infection within cells by generating and

111

analysing context-specific networks of intracellular signalling and regulatory molecular

112

interactions. These networks link the intracellular binding of viral and human proteins to the

113

transcriptional response of the infected cell (Figure 1). The context-specificity of the analysis

114

is obtained through the choice of input transcriptomics datasets - it could refer to strain of virus,

115

type of infected cell, severity of infection, age of host or any other context of interest. By

116

default, the workflow is set up to analyse the intracellular effects of SARS-CoV-2, requiring

117

only transcriptomics counts data as input and thus encouraging and enabling rapid

118

multidisciplinary research. However, the wide-ranging applicability and modularity of the

119

workflow facilitates customisation of viral context, a priori interactions and analysis methods.

120

ViralLink contains three primary stages: 1) collection and input of data; 2) reconstruction of

121

the network; and 3) investigation of results using functional analysis, clustering, centrality

122

measures and visualisation.

125

Collection and input of data

126

Reconstruction of causal networks using ViralLink requires four separate input datasets

127

(Figure 1): viral protein-human binding protein interactions, a priori human protein-protein

128

interactions (PPIs), a priori human transcription factor (TF) - target gene (TG) interactions and

129

an unnormalised counts matrix from a gene expression experiment. By default, all data except

130

the transcriptomics counts are provided automatically. However alternative input files can be

131

provided if desired.

132
133

The default workflow uses SARS-CoV-2 protein-human binding protein interactions obtained

134

from an affinity-purification mass spectrometry study (Gordon et al. 2020) via Intact

135

(Hermjakob et al. 2004; Orchard et al. 2014). This data was reformatted to contain one row

136

per molecular interaction with 2 columns of UniProt IDs: SARS-CoV-2 proteins and human

137

binding proteins. Alternative viral-human PPIs can be provided using the same data format.

138

The workflow assumes all viral-human interactions have an inhibiting action on the human

139

protein, unless a third column named “sign” is present in the input file containing “+” for

140

activatory and “-” for inhibitory interactions. In addition, data is provided with the workflow

141

containing the gene names corresponding to each of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins, to enable

142

easy interpretation of the reconstructed networks.

143
144

For a priori human interactions, the workflow obtains and uses integrated collections of PPI

145

and TF-TG interactions from OmniPath and DoRothEA, respectively (Türei et al. 2016; Garcia-

146

Alonso et al. 2019). These interactions are obtained using the ‘OmniPathR’ R package (Türei

147

et al. 2016; R Core Team 2013) to download and filter signed and directed interactions. For

148

DoRothEA, only high and medium confidence level interactions are used (confidence scores

149

A-C). In contrast to importing static input files, this script enables the use of up to date

150

interaction data. Alternative interaction data can be used with the workflow provided it has the

151

same format: specifically, it must contain source and target uniprot IDs in the columns ‘to’ and

152

‘from’ and if the transcriptomics data uses gene symbols, the interaction data must additionally

153

contain gene symbols in the columns ‘source_genesymbol’ and ‘target_genesymbol’.

154

Furthermore, the interactions must be directed and signed with the sign of the interaction given

155

in the column ‘consensus_stimulation’ where the value ‘1’ represents a stimulation and

156

anything else represents an inhibition.

157
158

The aforementioned a priori interactions are contextualised using transcriptomics data from

159

any study of interest which compares viral infected to uninfected human cells or tissues.

160

Correspondingly, the workflow requires unnormalised counts data from a transcriptomics

161

experiment (containing Uniprot or gene symbols as IDs) and a corresponding mapping table

5

162

which lists the sample IDs (from the headers of the counts table) in the ‘sample_name’ column

163

and the ‘test’ or ‘control’ status of the sample in the ‘condition’ column. This mapping table is

164

used to carry out differential expression of a test condition (e.g. infected) compared to a control

165

condition (e.g. uninfected). An example expression dataset and mapping table are provided

166

with the workflow.

167
168

To process the transcriptomics data, the workflow uses ‘DESeq2’ in R to normalise the counts

169

and to carry out differential expression analysis (Love et al. 2014). Any genes passing the log2

170

fold change and adjusted p value cutoffs, based on the provided parameters (default 1 and

171

0.05, respectively), are classed as differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Following removal

172

of all genes with count = 0, normalised log2 counts across all samples are fitted to a gaussian

173

kernel (Beal 2017). All genes with expression values above mean minus three standard

174

deviations are considered as expressed genes. Subsequently, context-specific human PPI

175

and TF-TG interactions are generated by filtering only interactions where both interacting

176

molecules are expressed.

177
178

File paths to all input datasets and associated parameters (such as desired log2 fold change

179

cut off) are specified in the parameters text file which is read in by the workflow.

180

Network reconstruction

181

The reconstructed causal network contains three layers of interactions, which are obtained,

182

by default, from the three a priori interaction resources:

183

●

184
185

in the IntAct database (Hermjakob et al. 2004; Orchard et al. 2014)
●

186
187

Viral proteins interacting with human binding partners: from the SARS-CoV-2 collection
Intermediary signalling protein interactions: from protein-protein interactions (PPIs) of
the OmniPath collection (Türei et al. 2016)

●

Transcription factors (TFs) regulating differentially expressed genes: from a

188

transcriptomics dataset of interest and the DoRothEA collection (Garcia-Alonso et al.

189

2019)

190
191

A list of all TFs targeting the differentially expressed genes are obtained from the context-

192

specific TF-TG interactions. The human binding proteins of viral proteins are connected to the

193

listed TFs through the context-specific human PPIs using a network diffusion approach called

194

Tied Diffusion Through Interacting Events (TieDIE) (Paull et al. 2013). As inputs for the TieDIE

195

tool, the following information is used: (1) The signed, directed and expression based filtered

196

PPIs is used as the input network. (2) Human proteins which are interacting partners of the

197

viral proteins are used as the start nodes. The number of viral proteins bound to each of the

6

made available under aCC-BY 4.0 International license.

198

human proteins are assigned as the weights of the start nodes. (3) The TFs of the DEGs in

199

the dataset are used as the stop nodes. The weights for each of the TFs in the set of stop

200

nodes were calculated using the following formula (Equation 1) which considers both the log2

201

fold change of the DEGs as well as the sign (i.e stimulatory or inhibitory) of the relationship

202

between the TF and the DEG.

203

204

Equation 1

205
206
207

After running TieDIE, a custom R script is used to collate all the data into a final viral-initiated

208

intracellular signalling network (causal network), outputting an edge table representation of

209

the network, with a node table containing additional node annotations. Starting with the

210

interactions output from TieDIE, viral protein-human binding protein interactions are added for

211

each of the present human binding proteins. Similarly, TF-TG interactions (where the TG is a

212

DEG) are added for each of the present TFs, creating a full network with three interaction

213

types: SARS-CoV-2 protein-human binding protein, PPI and TF-DEG. All nodes of the network

214

are added to a node table with annotations including heat values (output from TieDIE), Entrez

215

IDs (obtained in R using the ‘org.Hs.eg.db’ package), gene symbols (obtained from UniProt

216

(UniProt Consortium 2019)) and log2 fold change values from the differential expression

217

analysis.

218

Network investigation

219

Following reconstruction of the causal network, ViralLink provides functionality to investigate

220

the results using functional analysis, clustering, centrality measures and visualisation.

221

Centrality measures

222

To identify key molecules in the reconstructed network ViralLink uses a betweenness centrality

223

measure - calculating the global importance of a node (in this case a protein) based on the

224

number of shortest paths which pass through them when connecting all node pairs in the

225

network (Koschützki and Schreiber 2008). Nodes with high betweenness centrality play a key

226

role in transduction of signals through the network, and here represent proteins with biological

227

importance in the cellular response to viral infection. Betweenness centrality is calculated for

228

each node in the causal network using the R package ‘igraph’ and output as an annotation in

7

229

the node table (Csárdi and Nepusz 2006). Alternative centrality measures are available using

230

the ‘igraph’ package and can be integrated into the workflow by the user if required.

231

Cluster analysis

232

Clustering algorithms are commonly used in network biology to investigate the complex

233

structure of molecular interaction networks by extracting groups of densely connected

234

molecules (Bader and Hogue 2003; Brohée et al. 2008). Depending on the number of

235

molecules included, a cluster can represent a molecular complex or a group of molecules

236

which function closely with each other. Cluster analysis can identify subsets of a large network

237

with specific functions and indicate molecules that may have functional redundancy with each

238

other - potentially having implications for drug targeting. ViralLink employs the MCODE

239

clustering method to identify groups of densely connected nodes in PPI networks (Bader and

240

Hogue 2003). To carry out this analysis, ViralLink requires a local version of the Cytoscape

241

software to be open (Shannon et al. 2003; Su et al. 2014), which is controlled programmatically

242

using the R package ‘RCy3’ with the Cytoscape ‘MCODE’ app (v1.6.1) (Gustavsen et al.

243

2019). MCODE is run using default parameters: degree cut off =2, haircut=TRUE, node score

244

cut off=0.2, k-core=2, max depth=100. This analysis outputs the data as node annotations in

245

the node table, which are used for the functional analysis and visualisation steps of the

246

workflow. If Cytoscape is not running, this step of the workflow will be skipped.

247

Functional analysis

248

To further investigate important cellular functions and signalling pathways directly affected by

249

the virus of interest, ViralLink carries out functional overrepresentation analysis on different

250

parts of the causal network:

251

1. The DEGs of the network

252

2. The upstream human proteins (including human binding proteins, intermediary

253
254

signalling proteins and TFs)
3. Identified clusters (only those with ≥ 15 nodes are investigated)

255
256

Functional overrepresentation analysis is carried out in R using packages ‘ClusterProfiler’ (for

257

Gene Ontology annotations (Ashburner et al. 2000)) and ‘ReactomePA’ (for Reactome

258

annotations (Yu et al. 2012; Yu and He 2016; Fabregat et al. 2018). For analysis of the

259

upstream human signalling proteins and analysis of clusters, all proteins in the context-specific

260

human PPI interactions are used as the background. For analysis of the DEGs, all target

261

genes in the context-specific human TF-TG interactions are used as the background. For

262

Gene Ontology (Biological Process) analysis (except when running the compareCluster

263

command), the ‘simplify’ command is used (cutoff=0.1, select_fun=min) to remove redundant

264

functions. All functions with q val ≤ 0.05 are considered significantly overrepresented.

265
266

An additional R script is provided alongside the workflow which creates subnetworks of the

267

causal network based on functions of interest. These function-specific subnetworks highlight

268

how specific signalling pathways in the infected cell reach (and subsequently affect) specific

269

functions of the DEGs. For example, the subnetwork could be created to show how viral

270

proteins can affect different host toll-like receptor pathways, and how these pathways can

271

ultimately affect DEGs associated with interleukins. In this network the DEG nodes would be

272

replaced with nodes representing the interleukin functions (which must be overrepresented

273

based on the functional analysis). This script requires the output files from the functional

274

analysis, the node and edge tables of the causal network and a file of all Uniprot IDs

275

associated with all Reactome functions (which is provided with ViralLink, following download

276

from the Reactome website in April 2020). In addition, the script requires a list of

277

overrepresented DEG functions (Reactome) and a list of upstream signalling functions

278

(Reactome) to visualise. The script outputs an edge table, a node table and a Cytoscape file

279

(if Cytoscape is open locally at the time of running the script).

280

Visualisation

281

Data visualisation is often an important part of biological network interpretation, providing new

282

insights into the data and visually conveying analysis results (Pavlopoulos et al. 2008). As

283

such, ViralLink has the capability to import reconstructed networks into the open-source

284

Cytoscape network visualisation software (Shannon et al. 2003; Su et al. 2014). This

285

functionality requires that the user has Cytoscape installed and open locally. Specifically, the

286

workflow employs the ‘RCy3’ R package to interact with Cytoscape programmatically,

287

importing the node and edge tables to create network visualisations and saving the data as a

288

‘.cys’ file. The causal network, the network clusters (where containing ≥ 15 nodes) and the

289

function-specific networks are visualised in this way. If calculated previously, the causal

290

network nodes are coloured based on their betweenness centrality, however further style and

291

layout customisation must be carried out by the user directly based on the data.

292

Implementation

293

The workflow consists of modular R and Python scripts which can be run separately or through

294

the provided Python wrapper script. If running for the study of SARS-CoV-2, the only required

295

input files are related to the transcriptomics data of interest: a raw counts table (using gene

296

symbols or UniProt protein IDs) and a two-column metadata table specifying test and control

297

sample IDs. One further script is provided to generate function-specific networks. This script

is not included in the wrapper because it requires the user to specify functions of interest from

299

the output of the functional analysis. To run everything, it is necessary that the user has R,

300

Python3 and Cytoscape installed. The only file the user needs to edit is the parameters text

301

file where input file paths and parameters are specified. All scripts, default input files and

Use case

305

To demonstrate the application of this workflow for the study of SARS-CoV-2, we applied it to

306

a published transcriptomics dataset. We downloaded raw counts tables from a transcriptomics

307

study of SARS-CoV-2 infected (MOI 2, 24 hour incubation) NHBE cells (Normal Human

308

Bronchial/tracheal Epithelial cell line) with uninfected controls (Blanco-Melo et al. 2020) via

309

Gene Expression Omnibus (accession GSE147507) (Edgar et al. 2002; Barrett et al. 2013).

310

OmniPath and DoRothEA (v2, A-C) were downloaded on 15/04/2020. Any genes with log2

311

fold change ≥ |0.5| and adjusted p value ≤ 0.05 were classed as differentially expressed. All

312

networks were visualised in Cytoscape (v3.7.2).

313

Results

314

Use case: SARS-CoV-2 infection of lung cells

315

To demonstrate the application of this workflow for the study of SARS-CoV-2, we created

316

intracellular signalling networks of NHBE cells (from Normal Human Bronchial/tracheal

317

Epithelial cell lines) upon infection with SARS-CoV-2 based on data published by Blanco Melo

318

et al. (Blanco-Melo et al. 2020) and viral-human binding protein interactions published by

319

Gordon et al. (Gordon et al. 2020). The resulting causal network contains 804 nodes

320

(molecules) and 5423 interactions (Figure 2A, Supplementary Tables 1-2, Supplementary File

321

1). The 10 most central proteins of the reconstructed causal network (based on betweenness

322

centrality) are involved in a wide range of cellular functions (Figure 2B). Taken together these

323

proteins highlight the propensity for SARS-CoV-2 to affect cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell

324

adhesion, exocytosis and proinflammatory immune responses. These functions are influenced

325

through multiple cellular pathways, most notably MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT signalling

326

pathways.

330
331

Functional overrepresentation analysis of the causal network identified an enrichment of

332

interleukin and interferon related functions among the network DEGs, in line with previously

333

published findings (Supplementary Figure 1, Supplementary File 2) (Zhang et al. 2020; Chua

334

et al. 2020; Huang et al. 2020). Overrepresented functions and pathways of the upstream

335

signalling proteins (human binding proteins, intermediary signalling proteins and TFs) included

336

innate immunity-related functions, platelet signaling, PI3K/AKT signalling, MAPK activation,

337

estrogen receptor-mediated signalling, senescence and a number of growth factor receptor-

338

associated functions (such as VEGF signalling, receptor tyrosine kinases, stem cell growth

339

factor signalling (SCF-KIT) and neurotrophin receptor signaling). Therefore, we show that this

340

analysis highlights additional pathways through which SARS-CoV-2 could be affecting the lung

341

epithelial cells, which cannot be identified by looking at the transcriptomic results in isolation.

342
343

Based on functional overrepresentation analysis, we created a function-specific network by

344

sub setting the causal network. This visualisation was used to further explore the mechanisms

345

of how specific signalling pathways are affecting the DEGs (Supplementary Figure 2A,

346

Supplementary File 3). Specifically, we generated an innate-immunity associated subnetwork

347

containing all upstream human signalling proteins associated with Reactome functions

348

cytokine signalling in immune system, signaling by interleukins and MyD88-independent TLR4

349

cascade and all overrepresented functions of the DEGs (in place of the DEG nodes). These

350

pathways contain 9/10 of the top betweenness centrality nodes (all except RHOA), evidencing

351

the centrality and importance of the innate immune response to viral infection. Inspecting the

352

TF layer of this immune subnetwork, we find a number of key TFs including STAT proteins (3

353

and 4), IRF proteins (1 and 5) and NFKB-related proteins (NFKB1, NFKBIA).

354
355

Finally, we evidenced the application of MCODE clustering analysis to using the reconstructed

356

SARS-CoV-2-infected NHBE cell causal network. We identified four clusters containing 15 or

357

more nodes, making up 19% of the network (154/804) (Supplementary Figure 2B,

358

Supplementary Table 2, Supplementary File 1). Assuringly, 9/10 of the top betweenness

359

centrality nodes were included in these four clusters, further confirming the high connectivity

360

and importance of these nodes in the causal network. Functional overrepresentation analysis

361

of the cluster nodes highlighted a functional similarity between all four of the clusters

362

(Supplementary Figure C-D, Supplementary File 2). Likely this is due to the high number of

363

inter-cluster molecular interactions and because of the functional similarities between the top

364

central nodes.

365
366

Collectively, we show that our systems biology workflow, ViralLink, reconstructs a functionally

367

relevant intracellular signalling network affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Investigation of the

371

Discussion

372

Infection by SARS-CoV-2 can cause a complex and systemic response by the human body.

373

As such, a better mechanistic understanding of the effects of SARS-CoV-2 will aid

374

identification of effective drug treatments and help to explain the differences in susceptibilities

375

across different populations (Kirby 2020). This understanding can be gained using cross-

376

disciplinary approaches which combine ‘omics data generation, computational

377

biology and validatory web lab experiments (Korcsmaros et al. 2017). Here we present a

378

computational workflow that can be used to model the cellular response to infection by

379

integrating knowledge of human binding proteins of viral proteins with the transcriptional

380

response of a cell/cell type. Whilst set up primarily to run analyses based on SARS-CoV-2,

381

ViralLink can be applied to any viral infection, provided data is available describing possible

382

interactions between the viral proteins and human proteins.

systems

383
384

ViralLink builds on our previously published resource MicrobioLink, which reconstructs

385

networks representing the effect of extracellular and intracellular microbial proteins on cellular

386

processes (Andrighetti et al. 2020). Differing from MicrobioLink, ViralLink inputs a

387

predetermined list of viral-host PPIs and focuses only on pathways ending in transcriptional

388

regulation: thereby reducing the complexity of the workflow (for accessibility and speed

389

purposes) and increasing its predictive confidence. Furthermore, ViralLink extends the

390

functionality of MicrobioLink with more advanced network analysis (functional enrichment,

391

clustering and centrality measures) and visualisation options.

392
393

By exploiting previously collated and comprehensive collections of molecular interactions

394

(Türei et al. 2016; Garcia-Alonso et al. 2019), ViralLink predicts how signal flows from the

395

initial interaction with a viral protein or protein fragment to the ultimate transcriptional changes

396

induced by the virus. Through mapping the direct intracellular effect of viral infection (using a

397

network approach), this workflow enables further investigation into specific signalling

398

pathways and transcription factors which play a key role in signal transduction. Signalling

399

pathways are primarily regulated through post-translational modifications and thus would not

400

be identified using transcriptomics datasets (Antebi et al. 2017). In addition, the resulting

401

intracellular networks allow identification of differentially regulated genes that are affected as

402

a direct result of viral recognition by protein-protein signalling pathways, rather than by

403

secondary signals such as elevated cytokine levels. This permits a more focused analysis of

404

possible drug targets and adds to the understanding of viral pathomechanisms. Functional

405

analysis and visualisation methods included in the workflow are vital for interpretation of the

406

generated intracellular networks, enabling detailed investigation of key proteins and signalling

407

pathways.

408
409

Due to the modularity of the workflow, it can be easily adjusted or extended - different diffusion

410

and propagation algorithms, such as HotNet2 (Leiserson et al. 2015; Cowen et al. 2017), could

411

be implemented as required. The implemented diffusion tool, TieDIE, adds mechanistic value

412

by accounting for local causality (e.g. sign) but, on the other hand, has a reduced possible set

413

of input a priori interactions. If desired, a diffusion tool which does not need signed a priori

414

interactions can be implemented to increase the input dataset size. Alternatively, a different

415

method, such as an integer linear programming approach which identifies paths based on an

416

optimisation problem (as implemented in CARNIVAL), could be used for network

417

reconstruction (Liu et al. 2019). In addition, integration of CARNIVAL could extend the

418

workflow to permit network reconstruction without supplying upstream perturbations (in this

419

case the viral-host protein interactions). Whilst not currently integrated due to data availability

420

issues, the addition of phosphoproteomics data to the pathway propagation methods could

421

improve the prediction of active pathways (Dugourd et al. 2020) Alternatively, methods to

422

predict protein activity based on transcriptional signatures, such as VIPER and PROGENy

423

(Alvarez et al. 2016; Schubert et al. 2018) could be added to the workflow in addition to

424

network diffusion methods to increase the confidence of pathway predictions. Finally,

425

extension of the network to include additional regulatory molecule types (e.g. miRNAs) or to

426

study non-human hosts, could uncover further mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 can affect

427

host cells.

428
429

Accessible through GitHub, the workflow requires R and Python3 to be installed (and

430

Cytoscape for clustering and visualisation), however only a limited programming ability is

431

required to run the code. All code is wrapped into a Python script with a separate file where

432

all input file paths and parameters are specified. At a minimum, only two user specified input

433

files are required: a raw counts table from a transcriptomics study (using gene symbols or

434

UniProt protein IDs) and a two-column metadata table specifying test and control sample IDs.

435

All other files are provided or acquired directly within the workflow - but can be changed by

436

the user if required. However, one limitation of the current workflow is that creation of

437

Cytoscape visualisations and clustering analysis require the user to install and open the

438

Cytoscape app. If this is not possible, for example because the scripts are not being run on a

439

machine with a graphical interface, these steps are skipped. Furthermore, only basic

440

visualisation is possible programmatically, due to challenges applying one visualisation

441

strategy to all possible output networks, especially with regard to the function-based networks.

442
443

In addition to accessibility through a default emphasis on SARS-CoV-2, a key strength of this

444

workflow is the ability to use different input datasets: including different a priori molecular

445

interactions, viral-human binding protein interactions and expressed/differentially expressed

446

gene lists. This allows extensive customisation and permits rapid implementation to the most

447

cutting-edge data soon after publication. Running the workflow across different

448

transcriptomics datasets will allow comparison of intracellular viral responses between

449

different cell types, different species and across different conditions (such as severe vs

450

asymptomatic infection). For example, application of the workflow to transcriptomics data from

451

specific immune cell-types, such as macrophages, will likely uncover different host affected

452

signalling pathways and key TFs based on the infected cell-type. This, in turn, could increase

453

our understanding of the role of different immune populations in fighting the infection. In

454

addition, the workflow can be run on data from other SARS-CoV-2 strains when and if they

455

emerge, thereby aiding comparisons of mechanisms of action between the strains.

456
457

To evidence the use of this workflow, we applied it to study the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection

458

in lung epithelial (NHBE) cells using transcriptomics data published by Blanco-Melo et al.

459

(Blanco-Melo et al. 2020). In the resulting causal network, DEGs directly affected by SARS-

460

CoV-2 initiated signalling are associated with functions that are known responses to SARS-

461

CoV-2 and other viral infections (Cao 2020; Shi et al. 2020; Sallard et al. 2020; Arvanitakis et

462

al. 1998). Upstream of these affected genes we identified a number of potentially important

463

signalling pathways relating to classical viral-immune responses, cell survival and cytoskeletal

464

rearrangements and cell adhesion. Previous investigation of the first SARS coronavirus

465

(SARS-CoV) identified an inhibition of cell proliferation and an increase in apoptosis regulated

466

to PI3K/AKT signalling (Mizutani et al. 2006; Tsoi et al. 2014). Our network of SARS-CoV-2-

467

initiated intracellular signalling suggests that the PI3K/AKT signalling and the AKT1 protein

468

itself are key mediators of SARS-CoV-2 initiated signal transduction and that apoptosis and

469

cell proliferation pathways are affected by SARS-CoV-2, thus highlighting similarities between

470

the two viruses. However, further experimentation and/or data curation is required to confirm

471

the direction of change of specific pathways (up- or downregulated) based on the results of

472

the presented workflow. Together our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 can affect NHBE cells

473

through a variety of signalling pathways which have been previously associated with similar

474

viruses, including growth factor signalling, MAPK/ERK signalling and PI3K/AKT signalling.

475

Furthermore, centrality measures and cluster analysis identified proteins which likely play a

476

key role in transduction of these signals, and could be good targets for drug treatments.

477
478

Several other network reconstruction methods exist which could be and have been applied to

479

study SARS-CoV-2 infections. For example Messina et al. and Gysi et al. (Messina et al. 2020;

480

Gysi et al. 2020) use diffusion algorithms and other similar methods to investigate proteins in

481

close proximity to human binding proteins based on PPI interactions and gene co-expression

482

networks. Our workflow builds on these approaches by linking viral proteins to DEGs. Through

483

this method we can observe which signalling pathways mediate the effect of the virus on

484

cellular transcription levels, creating a systems level view of cellular changes as a result of the

485

virus. Using the functional analysis methods and network visualisation capabilities of the

486

workflow, it is possible to predict which viral proteins and host signalling pathways can affect

487

specific cellular functions, enabling more focused identification of drug targets. In addition to

488

protein mediators, this method describes TFs which are involved in the cellular response and

489

identifies which DEGs can be affected as a direct result of viral proteins hijacking host

490

signalling and which are affected through a different mechanism. In addition to the presented

491

workflow, at least one other method has been used to reconstruct SARS-CoV-2-initiated

492

intracellular signalling networks (Ding et al. 2020) corroborating the benefits of such analysis

493

methods. Differing from the here presented approach, this work uses an extended version of

494

the Signaling Dynamic Regulatory Events Miner method to reconstruct the networks, resulting

495

in a more mathematically complex but computationally heavy analysis (Gitter et al. 2013).

496

Furthermore, the workflow by Ding et al. is a less reusable and accessible workflow because

497

it was designed for a specific analysis.

498
499

In conclusion, ViralLink is an easily accessible, reproducible and scalable systems biology

500

workflow to reconstruct and analyse molecular interaction networks representing the effect of

501

the viruses on intracellular signalling. We believe it is the first available integrative workflow

502

for analysing the downstream effects of viral proteins using viral host interactions and host

503

response data. Application of this workflow to study COVID-19 based on a wide variety of

504

conditions and datasets will uncover mechanistic details about SARS-CoV-2 infection of

505

different cell types, providing valuable predictions for wet-lab and clinical validation.
