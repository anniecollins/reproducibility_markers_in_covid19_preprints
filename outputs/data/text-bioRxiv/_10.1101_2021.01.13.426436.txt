Abstract
There is an urgent need to limit and stop the worldwide coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
pandemic via quick development of efficient and safe vaccination methods. Plasmid DNA
vaccines are one of the most remarkable vaccines that can be developed in a short term. pVAX1SARS-CoV2-co, which is a plasmid DNA vaccine, was designed to express severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein. The produced antibodies lead
to Immunoreactions against S protein, anti-receptor-binding-domain, and neutralizing action of
pVAX1-SARS-CoV2-co, as confirmed in a previous study. To promote the efficacy of the pVAX1SARS-CoV2-co vaccine, a pyro-drive jet injector (PJI) was employed. PJI is an injection device
that can adjust the injection pressure depending on various target tissues. Intradermally-adjusted
PJI demonstrated that pVAX1-SARS-CoV2-co vaccine injection caused a strong production of
anti-S protein antibodies, triggered immunoreactions and neutralizing actions against SARS-CoV2. Moreover, a high dose of pVAX1-SARS-CoV2-co intradermal injection via PJI did not cause
any serious disorders in the rat model. Finally, virus infection challenge in mice, confirmed that
intradermally immunized (via PJI) mice were potently protected from COVID-19 infection. Thus,
pVAX1-SARS-CoV2-co intradermal injection via PJI is a safe and promising vaccination method
to overcome the COVID-19 pandemic.

Introduction
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic accelerated the development of a safe and
effective vaccine candidate against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARSCoV-2). At least 52 vaccine candidates have been tested in clinical studies, and several types of
vaccine platforms were used, such as protein subunit, replicating viral vector, non-replicating viral
vector, inactivated virus, RNA, DNA, live attenuated virus, and virus-like particles (VLP); the
number of each vaccine candidate was 16, 5, 9, 7, 6, 6,1, and 2, respectively. Furthermore, an
intramuscular injection was employed for 44 vaccine candidates and an intradermal injection
method was employed for three DNA vaccine candidates and other five vaccine candidates were
administrated subcutaneously, intranasally, or via oral route (Table 1)1. Plasmid DNA2 and
mRNA3 vaccines have been developed in addition to traditional vaccines because both can be
quickly produced via generic manufacturing processes and can be constructed directly from the
genetic sequence information. This means that the nucleotide-based vaccines are easy to adapt
to viral mutations2. Furthermore, mass production technology has been established for DNA
plasmids and new technologies are being developed for mRNA vaccines as well, such as mRNA
stabilizing technology3. Five mRNA vaccine candidates and four DNA vaccine candidates are
involved in developing a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 virus. In contrast, an effective method to
introduce these molecules, especially DNA plasmids, into cells should be established for effective
protein expression and antibody induction. To resolve this issue, we previously reported the
potential of the intradermal jet injection method for DNA vaccination via model DNA vaccination

using ovalbumin expression plasmid4. In addition, when developing a new DNA vaccine, it is
important to assess the health effect of new vaccine candidates in addition to efficacy evaluation.
Nucleic acid-based vaccines have a great advantage of being developed at an accelerated pace5.
In addition, DNA vaccines are thermo-stable, whereas RNA vaccines require a cold-chain
system, which can be an obstacle for the worldwide supply of anti-COVID-19 vaccines. Recently,
novel plasmid DNA vaccines (AG0302-COVID19) against SARS-CoV-2 virus have been
developed and are currently in phase I/II trials in Japan6. AG0302-COVID19 has an optimized S
protein sequence that accelerates S protein expression in human cells. The S protein expression
in AG0302-COVID-transfected cells was successfully confirmed. AG0302-COVID19 with alum
adjuvant was intramuscularly injected, which induced both humoral and cellular immune
responses in a preclinical study. Moreover, AG0302-COVID19-induced antibodies showed
neutralizing activity for SARSCoV-2 S protein binding. Results of the peptide array used to
analyze the antibody epitopes revealed that most AG0302-COVID19-induced antibodies
recognized S2 and receptor binding domain (RBD). The anti-COVID-19 DNA vaccine candidate
pVAX1-SARS-CoV2-co has the same nucleotide sequence as AG0302-COVID19. The pVAX1SARS-CoV2-co-triggered antibodies have also been confirmed to neutralize RBD recombinant
protein and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is a SARS-CoV-2 receptor.
We employed a novel pyro-drive jet injector (PJI) was to enhance the pVAX1-SARS-CoV2-co
efficacy via dermal injection while previously, an intramuscular injection was used. One of the
limitations of DNA vaccines is the low antibody titer against COVID-19 infections5. PJI can be
applied for injecting pVAX1-SARS-CoV2-co into dermal tissues, where various immune cells are
stimulated upon S protein expression. In PJI, combustion of two types of explosives leads to the
plunger discharging liquid samples in the container toward the target tissue at very high
pressure7. The great advantage of PJI is the adjustment of sample dose and depth of delivery,
which can be targeted by changing the two types of explosives. Different plasmid DNA, luciferase
and ovalbumin (OVA) were successfully delivered to dermal tissue and much higher expression
of these proteins was detected in the target tissue than the classical needle syringe injection.
Moreover, the antibody titer against OVA injection by PJI is more than a hundred times higher
than needle syringe injection at 8 weeks after OVA plasmid DNA injection 4. This study aimed to
determine the safety of a new anti-SARS-CoV-2 DNA vaccine candidate via intradermal jet
injection. Therefore, the adjusted PJI to deliver pVAX1-SARS-CoV2-co to dermal tissue was
employed, and potent anti-COVID-19 immune reactions were confirmed in this study.

Results
pVAX-SARS-CoV2-co vaccine injection to mouse and rat dermal tissue via PJI
A novel injection device, PJI, can introduce pVAX1-SARS-CoV2-co to mouse dermal tissue.
Exactly 20 or 50 l of the pVAX1-SARS-CoV2-co solution was injected into the mouse or rat back
using PJI. An approximately 5-mm wheal in diameter was formed on the back of the mouse/rat
and no bleeding or inflammation observed (Fig1, A, B). Therefore, pVAX1-SARS-CoV2-co could
be efficiently introduced to rat dermal tissue via PJI.
The increase and retention of anti-COVID19 spike protein antibody in the rat serum
pVAX1-SARS-CoV2-co was injected into the back of the rats three times every other week using
PJI (Fig 2A). Blood samples were collected every other week until 12 weeks after the first
injection, and sera were purified from the blood samples. Anti-COVID19 spike protein (S1+S2)
antibody titer at 2, 4, and 6 weeks after the first injection was measured using enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA). After 2 weeks, the antibody titer started to rise and reached the
highest value after 6 weeks (Fig 2B). The antibody titer was measured until after 12 weeks to

confirm antibody retention upon pVAX1-SARS-CoV2-co injection. The antibody titer was the
highest after 6 weeks and gradually decreased toward week 12, but all titers were still very high
until 12 weeks (Fig 2C). To determine the polarization of immunoglobulin subclass profile in rat
sera following vaccine treatment, we analyzed the differences in SARS-CoV2-specific IgG1,
IgG2a, IgG2b, and IgG2c in rat sera harvested 8 weeks after vaccine treatment. Our results
showed that overall SARS-CoV2-specific IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2b levels were high, whereas
IgG2c levels were low (Fig 2D). Importantly, the SARS-CoV2-specific IgG2b subclass was more
elevated than IgG1, indicating that Th1 mediated subclass polarization. Additionally, antibody
titers for RBD of the spike glycoprotein in rat serum were measured. The RBD titers were
elevated weeks 4 and 12 after the first vaccination (Fig 2E). Production of both anti-S1+S2
glycoprotein and anti-RBD antibodies indicated that the intradermal pVAX1-SARS-CoV2-co
injection successfully induced an immune response.
The cellular immune response of rats upon vaccination
To examine Th1/Th2 cellular immune responses to the vaccine, we isolated solenocytes from
vaccinated rats 2 weeks after the final vaccination and analyzed for S1+S2-specific IFN- and IL4-secreting T cells using ELISpot assay. Splenocytes harvested from vaccinated rats showed a
significant increase in IFN--secreting S1+S2-specific T cells (Fig. 3A), whereas IL-4-secreting
S1+S2-specific T cells were detected at much lower numbers (data not shown). This indicated
that intradermal injection of pVAX1-SARS-CoV2-co induced strong Th1-type cellular immune
response.
ACE2 binding inhibition and pseudovirus neutralization assays
To further confirm the neutralizing activity of vaccine-induced antibodies against SARS-CoV-2,
we analyzed the binding inhibition of human ACE2, a receptor of SARS-Cov-2 spike glycoprotein,
with S1+S2 recombinant protein with immunized rat serum using ELISA8. Rat serum collected 2
weeks after the first vaccination showed some inhibition ability (62%) against hACE2 binding of to
the S1+S2 recombinant protein at a 10-fold dilution (Fig 3D). In comparison, rat serum collected
between weeks 4 and 12 showed high neutralizing ability (>90%) against the binding of hACE2 to
S1+S2 recombinant protein at up to 50 folds dilution and maintained high neutralization activity
for 6-8 weeks at up to 250 folds dilution. Correspondingly, neutralization titers against hACE2S1+S2 binding (at 75% inhibitory/neutralization dose (ID 75)) showed a significant jump between
weeks 2 and 4 after the first vaccination, reaching a peak between 6 and 8 weeks, then
decreasing gradually after 8 weeks (Fig 3E). Moreover, pseudovirus neutralization assay, using
pseudotyped vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) with the luciferase gene and Vero E6 cells stably
expressing TMPRSS29-10, was performed to examine the neutralizing activity. A series of rat
serum dilutions 8 weeks after the first vaccination showed strong neutralizing activity against
pseudovirus infection (Fig 3D). Neutralizing titers (ID75) exhibited the highest titer after 6 weeks,
which was about thirty times higher than those after intramuscular injection(Fig 3E).
Increasing injection doses
To assess whether vaccine dosage would affect antibody production and cellular immune
responses, we assessed the pVAX1-SARS-CoV2-co dosage in the range of 100 (low dose) to
400 µg (high dose). When 100 or 400 µg of DNA vaccine was injected into the rat skin, the
antibody production was increased from week 2 to 6 after every injection in both doses. The
maximum antibody titers of the 100 and 400µg DNA vaccination groups were 17056±6331 or
59068±33578 after 6 weeks, respectively. In addition, there was a statistically significant
difference between the antibody titers of 100 and 400 µg injected group after both 4 and 6 weeks
(Fig 4A). To assess whether vaccine dosage would affect Th1/Th2 cellular immune responses,
we compared S1+S2-specific IFN- and IL-4 ELISpot assays between rats vaccinated with 100
g or 400 g of pVAX1-SARS-CoV2-co. Splenocytes harvested from 400 g/high-dose
vaccinated rats showed a significant increase in S1+S2-specific IFN- secretion when re-

stimulated with the antigen, but those from low-dose vaccinated rats exhibited only a modest
increase when re-stimulated (Fig 4B). IL-4-secreting T cells were barely detected in both
vaccinated groups. These results suggested that a high-dose vaccine could induce a stronger
IFN- response compared to the lower dose vaccine, which could lead to a more predominant
Th1-driven cellular immune response.
DNA vaccine prevents viral infection challenge in mice
To assess whether DNA vaccination could prevent viral infection, we injected mice with the
mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 virus (HuDPKng19-020 strain - Q498Y/P499T)11 intradermally (ID;
PJI). Prior to infection challenge 16 weeks post immunization, the antibody titers against S1+S2
in the ID injection group were significantly higher than those in the non-vaccinated (NV) group
(Fig. 5A, Supplemental Fig. 1A). Similarly, the antibody titers for RBD in the ID injection group
were higher than those in the NV group (Fig. 5B, Supplemental Fig. 1B). ID injection group also
displayed stronger inhibitory ability and higher neutralization titers against hACE2-S1+S2 binding
than the NV group (Fig. 5C). After virus infection challenge, no detectable viral load was found in
the lungs of all eight mice in the ID injection group (Fig. 5D, Supplemental Fig. 1D). Taken
together, these results suggested that pVAX1-SARS-CoV2-co immunized mice, especially mice
vaccinated via PJI, could effectively achieve upregulated antibody responses against the spike
protein of SARS-CoV-2.
Safety assessment for pVAX1-SARS-CoV2-co intradermal injection and the immune
response
No animals had died at the time of necropsy or showed abnormalities except for skin reaction.
There was no significant difference in body weight, food consumption, and hematology between
the PBS-injected groups and DNA vaccination groups (Tables 2 to 4). In addition, the urinalysis
data did not show any toxic signs (data not shown). As shown in Table 5, blood biochemistry
revealed significantly lower levels of triglyceride and β-globulin in the 400 µg group compared to
the PBS group. After DNA vaccination, erythema and scab formations were observed at the
injection site for the rats injected with the vaccine, whereas no erythema or scab formation was
observed in the PBS-injected group (Table 6). In the 100-µg DNA vaccine injected group, scab
formation occurred 5, 4, or 3 days after the first, second, or third vaccination, respectively. In
contrast, in the 400-μg DNA vaccine injected group, scab formation occurred 5, 3, or 2 days after
the first, second, or third vaccination, respectively. The scab formation lasted shorter in the high
dose than that in the low-dose group. In addition, recovery from the scab formation was
prolonged depending on the vaccination time. After the first, second, and third injections, the scab
disappeared after 3, 5–7, and 11 days, respectively. However, all scabs disappeared and the skin
recovered 14 days after every injection (Table 6).
Histopathological analysis of lymph nodes revealed slight to mild hyperplasia of follicular lymph
nodes at the inguinal lymph node in 5 of 6 animals in the 400-µg injected group, slight
hyperplasia of follicular was observed in 1 of 6 animals in the 100-µg injected group, and slight
hyperplasia of follicular was observed at the axillary lymph node of one of six animals in the 400µg injected group. Furthermore, hyperplasia of plasma cells was observed only in the 400-µg
injected group. These abnormalities were not observed in the PBS-injected group; thus, this
hyperplasia might be an immune response against pVAX1-SARS-CoV2-co injection. Sperm
reduction in the epididymis, interstitial inflammation of the prostate, or sperm granuloma were
observed; however, these were also observed in the PBS-injected group (Table7).

In the recent COVID-19 pandemic, efficient and safe DNA vaccine development is an important
issue. Thus, we tested the immunogenicity and safety of the combination of human codonoptimized new COVID-19 DNA vaccine candidate (pVAX1-SARS-CoV2-co)4 and PJI7.
Development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 is the priority in many pharmaceutical companies
and academic organizations all over the world. A variety of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, such as
protein subunit12, replicating or non-replicating viral vector13-15, inactivated virus16, live attenuated
virus17-18, virus-like particle (VLP)19-20, RNA-21-22 or DNA-based6, 23-24 vaccines, are currently under
development. DNA vaccines have several advantages compared to traditional vaccines, such as
protein subunits, peptides, and living/inactivated pathogens. Compared to a protein- or peptidebased vaccines or, living/inactivated virus vaccines, DNA vaccine does not require the cultivation
of the target pathogen and can be produced on an industrial scale 25. Furthermore, rapid
adaptation can be applied when mutations occur in the target DNA/RNA sequence. Moreover, the
vaccine administration is another important factor in enhancing efficacy. In recent years, the
major vaccination method has been intramuscular administration using a needle syringe.
Intradermal administration, however, is also a promising vaccination method because dermal
tissue is an easily accessible immune-rich environment that can induce both humoral and cellular
immunity26. Tebas et al. reported that intradermal Ebola GP DNA vaccine administration
demonstrates humoral and cellular immunogenicity advantages compared with intramuscular
administration27.
When 100 or 400 µg of pVAX1-SARS-CoV2-co was injected into the rat, SARS-CoV-2 spike
protein (S1+S2) antibody was detected (Fig 4A). Statistically significant differences were
observed between the 100- and 400-µg pVAX1-SARS-CoV2-co-injected group after 4 and 6
weeks. This meant that the dose-dependent anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S1+S2) antibody
production was induced as described in our previous study using the OVA expression plasmid
DNA4. Interestingly, the antibody was detected in the 2-week sample for both doses. This meant
that the antibody release was induced quickly after the first injection. The potential for rapid
antibody production seemed likely for the vaccination method. In addition, antibody titers were
increased eight times in the low-dose group and 37 times in the high-dose group after the second
injection, and 2-3 times after the third injection. This indicated the importance of the second
injection as an immune booster. Moreover, the number of IFN--producing cells were increased in
the pVAX1-SARS-CoV2-co-injected group, indicating that cellular immunity was elicited via
pVAX1-SARS-CoV2-co intradermal injection. To prevent and cure the viral infection, the
elicitation of cellular immunity is important. Thus, the combination of pVAX1-SARS-CoV2-co and
intradermal injection via PJI is a promising method against SARS-CoV-2.
In the safety test, no animals had died by the time of necropsy and there was no significant
difference in body weight, food consumption, urinalysis, organ weight, and hematology between
PBS- and pVAX1-SARS-CoV2-co-injected groups. As shown in Table 5, blood biochemistry
revealed significantly lower levels of triglyceride and β-globulin in the 400-µg µg group than in the
PBS group. However, these changes were all within the variation of historical data of normal
animals. These results suggested that pVAX1-SARS-CoV2-co injection at these doses did not
cause systemic toxicity in rats. Scab formulation was observed in the injected region, and the
duration between the injection and scab formation became shorter with the vaccination time.
Also, the duration of scab in the high-dose group was shorter than that in the low-dose group
(Table 6). These results suggested that scab formation was related to the immune response
caused by the pVAX1-SARS-CoV2-co injection. However, all scabs disappeared within 14 days
of injection. Slight to mild hyperplasia of follicular or plasma cells was observed in the inguinal
lymph node of 5 in 6 animals and the axillary lymph node of 1 in 6 animals in the high-dose
group, whereas it was observed in the inguinal lymph node of 1 in 6 animals in the low-dose
group (Table 7). The immune response of the high-dose group was higher than that in the lowdose group. Thus, hyperplasia was thought to be an immune response against the antigen
invasion, which was not toxic. Sperm reduction in the epididymis, interstitial inflammation of the

prostate, or sperm granuloma were observed; however, these were observed in the PBS-injected
group as well. Thus, these observations did not indicate any toxic signs.
We evaluated the safety of intradermal vaccination of human codon-optimized COVID-19 DNA
vaccine candidate (pVAX1-SARS-CoV2-co). Intradermal PJI injection of pVAX1-SARS-CoV2-co
did not show any systemic toxicity, whereas erythema and scab formation were observed at skin
injection sites. However, the visual observation and histopathological analysis indicated that these
abnormalities were not permanent and expected to fully recover in time. No other toxic signs were
observed. Thus, these results indicate that intradermal administration of pVAX1-SARS-CoV2-co
is a safe and promising method to induce potent antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.

Materials and Methods
Plasmids
pVAX1-SARS-CoV2-co was designed by Takara, which encoded a highly optimized DNA
sequence encoding the SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein. The plasmid DNA was amplified and
purified using a GIGA prep (Qiagen, USA).
Animals
The rat study was performed using 7-week-old male Crl:CD (SD) rats (Charles River Laboratories
Japan Inc., Kanagawa, Japan). The mouse study was performed using 8-10 weeks old
C57BL/6NCrSlc mice (C57BL/6N) (Japan SLC,Inc.). All animals were maintained under
controlled conditions (temperature: 21.0-24.5 °C, humidity: 45 ± 15%, ventilation: 8–15 times/h,
light/dark cycle: 12 h) in a pathogen-free room. Animals received free access to food and water
and were handled according to the approved protocols of the Animal Committee of Osaka
University (Suita, Osaka, Japan) as No.28-021-028, the Ethics Committee for Animal
Experiments of the Safety Research Institute for Chemical Compounds Co. Ltd. (Sapporo,
Hokkaido, Japan) as No. AN20200617-03 and the Animal Committee of KAC Co. Ltd. (Kusatsu,
Shiga, Japan) as No. 20–0508. All mice experiments were conducted with the approval of the
Animal Research Committee of Research Institute for Microbial Disease in Osaka University
(Suita, Osaka, JAPAN).
Immunogenicity test
Two groups of six animals received pVAX1-SARS-CoV2-co injection in their flunk areas on both
sides every 2 weeks 3 times. For each injection, animals received 30μL plasmid solution injection
at two sites on each side. The injected areas were changed for every injection to prevent
repeated injections at the same site. The sera were collected every 2 weeks under anesthesia
until 12 weeks for the first and second groups for the ELISpot assay.
Safety evaluation
Animals were divided into three groups of six animals, and animals received a pVAX1-SARSCoV2-co injection in their flunk areas on both sides every 2 weeks for three times. For each
injection, the first group received 50 μL of PBS solution at four sites, the second group received
50 μL of plasmid solution at one site, and the third group received 50 μL of plasmid solution at
four sites; thus, each rat received 0, 100, and 400 μg of DNA vaccination in each group. The
injected areas were changed after every injection to prevent repeated injections at the same skin
site. To assess the immune response, sera were collected every 2 weeks under anesthesia until
6 weeks and on day 43, rats were sacrificed. In both experiments, the PJI, ActranzaTM lab. for Rat
was employed for intradermal injection, supplied by Daicel Corporation.

During the treatment period, animals were observed for general signs and observed for skin
reaction of the injected region every day. Body weight and food consumption were measured
once a week. On the day of necropsy, blood for hematology, blood biochemistry, and immuneresponse assays was collected under isoflurane anesthesia. Urine was collected for urinalysis.
After euthanasia and whole blood sampling, the skin region, inguinal lymph node, reproductive
organs, and other organs that were found to be abnormal upon visual observation were extracted
for microscopic examination. All injected skin sites were excised to assess the recovery of the
injection site. The sampled organs were fixed with 10% neutral buffered formalin solution. Thin
paraffin sections were prepared and stained with hematoxylin-eosin and subjected to
histopathological analysis.
ELISA
Precisely 1 g/ml of recombinant 2019-nCoV spike protein (S1+S2) (ECD, His tag) (BLPSN0986P, BETA Life Sciences, Fairfield, NJ, USA) was immobilized on a 96-well plate (442404,
MAXISORP F96 NUNC Immuno-plate, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Roskilde, Denmark) at 4 °C
overnight. After discarding the recombinant protein solution, the plate was incubated with 5%
skim milk in PBS (blocking buffer) for 2 h at room temperature. After blocking, diluted rat sera
(50-, 250-, 1250-, 6250-, 3250- and 156250-fold dilutions for S1+S2 or 10-, 50-, 250-, 1250-,
6250-, 31250-, and 156250-fold dilutions for RBD) or diluted mouse sera (50-, 250-, 1250-, 6250-,
3250-, and 156250-fold dilutions for S1+S2 or 50-, 250-, 1250-, 6250-, and 31250-fold dilutions
for RBD) were incubated at 4℃ overnight. All wells were washed with PBST (200 l/well) seven
times, and incubated with 1:1000 diluted Amersham ECL anti-rat IgG horseradish peroxidaselinked species-specific whole antibody (NA935, GE Healthcare UK Limited, UK) or Amersham
ECL anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase-linked species-specific whole antibody (NA931, GE
Healthcare UK Limited, UK) in the blocking buffer for 3 h at room temperature. After washing with
50 l/well of PBST four times, 50 l/well of 3,3’-5,5’-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) Liquid Substrate
System for ELISA (T040, Sigma-Aldrich Co. LLC., St. Louis, MO) was added to the plate. After 30
min of incubation, 50 l/well of 0.9 N H2SO4 solution was added and OD450nm was measured
using an iMark Microplate Reader (1681135J, Bio Rad, Hercules, CA). The values of the halfmaximal antibody titers of serum samples were calculated from the highest absorbance in the
dilution range using Prism 8 (Graph Pad Software Inc. San Diego, CA 92018, USA).
ELISpot assays
For splenocyte preparations, rat spleens were harvested from the vaccinated rats after 6 weeks.
Splenocytes were passed through a 70-m cell strainer in RPMI 1640 medium (Nacalai Tesque
Inc., Kyoto, Japan) supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml penicillin-streptomycin (Nacalai Tesque Inc.).
Residual erythrocytes were lysed using hemolysis buffer (Immuno-Biological Laboratories Co.,
Ltd., Gunma, Japan) for 5 min and washed with PBS. Splenocytes were subsequently cultured in
complete RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; GE Healthcare
Life Sciences, Logan, UT), 0.1 mg/ml penicillin-streptomycin, and 50 M -mercaptoethanol
(Nacalai Tesque Inc.) and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO 2. Rat IFN-
and IL-4 ELISpot assays (CT079 and CT081, U-CyTech biosciences, Utrecht, Netherlands) were
performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Rat splenocytes (2 × 105) were plated in
duplicate in 96-well PVDF plates (Millipore, Billerica, MA) and stimulated with 5 g/ml of
recombinant 2019-nCoV Spike protein (S1+S2 ECD, His tag; Beta Lifescience, Fairfield, NJ) for
48 h. The resultant stained well membranes were scanned, and the number of spot-forming cells
was counted.
IgG subclass analysis
To analyze the immunoglobulin subclass profile in sera of vaccinated rats, standardized ELISA
protocols were performed. Briefly, 96-well plates were coated with 10 µg/ml SARS-CoV-2 SV2

recombinant protein at 4 °C overnight. Serum samples were incubated in appropriate wells at
4 °C overnight. After serum incubation, the serum samples were removed and IgG subtypes were
detected using the following HRP-conjugated antibodies for 3 h at room temperature; anti-IgG1
H&L (ab106753; Abcam), anti-IgG2a H&L (ab106783; Abcam). anti-IgG2b H&L (ab106750;
Abcam), and anti-IgG2c (3075–05, Southern Biotech). After HRP-conjugated antibody detection,
plates were developed using POD (T0440; Sigma) and stopping buffer (9562606; Nacalai
Tesque) and the absorbance was detected at 450 nm (iMark; Bio rad).
ACE2 binding inhibition assay
To analyze the binding inhibition of S1+S2 and ACE2 by neutralizing antibodies in the immunized
rat and mouse serum, 96-well plates were coated with human ACE2 recombinant protein (1g/ml,
mFc tag; #83986, Cell Signaling Technology), and then blocked using PBS containing 5% skim
milk for 2 h at room temperature. After blocking, pre-incubated samples of diluted rat or mouse
serum with recombinant S1+S2 protein (2 g/ml, His tag; Beta Lifescience) was added to the
coated wells and incubated at 4 oC overnight. Wells were washed with PBST and then incubated
with anti-His antibody conjugated with HRP (GTX21187, GeneTex, Inc., Irvine, CA) for 2 h at
room temperature. After washing with PBST, the peroxidase chromogenic substrate TMB (SigmaAldrich) was added to the wells and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction was
stopped by adding 0.5 N sulfuric acid. The absorbance at 450 nm was measured using a
microplate reader (Bio rad). Percentage inhibition of immunized blood serum at various time
points was calculated and plotted using GraphPad Prism software, from which the neutralization
titer at ID75 was derived.
Pseudovirus neutralization assay for SARS-CoV-2
The neutralizing activity of vaccine-induced antibodies was analyzed using pseudotyped VSVs,
as previously described10. Briefly, Vero E6 cells stably expressing TMPRSS2 were seeded on 96well plates and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Pseudoviruses were incubated with a series of
dilutions of inactivated rat serum for 1 h at 37 °C and then added to Vero E6 cells. Exactly 24 h
after infection, the cells were lysed with cell culture lysis reagent (Promega), and luciferase
activity was measured using a Centro XS3 LB 960 (Berthold).
SARS-CoV-2 infection in mice that received pVAX1-SARS-CoV2-co plasmids
Female mice intradermally received pVAX1-SARS-CoV-2-co plasmids. For the ID injection,
animals received 160 µg of plasmid at two sites on each flank using PJI for mouse of ActranzaTM
lab. Animals received 20μl (40μg) pVAX-SARS-CoV-2-co plasmid at two sites on each side,
totally 160μg of plasmid for each mouse, using PJI. pVAX1-SARS-CoV-2-co plasmids were
administered on days 0 and 14. Sixteen weeks after the first administration, sera were collected
from immunized mice and tested for antibody induction against 2019-nCoV spike protein (S1+S2)
and the RBD region of the spike protein, as well as for the inhibition of binding to the recombinant
hACE2 protein.
The mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 virus (HuDPKng19-020 strain-Q498Y/P499T) was generated
in vitro using reverse genetics11, 28. The infectious titers in the culture supernatants were
determined analyzing the 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID50). Mice were intranasally
infected with 2.0 × 105 TCID50 mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 virus. Two days post infection,
lungs were isolated and 0.02 g of the tissue was homogenized using 100 µl of PBS. The
homogenate solution was serially diluted 10 folds in DMEM containing 2% FBS and loaded on
VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells to determine the value.

Body weight, food consumption, hematology and blood biochemistry, urinalysis, and organ weight
were analyzed using MiTox (Mitsui Toxicological Data Processing System, Mitsui E&S Systems
Research Inc., Tokyo, Japan). The statistical analysis for antibody titers and ELISpot was
performed using BellCurve for Excel (Social Survey Research Information Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). A pvalue less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

A) Pre-viral challenge of mice immunized with 160 μg of pVAX1-SARS-CoV2-co plasmid
intradermally (ID; n = 8) or no-vaccinated (NV: n=10) two times at 2-week intervals. Antibody titer
(half maximum) for recombinant S1+S2 in the blood serum 16 weeks post initial vaccination,
assessed using ELISA. P<0.001 Student’s t-test. B) Antibody titer (half maximum) for
recombinant RBD in the blood serum in ID and NV mice. P=0.018 Student’s t-test. C)
Neutralization titer (ID75) for recombinant ACE2-S1+S2 binding inhibition in the blood serum of
ID mice. D) ID and NV (n=10) mice were intranasally infected with mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2
virus. 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID50) values in the lung tissues of each animal are
shown. P=0.016 Student’s t-test . All individual values are shown in Supplemental Fig. 1.
