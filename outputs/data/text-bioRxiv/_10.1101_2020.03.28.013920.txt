Abstract
Many of the proteins produced by SARS-CoV-2 have related counterparts across the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARSCoV) family. One such protein is non-structural protein 9 (Nsp9), which is thought to mediate both viral replication and virulence.
Current understanding suggests that Nsp9 is involved in viral genomic RNA reproduction. Nsp9 is thought to bind RNA via a fold
that is unique to this class of betacoronoaviruses although the molecular basis for this remains ill-defined. We sought to better
characterise the SARS-CoV-2 Nsp9 protein and subsequently solved its X-ray crystal structure, in an apo-form and, unexpectedly, in a
peptide-bound form with a sequence originating from a rhinoviral 3C protease sequence (LEVL). The structure of the SARS-CoV-2
Nsp9 revealed the high level of structural conservation within the Nsp9 family. The exogenous peptide binding site is close to the dimer
interface and impacted on the relative juxtaposition of the monomers within the homodimer. Together we have established a protocol
for the production of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp9, determined its structure and identified a peptide-binding site that may warrant further study
from the perspective of understanding Nsp9 function.

Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) is comprised of a large single stranded positive polarity RNA genome
that acts as messenger RNA after entering the host. Post infection, the
ssRNA encodes two open reading frames, produced through host
ribosomal frameshifting that transcribes two polyprotein products. The
polyprotein products are subsequently cleaved into 27 viral proteins by
internally encoded proteases. Further processing of the polyprotein
releases an RNA-polymerase along with several non-structural proteins
that facilitate RNA synthesis and may play a role in the enveloping
process but are not included in the viral coat.
Treatment of infections caused by betacoronoaviruses have
focused on three therapeutic strategies; vaccination with the spike
glycoprotein of the SARS-Cov-2 envelope (Wrapp et al., 2020), and
small-molecule targeting of conserved viral enzymes (e.g. the Mpro
protease (Zhenming et al. 2020) (Yang et al., 2005) and the RNApolymerase (Yan et al. 2020). Nevertheless, some of the betacoronaviral
non-structural proteins appear important for viral replication within
SARS-CoV and influence pathogenesis (Frieman et al., 2012). Despite
their close homology between viruses, such non-structural proteins
remain of interest as they may have conserved roles within the viral
lifecycle of SARS-CoV-2.
During infection of human cells, SARS-CoV Non-structural
protein 9 (Nsp9SARS) was found to be important for replication (Frieman
et al., 2012). Homologs of the Nsp9 protein have been identified in
numerous coronaviruses including SARS-Cov-2 (Nsp9COV19), human
coronavirus 229E (Nsp9HcoV), avian infectious bronchitis virus
(Nsp9IBV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (Nsp9PEDV) and porcine delta
virus (Nsp9PDCoV). Nsp9SARS has been shown to have modest affinity for
long oligonucleotides with binding thought to be dependent on
oligomerisation state (Egloff et al., 2004) (Sutton et al., 2004). Nsp9SARS
dimerises in solution via a conserved a-helical ‘GxxxG’ motif.
Disruption of key residues within this motif reduces both RNA-binding

(Sutton et al., 2004) and SARS-CoV viral proliferation (Frieman et al.,
2012). The mechanism of RNA binding within the Nsp9 protein family
is not understood as these proteins have an unusual structural fold not
previously seen in RNA binding proteins (Egloff et al., 2004) (Sutton et
al., 2004). The fold’s Greek-key motif exhibits topological similarities
with OB-fold proteins and small protein B but such vestiges have proven
insufficient to provide clear insight into Nsp9 function (Egloff et al.,
2004). As a consequence of the weak affinity of Nsp9SARS for long
oligonucleotide stretches it was suggested that the natural RNA substrate
may instead be conserved features at the 3’ end of the viral-genome (the
stem-loop II RNA-motif) (Ponnusamy et al., 2008). Furthermore,
potential direct interactions with the co-factors of the RNA polymerase
have been reported (Chen et al., 2017). However, it remains to be
determined how the oligonucleotide-binding activity of Nsp9 proteins
promote viral replication during infection.
The sequence of Nsp9 homologues are conserved amongst
betacoronoaviruses, yet there remains the potential for functional
differences in different viruses. Nsp9COV19 exhibits 97% sequence
identity with Nsp9SARS but only 44% sequence identity with Nsp9HCoV.
The structure of the HCoV-229E Nsp9 protein suggested a potential
oligomeric switch induced upon the formation of an intersubunit
disulfide bond. Here, disulfide bond formation shifts the relative
orientation of the Nsp9 monomers, which was suggested to promote
higher-order oligomerisation (Ponnusamy et al., 2008). The resultant
rod-like higher order Nsp9HCoV assemblies had increased affinity for the
RNA oligonucleotides. Cysteine mutants of Nsp9HCoV that are unable to
produce the disulfide displayed reduced RNA-binding affinity
(Ponnusamy et al., 2008). The observation of a redox-induced structural
switch of Nsp9HCoV led to the hypothesis that Nsp9HCoV may have a
functional role in sensing the redox status of the host cell (Ponnusamy et
al., 2008). While the “redox-switch” cysteine responsible for oligomer
formation in Nsp9HCoV is conserved amongst different viral Nsp9
homologues the higher-order oligomers were not observed for Nsp9SARS

(Ponnusamy et al., 2008). Because of these potential differences between
Nsp9 proteins we sought to further characterise the nature of Nsp9COV19.
Results
Expression and purification of the SARS-CoV-2 Nsp9 protein
The Nsp9 protein from SARS-CoV-2 (Nsp9COV19) was cloned
and recombinantly expressed in E. coli. The expression construct
included an N-terminal Hexa-His tag attached via a rhinoviral 3Cprotease site. Following Ni-affinity chromatography Nsp9COV19 was
further purified via size-exclusion chromatography to yield > 95% pure
and homogeneous protein. Nsp9COV19 eluted from gel filtration columns
with the apparent molecular weight of a dimer suggesting that, as with
other Nsp9 proteins, Nsp9COV19 is an obligate homodimer. The Nterminal tag was removed prior to any biochemical experiments via
overnight digestion with precision protease, as reported for Nsp9SARS
(Sutton et al., 2004).
Nucleotide binding of Nsp9COV19 protein
The affinity of viral Nsp9 homologues for oligonucleotides has
a range of binding affinities reported, some of which are dependent on
oligomerisation state and nucleotide length, ranging from 20-400 μM
(Zeng et al., 2018). We therefore sought to assess the potential for
Nsp9COV19 to bind to fluorescently labelled oligonucleotides using
fluorescence anisotropy. Preliminary experiments were performed under
conditions similar to those previously identified for Nsp9SARS (Sutton et
al., 2004). Oligonucleotide affinity was very limited under our assay
conditions (Fig. 1). Indeed, protein concentrations up to 200 µM of

Fig. 1 - Nsp9COV19 nucleotide-binding assay.
Fluorescence polarization anisotropy assays were used to examine the
possibility that Nsp9COV19 could bind to labelled 17-mer and 10-mer single
stranded oligonucleotides. The plot shows corrected anisotropy for each
Nsp9COV19 protein concentration, error bars represent the SD from the
mean of triplicate measurements after 60 minutes incubation.

Nsp9COV19 did not result in saturated binding and thus indicated an
incredibly low affinity KD, or no affinity for these oligonucleotides at all
under these assay conditions.
Crystal structure of apo-Nsp9COV19
We next determined the structure of apo-Nsp9COV19 (Table 1).
The apo-Nsp9COV19 structure aligned closely to that of Nsp9SARS
(R.M.S.D of 0.57Å over 113 Cα, Fig. 2A-C) (Egloff et al., 2004). Like
other Nsp9 homologues it exhibits an unusual fold that is yet to be
observed outside of coronaviruses (Sutton et al., 2004). The core of the

fold is a small 6-stranded enclosed β-barrel, from which a series of
extended loops project outward (Fig 2A). The elongated loops link the
individual β-strands of the barrel, along with a projecting N-terminal βstrand and C-terminal α1-helix; the latter two elements make up the main

4A), the N-terminal turns of the helix were relatively isolated, only
making contacts with counterpart protomer residues. In contrast, the Cterminal portions were encircled by hydrophobic residues, albeit at a
distance that created funnel-like hydrophobic cavities either side of the
interfacing helices (Fig. 3A). Strands β1, β6 and the protein’s C-terminus
served to provide a ring of residues that encircled the paired helices. The
first 10 residues of Nsp9COV19 exchanged across the dimer-interface to
form a strand-like extension of β1 that ran alongside β6 from the other
protomer (Fig. 3A). The interaction these strands made did not appear
optimal, indeed the remaining four C-terminal residues projected
sideways across the dimer interface, inserting between the two strands
while contributing a hydrophobic backing to the main helix.
Extraneous peptides occupy the hydrophobic cavities of Nsp9
In a separate crystallisation experiment we determined the
structure of Nsp9COV19 that included the N-terminal tag together with a
rhinoviral 3C protease sequence (termed 3C-Nsp9COV19). The 3CNsp9COV19 crystal form diffracted to 2.05 Å resolution in space group
P4322, and had 1 molecule within the asymmetric unit, with the dimer
being created across the crystallographic 2-fold axis.

components of the dimer interface (Fig. 3A). Two loops project from the
open-face of the barrel: the β2-3- and β3-4-loops are both positively
charged, glycine rich, and are proposed to be involved in RNA-binding.
The only protrusion on the enclosed barrel-side is the β6-7-loop; the Cterminal half of the β7-strand is an integral part of the fold’s barrel-core
but its other half extended outward to pair with the external β6-strand and
create a twisted β-hairpin, cupping the α1-helix and interacting with
subsequent C-terminal residues.
The arrangement of monomers within Nsp9-dimers is wellconserved in different viruses and is maintained within Nsp9COV19
(R.M.S.D of 0.66Å over 226Cα compared to the dimeric unit of
Nsp9SARS). The main component of the intersubunit interaction is the
self-association of the conserved GxxxG protein-protein binding motif
(Fig. 3C) that allowed backbone van der Waals interactions between
interfacing copies of the C-terminal α1-helix (Hu et al. 2017). Here Gly100 of the respective parallel α1-helices, formed complementary
backbone van der Waals interactions. These interactions were replicated
after a full helical turn by Gly-104 of the respective chains, thereby
forming the molecular basis of the Nsp9COVID19 dimer interface (Fig. 3C).
The 2-fold axis that created the dimer ran at a ~15 ° angle through the
GxxxG motif allowing the 14-residue helix to cross its counterpart (Fig.

Unexpectedly the high-resolution structure of 3C-Nsp9COV19
diverged from that of the apo-Nsp9COV19 (R.M.S.D 0.86 Å for the
monomer and 2.23 Å when superimposing a dimer). The 3C sequence
folded-around either side of the paired intersubunit helices to fill two
funnel-like hydrophobic cavities (Fig. 2D, 3B, 4C, D). Namely, 3C
residues LEVL, inserted into the opposing cavities either side of the
dimer interface and ran parallel to the paired GxxxG motif. Moreover,
the 3C sequence formed additional β-sheet interactions with the Nterminus of the protein from the other protomer (Fig. 3B). To
accommodate the 3C residues the N-terminal strand residues moved
outward by ~1.6 Å (residues 6-10). This movement allowed the Nterminus to increase the number of β-sheet interactions it formed with
β6’. The β-barrel core of the fold remained unchanged but the increase in
interactions between β1 and β6’ served to exclude the C-terminus,
prompting residues 106-111 to condense into a bent extension of the ahelix (Fig. 4A, B). The subtle structural changes near the interacting
GxxxG motifs (Fig. 3D) are amplified at the periphery of the dimer
resulting in ~ 6 Å shift in the β-barrel core (Fig. 4C)
Conserved cavity residues accommodate a peptide backbone
When comparing apo-Nsp9COV19 with 3C-Nsp9COV19 the point
where the N-terminal interface strand diverges is near Leu-9 (Fig. 3D).
Within the apo form it makes van der Waals interactions with the
sidechains of Met-101, Asn-33 and Ser-105; this latter serine is important
as it immediately follows the conserved protein-binding motif
(100GMVLGS105), while also specifically interacting with Gly104’ from
the opposing protomer. Within the 3C-Nsp9COV19 structure the extraneous
LEVL residues insert at this point (Fig. 5B), the hydrophobic side chains
clasp either side of Ser-105 and allowed its hydroxyl group to form
backbone hydrogen bonds to the glutamate within the extraneous
sequence (Fig. 5B). Meanwhile the C-terminal Leucine from the
extraneous residues inserted behind the a-helix of the other protomer
(Fig. 5B). Cumulatively these changes allow for a ~5° rotation of the
protomer subunits about the 2-fold axis compared to apo-Nsp9COV19 (Fig.
4C).
Most residues involved in protein-binding within the
hydrophobic cavity and the structural changes needed to accommodate
them appear broadly conserved amongst other Nsp9 viral homologues
(red highlights in Fig. 5A). The main exception to this is Ser-105, which

(Ponnusamy et al., 2008), (Zeng et al., 2018). However, the N-terminal
interface β-strand in these homologues is known to be involved in
interface re-organisation of the subunits (Ponnusamy et al., 2008) and
thus denotes other structural differences at this site.
Discussion
Here we describe the structure of the recombinantly expressed
Nsp9COV19 as part of a global effort to characterise the virus causing a
current global pandemic. Nsp9 is important for virulence in SARS-CoV
(Miknis et al., 2009). It remains to be understood whether Nsp9COV19
plays a similar role in SARS-CoV-2, however the 97 % sequence identity
suggests a high degree of functional conservation. The CoV Nsp9
proteins are seemingly obligate dimers comprising a unique fold that
associates via an unusual a-helical GxxxG interaction motif. The
integrity of this motif is considered important for viral replication
(Miknis et al., 2009), leading to a proposal that disruption of the unusual
dimer interface impacts on RNA binding and function (Hu et al., 2017).
Mutation of the same interaction motif in the porcine delta coronavirus
Nsp9PDCoV also disrupted nucleotide binding capacity (Zeng et al., 2018).
We describe the ability to produce homogenous Nsp9COV19
which purifies as an obligate dimer, consistent with other Nsp9 proteins.

Our preliminary nucleotide binding assays brought into question the
RNA binding capacity of Nsp9COV19. The structure of the Nsp9COV19
showed conservation of the unique Nsp9 fold when compared with
homologues from SARS (Egloff et al., 2004) (Sutton et al., 2004).
Indeed, the topological fold was conserved as was the Nsp9 specific ahelical GxxxG dimerisation interface. This a-helical interface is
encircled by hydrophobic residues but the interface includes considerable
cavities as observed previously (Egloff et al., 2004). We made a
serendipitous discovery in our 3C-Nsp9COV19 structure, whereby the
hydrophobic cavity captured the 3C cleavage sequence LEVL. The
extraneous residues were tightly bound on all sides within the site
situating themselves proximal to the conserved GxxxG motif.
Coordination of the 3C sequence induced changes within interfacing
residues, serving to both restructure key structural elements and cause a
modest shift in subunit orientation.
At this stage it is unclear whether the bound residues within our
structure have any bearing on the physiological function of Nsp9COV19. In
the first instance this would seem unlikely, however our sequence is that
of a rhinoviral 3C protease site and the SARS-CoV main protease cleaves
consensus sequences following an LQ sequence (Zhu et al., 2011). The
bound 3C-LE residues have hallmarks of the LQ motif and are proximal
to the highly conserved GxxxG motif. There are no obvious structural
features to preclude, or select for, a Glu to Gln substitution within our

bound sequence. Notably the Mpro cleavage sequence occurs at multiple
points throughout the CoV genome as the majority of viral
proteins are released by its activity, thus it remains possible that Nsp9
may associate with unprocessed viral polyproteins retaining them near
the viral RNA. Within our structure Met-101 provides contacts with the
bound valine sidechain but the presence of Asn-33 nearby may also
accommodate residues such as lysine at this position. Peptide-binding
assays will need to be developed to rigorously assess such possibilities.
In summary we have established a protocol for the production and
purification of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp9 protein. We determined the structure
of the Nsp9COV19 and described the conservation of the unique fold and
dimerisation interface identified previously for members of this protein
family. We also determined structure of Nsp9COV19 in complex with a 3C
sequence, although the significance of this is yet to be established. The
structures we describe here could potentially be utilised in drug screening

(MAHHHHHHSAALEVLFQGPG). The plasmid was transformed into
E. coli BL21(DE3) cells which were grown in Luria Broth at 37°C until
reaching an Absorbance at 600nm of ~1.0 before being induced with
0.5mM Isopropyl β- d-1-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 hours. Cells were
harvested in 20mM HEPES pH 7.0, 150mM NaCl, 20mM Imidazole,
2mM MgCl2 and 0.5mM TCEP and frozen until required. Lysis was
achieved by sonicating the cells in the presence of 1mg of Lysozyme and
1mg of DNAase on ice. The lysate was then cleared by centrifugation at
10,000xg for 20 minutes and loaded onto a nickel affinity column. Bound
protein was washed extensively with 20 column volumes of 20mM
HEPES pH 7.0, 150mM NaCl, 0.5mM TCEP before being eluted in the
same buffer with the addition of 400mM Imidazole. For His-tag removal
samples were incubated with precision 3c protease overnight at 4°C. All
samples were subjected to gel filtration (S75 16/60; GE Healthcare) in
20mM HEPES pH 7.0, 150mM NaCl before being concentrated to
50mg/mL for crystallization trials.
Nsp9COV19 crystallized in 2.0-2.2M NH4SO4 and 0.1M
Phosphate-citrate buffer pH 4.0. Crystals of the His-tag samples grew
with rectangular morphology in space group P4122, however if the Histag was removed the crystals grew in space group P6122 form with
hexagonal morphology. All diffraction data were collected at the
Australian synchrotron’s MX2 beamline at the Australian synchrotron
(Aragao et al., 2018) (see Table 1 for details). Data were integrated in
XDS (Kabsch, 2010), processed with SCALA, phases were obtained
through molecular replacement using PDB 1QZ8 (Egloff et al., 2004) as
a search model. Subsequent rounds of manual building and refinement
were performed in Coot (Casanal et al., 2019) and PHENIX (Liebschner
et al., 2019).
Nucleotide binding assay
To examine the RNA-binding affinity, an 18-point serial
dilution (212-0 µM) of Nsp9COV19 was incubated with 1 nM 5'Fluorescein labelled 17mer poly-U single-stranded RNA (Dharmacon
GE, USA) or 10mer PolyT single-stranded DNA (IDT, USA) in assay
buffer (20mM HEPES pH 7.0, 150mM NaCl, 2mM MgCl2) at room
temperature.
The assay was performed in 96-well non-binding black plates
(Greiner Bio-One), with fluorescence anisotropy measured in triplicate
using the PHERAstar FS (BMG) with FP 488-520-520 nm filters. The
data was corrected using the anisotropy of RNA sample alone, then fitted
by a one-site binding model using the Equation, A = (Amax
[L])/(KD+[L]), where A is the corrected fluorescence anisotropy; Amax
is maximum binding fluorescence anisotropy signal, [L] is the Nsp9COV19
concentration, and KD is the dissociation equilibrium constant. Amax and
KD were used as fitting parameters and nonlinear regression was
performed using GraphPad Prism. Measurements were taken after 60
minutes incubation between protein and RNA.
