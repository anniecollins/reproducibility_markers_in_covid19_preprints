ABSTRACT

39

The on-going coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has

40

infected hundreds of millions of people and killed more than two million people worldwide.

41

Currently, there are no effective drugs available for treating SARS-CoV-2 infections;

42

however, vaccines are now being administered worldwide to control this virus. In this study,

43

we have studied SARS-CoV-2 helicase, Nsp13, which is critical for viral replication. We

44

compared the Nsp13 sequences reported from India with the first reported sequence from

45

Wuhan province, China to identify and characterize the mutations occurring in this protein.

46

To correlate the functional impact of these mutations, we characterised the most prominent

47

B cell and T cell epitopes contributed by Nsp13. Our data revealed twenty-one epitopes,

48

which exhibited high antigenicity, stability and interactions with MHC class-I and class-II

49

molecules. Subsequently, the physiochemical properties of these epitopes were also

50

analysed. Furthermore, several of these Nsp13 epitopes harbour mutations, which were

51

further characterised by secondary structure and per-residue disorderness, stability and

52

dynamicity predictions. Altogether, we report the candidate epitopes of Nsp13 that may help

53

the scientific community to understand the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 variants and their

54

probable implications.

INTRODUCTION

76

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease was first reported from Wuhan province,

77

China in the late 2019 [1–3]. The causative agent of this disease was identified as Severe

78

Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Corona Virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which shares considerable

79

similarity with previously known coronavirus, SARS-CoV [4]. Coronaviruses are a group of

80

RNA viruses, which can infect diverse animals, including humans [5]. Earlier reports have

81

shown that at least six different coronaviruses are known to infect humans, including CoV-

82

229E, CoV-OC43, CoV-NL63, CoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV [6]. Four of them do

83

not cause any serious health implication on humans including CoV-229E, CoV-OC43, CoV-

84

NL63, and CoV-HKU1 but serious respiratory issues have been linked to SARS-CoV and

85

MERS-CoV infection [7]. The SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh coronavirus to infect humans and

86

also causes mild to severe respiratory illness in the infected individuals and reported to

87

cause severe symptoms in immune-compromised patients. The SARS-CoV-2 rapidly spread

88

worldwide within few months and become one of the worst pandemic ever reported in

89

human history [8]. Still this virus is spreading and already triggered second and third wave of

90

infections in many countries. As of 18th March 2021, more than 120 million cases of COVID-

91

19 were reported worldwide with more than 2.6 million deaths.

92

SARS-CoV-2 genome is comprised of a positive sense single stranded RNA of

93

approximately 29kb [9]. Its genome encodes four structural, sixteen non-structural and nine

94

accessory proteins [10]. The non-structural proteins are involved in the maintenance of

95

functional integrity of the virus and also required for infection and virus particle formation.

96

Numerous RNA viruses have been found to encode their own RNA helicases, which are

97

usually indispensable components of the RNA replication complexes [11,12] and recognized

98

as an ideal targets for developing antivirals [13]. Nsp13, an RNA helicase, plays an

99

important role in the folding of its RNA elements or unwinding of double stranded RNAs.

100

Previous studies have shown that SARS-CoV Nsp13 has an NTPase and helicase activity

101

belonging to helicase superfamily-1 [14]. The SARS-CoV-2 Nsp13 helicase shares a 99.8%

102

sequence identity to SARS-CoV (SARS) Nsp13 helicase [15]. Nsp13 helicase is a critical

103

component for viral replication and shares the highest sequence conservation across the

104

CoV family, highlighting their importance for viral viability. RNA dependent RNA polymerase

105

(RdRp) and Nsp13 are required for viral replication, therefore, both of these vital enzyme

106

represents a promising target for anti-CoV drug development [16].

107

In order to understand the host response towards SARS-CoV-2, we performed in-silico study

108

to characterize Nsp13. We used several bioinformatic tools to predict potential epitopes of

109

Nsp13 and characterised them by studying several immunological parameters. Further, we

110

systematically characterized the mutations in Nsp13 reported from India and their impacts on

111

epitopes are discussed.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

113

Nsp13 sequence retrieval and multiple sequence alignment (MSA)

114

The Orf1ab of SARS-CoV-2 contains Nsp1-16 as a single polypeptide which is proteolytically

115

cleaved into individual proteins. The Orf1ab sequences used in this study were downloaded

116

from NCBI-virus database. Till 3rd March 2021, 651 sequences of Orf1ab have been

117

reported from India. We have downloaded all these sequences and their protein accession

118

number are listed in the supplementary table 1. The Nsp13 sequences were retrieved from

119

their respective Orf1ab and used for analysis. The Orf1ab sequence reported from Wuhan,

120

China was used as a reference sequence (Protein accession number: YP_009724389) for

121

MSA studies using Clustal Omega tool [17] as described earlier [18].

122
123

B cell epitope prediction

124

Linear B cell epitopes were predicted using IEDB (Immune Epitope Database and Analysis

125

Resource) [19], an online server tool based on Bepipred linear epitope prediction method (at

126

the threshold value of 0.350). IEDB prediction tool was also used to predict the Nsp13

127

immunological parameters including the antigenicity, accessibility, flexibility, hydropathicity

128

and beta turn. These standard parameters were estimated by Chou and Fasman beta-turn

129

prediction algorithm, Emini surface accessibility server tool, Karplus and Schulz flexibility

130

prediction tool, Kolaskar and Tongaonkar antigenicity and Parker hydrophilicity prediction

131

algorithms, respectively [20,21]. The DiscoTope 2.0 was used for prediction of Discontinuous

132

B cell epitope using threshold value set at -5.5 and its three dimensional structure were

133

represented by AutoDock software. Antigenicity and allergenicity of B cell epitopes were

134

predicted by Vaxijen 2.0 [22] and AllergenFP v.1.0 [23] servers, respectively.

135
136

T cell epitope prediction

137

On the surface of antigenic presenting cell, T cell epitopes are presented where they are

138

attached to Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecule. MHC class I and class II

139

molecules were predicted as follows-

140

MHC class I molecule: IEDB webserver based on NetMHCpanEL 4.1 was used for

141

prediction of MHC class I molecules [24]. For this prediction, we selected HLA reference

142

alleles (a total of 54 alleles) having epitope length of 9 or 10 mers. We finally sorted 9 mers

143

conserved epitopes that show maximum binding interaction at IC50 < 200nm. Antigenicity of

144

all selected epitopes was predicted from Vaxijen 2.0 webserver, whereas allergenicity was

145

predicted by AllergenFP v.1.0.

146

MHC class II molecules: IEDB recommended 2.22 prediction method was used to predict

147

MHC class II epitopes. For this prediction, we selected the seven standard reference alleles

148

having maximum length of 11 mers. Subsequently, we sorted most conserved 9 mers

149

epitopes that exhibited maximum binding interaction with other alleles. Antigenicity of all

150

selected epitopes was predicted from Vaxijen 2.0 webserver, whereas allergenicity was

151

predicted by AllergenFP v.1.0.

152
153

Physiological profiling of T cell epitopes-

154

The characterisation of selected MHC class I and MHC class II epitopes were performed by

155

several webservers. The physiological parameters including toxicity, hydrophobicity,

156

hydropathicity, charge PI and molecular weight were calculated by Toxinpred tool [25].

157

Another webserver tool HLP [26] was used to predict half-life, surface accessibility, flexibility

158

and polarity of the selected epitopes.

159
160

Structure modelling, secondary structure analysis and protein disorder prediction

161

The locations of identified mutations were highlighted in the three-dimensional structure of

162

Nsp13 using UCSF Chimera program [27]. The Nsp13 RCSB-ID: 6ZSL was used for the

163

structural representation. The prediction of secondary structure was performed by CFSSP

164

webserver [28] as described earlier [29]. The input sequence was uploaded on this server,

165

which provides the secondary structure in terms of alpha-helix, beta-sheet and turns. The

166

prediction of per residue intrinsic disorder predisposition contributed by each residue of input

167

Nsp13 polypeptide sequence was performed by PONDR-VSL2 webserver [30]. The value

168

above 0.5 is considered ordered while the value below 0.5 is considered disordered.

169
170

Stability of protein structure

171

The stability of protein structure was predicted by DynaMut webserver [31]. The reported

172

structure of Nsp13 (RCSB-ID: 6ZSL) was used to predict the impact if mutation on the

173

stability of protein. First, the protein structure was uploaded onto the webserver, followed by

174

providing the details of the mutation for analysis as described earlier [32]. This webserver

175

predict the differences in free energy between the wild type and mutant protein.

RESULTS

178

Identification of variations in nsp13 protein among Indian isolates

179

We compared the Nsp13 sequences reported from India with the first reported sequence

180

from Wuhan province, China using Clustal omega tool. Our analysis revealed twenty-seven

181

mutations have taken place among Indian isolates, which is distributed all over the Nsp13

182

protein as shown in figure 1A. Next, we observed the location of these mutations in the

183

three-dimensional structure of Nsp13 using UCSC Chimera tool as shown in figure 1B. We

184

also looked at the polarity change and charge alteration due to the mutation in Nsp13, our

185

data revealed that most of mutation does not led to any change (neutral to neutral) however,

186

at two positions it changed from acidic to neutral (E142V and E168A) while at three locations

187

it altered from basic to neutral (H164Y, R392C and R442Q) as shown in table 1.

188
189

Prediction of B cell epitope contributed by Nsp13

190

IEDB webserver tool was used for predicting the continuous B-cell epitopes of Nsp13 (figure

191

2A). Our analysis revealed seven best antigenic epitopes that were more than 8 amino acid

192

residue in length (figure 2B). Subsequently, these epitopes were further characterised by

193

analysing various parameters, including vaxijen score, allergenicity, and toxicity (figure 2B).

194

Our prediction data revealed that all of them are non-toxic however, 5 peptides

195

(CNAPGCDVT, CVGSDNVT, VGKPRPPLN, TFEKGDYGDA and GDPAQLPAP) possess

196

alleregenicity properties and two peptides are non-allergen (TQTVDSSQGSEY and

197

STLQGPPGTGKS). Similarly, three of them exhibited antigenic property while four are non-

198

antigenic (figure 2B).

199

Subsequently, we predicted the B cell epitopes of Nsp13 based on its three dimensional

200

structure using DiscoTop 2.0 webserver tool [33].

201

discontinuous epitopes of Nsp13 having high score. The location of these epitopes are

202

highlighted on the 3D structure of Nsp13 (figure 2C) and their additional details are shown in

203

figure 2D. Altogether, our data revealed B –cell epitopes contributed by Nsp13.

Our analysis revealed the eleven

205

Analysis of essential parameters of B cell epitopes

206

Subsequently, all essential parameters of B Cell epitopes including Beta turn, accessibility of

207

surface, flexibility, antigenicity and hydrophilicity were also calculated for Nsp13 (figure 3).

208

Chou and Fasman's beta-turn prediction algorithm (with threshold 0.984) resulted in a

209

minimum score of 0.677 and a maximum score of 1.384, and our selected peptide showed a

210

propensity score of 1.164 (figure 3A). Emini surface accessibility prediction tool (with

211

threshold 1.000) resulted in a minimum score of 0.036 and a maximum score of 4.888, and

212

our selected peptide scored 1.33 in surface accessibility (figure 3B). Karplus and Schulz's

213

flexibility prediction tool (with threshold 0.989) resulted in a minimum score of 0.904 and a

214

maximum score of 1.150, and our selected peptide showed 1.033 in flexibility score (figure

215

3C). Kolaskar and Tongaonkar antigenicity scale (with threshold 1.052) resulted in a

216

minimum score of 0.893 and a maximum score of 1.284, and our selected peptide showed

217

an antigenicity score of 1.0163 (figure 3D). The parker hydrophilicity prediction algorithms

218

(with threshold 1.325) resulted in a minimum score of -3.714 and a maximum score of 7.000,

219

and our selected peptide showed 1.33 in hydrophilicity score (figure 3E).

222

The IEDB webserver tool was used for prediction of Cytotoxic T- Lymphocyte epitopes and

223

its interaction with MHC class I molecules. Our analysis with Nsp13 revealed 8 potential T

224

cell epitopes (table 2). NetMHCpanEL 4.1 MHC-class I binding prediction tools was used to

225

predict the binding of these epitopes with MHC class I molecules with high affinity are listed

226

in table 2. The peptides FAIGLALYY from start (11) to end (19) had highest immunogenicity

227

and affinity to interact with 9 alleles (HLA-B*35:01, HLA-A*26:01, HLA-B*53:01, HLA-

228

A*01:01, HLA-A*30:02, HLA-B*58:01, HLA-B*15:01, HLA-A*68:01, HLA-B*57:01) and also

229

showed allergenicity (table 2). The allergenicity of these epitopes was predicted by Allergen

230

FP tool, which categorises peptides into allergen/non-allergen based on the Tanimoto

231

coefficients.

232

Similarly, the prediction of Helper T-Lymphocyte epitopes of Nsp13 and its interaction with

233

MHC Class II molecules was predicted by IEDB webserver (based on IEDB recommended

234

2.22 method). We selected top 6 epitopes that exhibited maximum binding affinity with MHC

235

class II molecules (table 3). Our analysis revealed that only one epitope (HKLVLSVNP)

236

possesses both antigenicity and allergenicity properties and affinity to interact with 5 alleles

237

as shown in table 3 (HLA-DRB1*15:01, HLA-DRB1*03:01, HLA-DRB1*07:01, HLA-

238

DRB3*01:01, HLA-DRB5*01:01). The epitopes EHYVRITGL had highest immunogenicity

239

and affinity to interact with 4 alleles (HLA-DRB5*01:01, HLA-DRB1*15:01, HLA-DRB4*01:01,

240

HLA-DRB1*07:01) (table 3). The allergenicity of these epitopes were also predicted based

241

on Tanimoto coefficients.

242
243

Physiochemical profiling of promising T-cell epitopes

244

To substantiate our data, we examined several vital physiochemical features of the

245

promising T cell epitopes. The half-life of MHC class I and II epitopes were calculated and

246

our data revealed that the maximum half-life was observed for HVISTSHKL (MHC class I)

247

and ETFKLSYGI exhibited for MHC class II molecule (table 4). The toxicity prediction was

248

performed by ToxinPred tool show that all analysed molecules were non-toxic (table 4). We

249

further analysed hydrophobicity, hydropathicity, hydrophilicity, polarity, charge, flexibility, pI,

250

molecular weight and surface accessibility of both MHC class I and II molecules (table 4).

251
252

The secondary structure prediction revealed several mutations that might lead to structural

253

change of Nsp13.

254

To understand the effect of mutation on Nsp13 protein, we performed secondary structure

255

prediction by CFFSP webserver. This prediction tool identifies the variation in secondary

256

structure contributed by the mutant residue. Our data revealed that out of 27 mutations, only

257

12 show alterations in secondary structure (figure 4). The minor variations were observed at

258

positions E142V, H164Y, G206V, T214I, S259T, R392C, P419S, and R499L (figure 4A-D,

259

G, I, J and K). S236I and A237T mutation lead to replacement of helical structure into beta-

260

sheet (figure 4E and F). The coiled coil and turn structure were shifted to helix and beta-

261

sheet in P300L and P504L mutants (figure 4H and L).

262
263

Protein disorder predictions due to Mutations in Nsp13 protein

264

Disordered regions (DRs) are defined as entire proteins or regions of proteins that lack a

265

fixed tertiary structure. Alteration of amino acid sequences in polypeptide chain due to the

266

mutation might causes change in protein disorder. Here, we used PONDR-VSL2 webserver

267

to measure the protein disorder of those mutants that showed alteration in secondary

268

structure. Our analysis revealed that ten mutations E142V, H164Y, S166A, E168A, G206V,

269

G206C, T214I, S236I, R392C and P504L (figure- 5A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, J and K)

270

decreased the protein disorder, while two mutations Y253H and I545M (figure- 5I and L) led

271

to increase in protein disorder. Altogether, our data revealed alteration in protein disorder

272

due to the mutation in Nsp13 of SARS-CoV-2.

273
274

Mutations cause alteration in dynamic stability of Nsp13.

275

We used DynaMut program to predict the effect of mutations on the stability of the protein

276

and calculated the differences in free energy (ΔΔG) between wild type and mutants. The

277

positive

278

decrease in stability. Our analysed data revealed the noticeable increase or decrease in free

279

energy in various mutations as shown in table 5. The maximum positive

280

for H164Y (0.974 kcal/mol) and the maximum negative

281

1.694kcal/mol) (table 5). Similarly, we also measured the change in vibrational entropy

282

energy (ΔΔSVibENCoM) between the wild type and the mutants. The highest positive

283

ΔΔSVibENCoM was Obtained for P53S (0.504kcal.mol-1.K-1) and negative ΔΔSVibENCoM

284

was obtained for P419S (-0.661 kcal.mol-1.K-1) (table 5). Altogether, the data obtained from

285

ΔΔG and ΔΔSVibENCoM suggests that the mutations identified in this study can influence

286

Nsp13 protein stability and dynamicity.

ΔΔG

DISCUSSIONS

289

In this study, we examined the physiochemical characteristics of the Nsp13, a non-structural

290

protein of SARS-CoV-2. We studied the high rank B cell and T cell epitope candidates based

291

on the immune-informatics tools to identify Nsp13 epitopes that could regulate host immune

292

responses. The immunoinformatics approaches have been used to study the epitopes from

293

several viruses and those information’s were used to understand the immune response of

294

viruses [34,35]. We used several physiological parameters including structural protrusion,

295

antigenicity, flexibility, surface accessibility, hydrophilicity of Nsp13 were assessed to predict

296

potential B-cell epitopes. IEDB resource tool was used to predict B-cell linear epitopes of at

297

least eight amino acid residues. Our analysis revealed that under these conditions, seven

298

linear B-cell epitopes were predicted that are at least 8 amino acids in length and are of non-

299

toxic. The discontinuous epitopes comprised of the residues that might be separated in

300

linear sequence, however, in 3D structure they are in close proximity [36]. Subsequently, the

301

candidate epitopes were further characterised by the tools that can predict various

302

physicochemical

303

‘TFEKGDYGDA’ peptide exhibited a strong stable immunogenic property as shown by its

304

highest vaxijen score (.9707) and non-toxic. Furthermore, eight MHC class-I and six MHC

305

class-II binding T-cell epitopes assessed as highly antigenic and also predicted to interact

306

with several HLA alleles. Detailed analysis revealed that the best vaxijen score of 1.18 was

307

found for ‘FAIGLALYY’ peptide for MHC class-I moelcule, and for MHC class-II molecules,

308

‘HKLVLSVNP’ has a maximum vaxijen score of 0.50 epitopes.

309

It has been well established that the replication of coronaviruses are error-prone that lead to

310

creation of highly diverse genotype variants. Our study revealed a considerable alteration in

311

stability and dynamicity due to mutations at various positions of Nsp13 that might alter its

312

function. In-silico analyses were performed to identify and characterise the mutations

313

occurring in Nsp13. Our data demonstrate that seven of the identified mutations reside in

314

those epitopes that include P53, G54, S100, Y205, G206, H245 and V247 positions (figure

315

2), which can help the SARS-CoV-2 variants to elicit distinct immune response compared to

316

the wild-type SARS-CoV-2. Among these G206V also led to alteration in secondary structure

317

(figure 4) and protein disorder parameters (figure 5). This proposed consequence due to

318

variations in Nsp13 epitopes are substantiated by several findings with similar observations

319

[37–39]. In short, these results could provide some insights in the understanding of Nsp13

320

epitopes, which is essential for evaluating the immunogenicity and virulence of SARS-CoV-
