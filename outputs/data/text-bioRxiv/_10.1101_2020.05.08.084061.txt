ABSTRACT

15

The emergence of a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, resulted in a pandemic. Here, we used recently

16

released X-ray structures of human ACE2 bound to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike

17

protein (S) from SARS-CoV-2 to predict its binding to ACE2 proteins from different animals, including

18

pets, farm animals, and putative intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2. Comparing the interaction sites of

19

ACE2 proteins known to serve or not serve as receptor allows to define residues important for binding.

20

From the 20 amino acids in ACE2 that contact S up to seven can be replaced and ACE2 can still function

21

as the SARS-CoV-2 receptor. These variable amino acids are clustered at certain positions, mostly at

22

the periphery of the binding site, while changes of the invariable residues prevent S-binding or

23

infection of the respective animal. Some ACE2 proteins even tolerate the loss or the acquisition of N-

24

glycosylation sites located near the S-interface. Of note, pigs and dogs which are not or not effectively

25

infected, respectively, have only a few changes in the binding site have relatively low levels of ACE2 in

26

the respiratory tract. Comparison of the RBD of S of SARS-CoV-2 with viruses from bat and pangolin

27

revealed that the latter contains only one substitution, whereas the bat virus exhibits five. However,

28

ACE2 of pangolin exhibit seven changes relative to human ACE2, a similar number of substitutions is

29

present in ACE2 of bats, raccoon, and civet suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may not especially adapted to

30

ACE2 of any of its putative intermediate hosts. These analyses provide new insight into the receptor

31

usage and animal source/origin of SARS-COV-2.

32

IMPORTANCE

33

SARS-CoV-2 is threatening people worldwide and there are no drugs or vaccines available to mitigate

34

its spread. The origin of the virus is still unclear and whether pets and livestock can be infected and

35

transmit SARS-CoV-2 are important and unknown scientific questions. Effective binding to the host

36

receptor ACE2 is the first prerequisite for infection of cells and determines the host range. Our analysis

37

provides a framework for the prediction of potential hosts of SARS-CoV-2. We found that ACE2 from

38

species known to support SARS-CoV-2 infection tolerate many amino acid changes indicating that the

39

species barrier might be low. However, the lower expression of ACE2 in the upper respiratory tract of

40

some pets and livestock means more research and monitoring should be done to explore the animal

41

source of infection and the risk of potential cross-species transmission. Finally, the analysis also

42

showed that SARS-CoV-2 may not specifically adapted to any of its putative intermediate hosts.

INTRODUCTION

45

As of the 30th of April 2020, the ongoing pandemic of a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory

46

syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has developed into a global challenge with the number of total

47

confirmed cases exceeding 3 million including more than 200 thousands fatalities, thereby causing a

48

major loss to global public health and the world economy. This disease is referred to as the 2019

49

coronavirus disease (COVID-19) by World Health Organization (WHO) and was defined as a public

50

health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) on the 30th of January 2020. Its main clinical

51

symptoms include fever, fatigue, and dry cough. A rather large proportion of patients become critically

52

ill with acute respiratory distress syndrome, similar to patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome

53

(SARS) caused by SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (1-3). SARS emerged in China in 2002-2003 and also

54

rapidly spread worldwide but was contained by public health measures. It is thought that bats and

55

palm civets are the natural and intermediate reservoirs of SARS-CoV (4, 5). Likewise, research suggests

56

that SARS-CoV-2 might have originated also from bats and that pangolins might be the potential

57

intermediate host (6-9). Specifically, SARS-CoV-2 has a high nucleotide sequence identity with Bat-CoV-

58

RaTG13-like virus except for the middle part of its genome encoding the spike protein which might

59

have derived via recombination from a Pangolin-CoV-like virus (6, 7, 10-12). A previous study showed

60

that SARS-CoV-2 replicates poorly in dogs, pigs, but cats are permissive to infection (13). However,

61

whether pets can become new hosts of SARS-CoV-2 needs to be clarified further.

62

The structure of the trimeric spike protein (S) of SARS-CoV-2, the major factor that determines cell and

63

host tropism, has been determined (14-17). It is cleaved by host proteases into the S1 subunit, which

64

contains the receptor binding domain (RBD), and S2, which mediates fusion of the virion with cellular

65

membranes (18). Proteolytical cleavage of S at two sites (S1/S2 and S2´) is required to prime the

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.08.084061; this version posted May 8, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

66

protein to execute its fusion activity. Cleavage is performed by the serine transmembrane protease

67

TMPRSS2, but in its absence lysosomal cathepsin proteases B and L can substitute (19). S of SARS-CoV-

68

2 contains an insertion of four amino acids that creates a cleavage site for the ubiquitous protease

69

furin (16, 20, 21).

70

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) belongs to the angiotensin-converting enzyme family of

71

dipeptidyl carboxyl dipeptidase and has considerable homology with human angiotensin-converting

72

enzyme 1. SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV share the same membrane protein, angiotensin converting

73

enzyme 2 (ACE2), as the cellular receptor (16, 22). In this study, we used a comparative bioinformatics

74

and structural approach to better understand the source and host range of emerging SARS-CoV-2. We

75

compared recently released X-ray structures of human ACE2 bound to the receptor-binding domain of

76

S from SARS-CoV-2 with the structure of S of SARS-CoV bound to human ACE2 (23-26). Using ACE2

77

sequences of species that can serve and not serve as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 we propose amino

78

acids crucial for binding (12). We report that pets (cats) and domestic animals are at risk of infection

79

with SARS-CoV-2 since they have fewer amino acid changes at the ACE2-S interface compared with

80

ACE2 proteins from animals that are known to serve as the SARS-CoV-2 receptor. In China, Europe, and

81

other countries, pets have long accompanied humans and thus they may be a neglected source worthy

82

of further research. In addition, using RBD sequences of putative intermediate hosts, we consider

83

which of them is more likely to bind to human ACE2. We also compared O- and N-glycosylation sites

84

and a putative integrin binding motif in the S proteins of these viruses.

85

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

86

Interacting amino acids of human ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV S proteins

87

Three crystal structures of the receptor-binding domain of S from SARS-CoV-2 in a complex with its

88

receptor, human ACE2, has been resolved recently (24-26). The protein interaction surface (pdb-file

89

6MOJ) is depicted in Fig. 1A (26). A total of 17 residues in the spike protein are in contact with 20 amino

90

acids in ACE2, eight of which (labelled in orange) form hydrogen bonds with 13 residues in S (see also

91

Table 1). The other interactions are mostly hydrophobic involving many tyrosine residues in the viral

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.08.084061; this version posted May 8, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

92

spike. A substantial part of the binding energy might be provided by the formation of a salt bridge

93

between a negatively charged Asp30 in ACE2 with a positively charged Lys417 in the spike protein,

94

which is located in the middle of the interaction surface.

95

A second crystal structure (pdb file 6LZG) identified one more contact site: Ser19 in ACE2 interacts with

96

Ala457 and Gly458. Ser19 is the first amino acid in ACE2 of all crystals and hence its side chain might

97

be more flexible (24). The third crystal structure (pdb-file 6VW1) identified three more sites, Leu45,

98

Gln325, and Glu329, that were identified in the two other papers to be unique for binding to S of SARS-

99

CoV, but not the salt bridge involving Asp30 (25). However, the authors used a chimeric S protein that

100

contains the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV plus the loop that maintains a salt bridge between

101

Arg426 with Glu329 in ACE2 (see below). Thus, this chimeric spike might not display the authentic

102

binding properties of SARS-CoV-2.

103

It was reported in some studies that S of SARS-CoV-2 binds with higher affinity to its receptor than S

104

of SARS-CoV (14, 16, 24, 27). Wang et al. (2020) and Lan et al. (2020) identified more amino acids in

105

SARS-CoV-2 compared with SARS-CoV interacting with ACE2 that also form more hydrogen bonds and

106

van-der-Waal contacts (24, 26). To visualize the amino acids involved in binding of both S proteins we

107

used the crystal structure of S from SARS-CoV bound to human ACE2 (23). The contact surface of S is

108

formed by a similar number of residues (16) which interact with 20 amino acids in ACE2, but three of

109

the latter residues are unique for binding to S of SARS-CoV (Fig. 1B, labelled in cyan, and Table 1).

110

Surprisingly, two of the unique residues (Gln325, Glu329) are involved in the formation of the only salt

111

bridge with Arg426 in S, which is located at the periphery of the binding site. The side chain of Asp30,

112

that forms the salt bridge with SARS-CoV-2 S, is pointing away from the interacting surface and is thus

113

not available for binding. In summary, although most of residues in ACE2 involved in binding to S of

114

SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV are identical, some are unique suggesting that coronaviruses can adapt in

115

multiple ways to the human ACE2 receptor.

Comparison of the interacting surface of ACE2 proteins that serve and not serve as SARS-CoV-2

receptor

118

It has been shown that transfection of HeLa cells with genes encoding the human, pig, civet, and bat

119

ACE2 receptor makes them susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2, but not with ACE2 from mice

120

(12). To estimate which of the interacting amino acids in ACE2 are essential for binding of S, we

121

compared the ACE2 sequences from humans with that from the other species. Table 1 shows the

122

amino acids that make contacts with S from both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV (red numbers), only with

123

S from SARS-CoV (blue numbers), only with S from SARS-CoV-2 (green numbers) as well as some

124

variable amino acids in the vicinity (black numbers), and some encoding N-glycosylation sites

125

(highlighted in grey).

126

Pig ACE2 contains five amino acid substitutions in the interacting surface with S from SARS-CoV-2

127

relative to human ACE2 (Fig. 2A). Three of the exchanges are located at the periphery of the binding

128

site. Leu79 and Met82, which interact with Phe486 in S, are conservatively substituted by Ile and Thr,

129

respectively. Gln24, which forms a hydrogen bond to N487 in S, is replaced by Leu, which cannot form

130

hydrogen bonds. His34 in the centre of the binding site is also substituted by a Leu residue, which is

131

larger, but cannot from a hydrogen bond. Furthermore, Asp30, which forms the central salt bridge, is

132

exchanged by a Glu residue. Since Glu is also negatively charged, the salt bridge to Lys417 most likely

133

remains intact. It might even become stronger since the side chain of Glu is larger and hence the

134

distance between negatively and positively charged residues becomes smaller. In addition, the N-

135

glycosylation site Asn90 in human ACE2 is destroyed by an exchange to Thr.

136

Three amino acid sequences of the ACE2 gene from the bat species Rhinolophus sinicus (R. sinicus) are

137

present in the database. The bats were sampled from R. sinicus colonies in three Chinese provinces

138

including, Guangxi (R. S. -GX), Hubei (R. S. -HB), and Yunnan (R. S. -YN) (28, 29). Strikingly, although

139

their overall amino acid identity is very high (99%), they exhibit large amino acid differences in the N-

140

terminal amino acids that contact the S protein (Table 1). Since the accession number of the bat ACE2

141

is not specified in the publication that demonstrates that it confers susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2

142

infection, it is presently unclear which of them is recognized by the viral spike protein (12). In any case,

143

bat ACE2 proteins contain at least five changes relative to human ACE2. Three of them are substituted

144

in all bat ACE2 sequences and involve the same residues as in pig ACE2, but they are replaced by other

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.08.084061; this version posted May 8, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

145

amino acids. Gln24 is replaced by the negatively charged Glu or by a positively charged Arg; His34 is

146

substituted by Thr or Ser; and Met82 is substituted by an Asn. In one bat sequence (R. S. -YN) the next

147

but one Pro residue 84 is also replaced by a Ser, which creates a new N-glycosylation site (NXS) at

148

position 82. In addition, in two bat sequences (R. S. -YN and R. S. -GX) Thr27 is substituted by Met or

149

Iso and Tyr41, which forms a hydrogen bond with Thr500 in S, is replaced by the smaller His residue.

150

The most drastic substitution in these two bat ACE2 sequences is Glu35, which forms a hydrogen bond

151

with Gln493 in S, by a positively charged Lys residue. The ACE2 sequence obtained from a bat in the

152

Hubei province, which exhibits the most amino acid substitutions relative to the two other ones, does

153

not contain the latter three changes, but instead Arg31 is replaced by a negatively charged Glu and

154

Asp38 by Asn. The reason why bats exhibit so many changes in residues that interact with S is striking

155

and requires further investigation. However, it is tempting to speculate that local co-evolution

156

between bats and coronaviruses drive these amino acid changes.

157

To get further insight into the amino acids not essential for binding to S, we analysed the ACE2 from

158

civets (Paguma larvata) that has been shown to serve as receptor for SARS-CoV-2 (12). Civet ACE2

159

contains seven amino acid changes relative to human ACE2 (Fig. 2B). Three of them (Gln24Leu,

160

Asp30Glu, and Met82Thr) are identical to the substitutions in pig ACE2. Another (His34) is at the same

161

position, but exchanged to a different amino acid, Tyr instead of Leu. Another unique, but conservative

162

substitution, Leu45V, is located at the periphery of the binding site, whereas the other three are in the

163

centre. Asp38Glu is a conservative change, but K31T and E37Q replace a charged by an uncharged

164

amino acid.

165

Mouse ACE2, which does not support infection of cells with SARS-CoV-2, has eight amino acid

166

substitutions in the interacting surface with S of SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 2C). Three of the sites, Gln24, His34,

167

and Met82 are also replaced in the ACE2 proteins from the two other species and are thus unlikely to

168

be the decisive elements that prevent binding. Leu79 interacts with Phe486 in S (Fig. 6A) and is

169

exchanged by a Thr. In contrast to bat ACE2, the substitution at position 82 does not create a N-

170

glycosylation site in mouse ACE2 since it is exchanged to Ser. Note also that the two used N-

171

glycosylation sites near the interacting surface in human ACE2, Asn322, and Asn90, are lost in mouse

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.08.084061; this version posted May 8, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

172

ACE2 due to exchanges of the Asn residues. The other four exchanges Asp30Asn, Tyr83Phe, Lys31Asn,

173

and Lys353His are more important for preventing binding to mouse ACE2 as discussed in more detail

174

below.

175

In summary, binding of S of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 proteins tolerates a surprisingly large number of

176

amino acid changes in the interaction surface, five in pig ACE2 and seven in civet ACE2. Even the

177

acquisition of an additional N-glycosylation site at position 82 due to two substitutions in bat ACE2

178

(M82N, P84S) does not prevent SARS-CoV-2 to use bat ACE2 as receptor in transfected cells. This is in

179

contrast to binding of S of SARS-CoV to rat ACE2, where a glycan attached to the same position

180

prevents binding (23).

181

Comparison of the interacting surface of human ACE2 and ACE2 from pet animals

182

Next, we asked whether receptor binding might present a species barrier for infection of pets with

183

SARS-CoV-2. Dog ACE2 contains five amino acid changes in the amino acids in contact with S (Fig. 3A).

184

Residues 24, 30, 34, and 82 are also replaced in pig ACE2, even to the same amino acid at four of the

185

sites. A unique change in dog ACE2 is Asp38Glu, but since this is a conservative change it is unlikely to

186

affect the binding properties of S. Like in pigs, dog ACE2 lacks the glycosylation site at position 90.

187

Asn90 is replaced by Asp in dogs, but to Thr in pigs. Note that the sequence of dog ACE2 in the database

188

contains a non-conservative exchange at position 329 (Glu to Gly), which contacts the S protein of

189

SARS-CoV. This exchange is not present in the ACE2 from a beagle that we sequenced (accession

190

number MT269670).

191

Cat ACE2 contains only four changes (Gln24Leu, Asp30Glu, Asp38Glu, Met82Thr), which are also

192

present in dog ACE2 (Table 1). For the first time, we analysed the ability of ACE2 proteins from pigs,

193

dogs and cats binding to S and submitted this manuscript on 27th of March. During the review process,

194

results of infection experiments with animals in close contact with humans were posted at 31th of

195

March (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.30.015347v1.full.pdf), and it showed that

196

SARS-CoV-2 replicates poorly in dogs, but efficiently in cats and was transmitted by droplets to naïve

197

cats that ACE2 is linked to the fact (13). This indicated that S binding to ACE2 receptors is only the first

198

step in the virus's invasion, and ACE2 levels in different tissues may play an important role in viral

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.08.084061; this version posted May 8, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

199

transmission. Therefore, the risk of infection in animals requires continuous monitoring. The only

200

residue in dogs, which is not changed in cat ACE2 is His34, which interacts with Tyr453, Leu455, and

201

Gln493 in the centre of the interaction surface. It is exchanged by the slightly later Tyr residue in dog

202

ACE2, which is still able to interact with the same residues in S (Fig. 3A, inset). The other difference is

203

the loop of the N-glycosylation site at position 90.

204

There is also anecdotal evidence that tigers and lions in the Bronx Zoo of New York City were infected

205

by SARS-CoV-2 (https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/newsroom/news/sa_by_date/sa-2020/ny-zoo-

206

covid-19). Therefore, we analysed the ACE2 gene from these wild cats. One amino acid difference was

207

detected in ACE2 from cat and tiger, but the residues contacting S are identical explaining why tigers

208

are also susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. ACE2 from a lion has another conservative change

209

relative to cat ACE2: His34 is substituted by Ser and it exhibits a loss of the N-glycosylation site at

210

position 90, like dog ACE2.

211

Comparison of the surface of human ACE2 and ACE2 from species suitable as animal models

212

Exploring potential therapies for COVID-19 animal models is urgently needed. Recent study showed

213

that ferrets to be highly susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2 and even transmit virus to naïve

214

contact animals, but also by droplets, albeit the latter route was less efficient (13, 30). Ferret ACE2

215

exhibits the exact same five changes as dog ACE2, but also a substitution of Leu79 by His. In addition,

216

a drastic change occurs at position 354, where the small glycine residue is replaced by a large and

217

positively charged Arg residue (Fig. 3B). However, the Arg residue avoids clashing with large amino

218

acids in S (Tyr505) by protruding backwards (Fig. 3B, inset).

219

The Syrian hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) is also shown to be susceptible to experimental infection

220

and transmitted SARS-CoV-2 to close contact animals (31). Its ACE2 protein contains only two amino

221

acid substitutions relative to human ACE2. His34 is exchanged to Gln and Met82 is replaced by Asn.

222

Since residue 84 is also exchanged to a Ser, it creates a N-glycosylation site at position 82. A glycan

223

attached to the same position prevents binding of S of SARS to rat ACE2.

224

Guinea pig (Cavia porcellus) might also serve as an animal model, but also common pets, especially of

225

children. Guinea pig ACE2 contains seven amino acid changes at positions 24, 27, 31, 34, 38, 82, and

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.08.084061; this version posted May 8, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

226

354 and thus more than ACE2 from ferrets or dogs. The glycosylation site at position 90 is preserved,

227

but the site at position 322 is lost due to an Asn to Pro change (Table 1).

228

Comparison of the interacting surface of human ACE2 and ACE2 from farm animals

229

Farm animals are also in close contact with humans and thus represent another risk group that might

230

become infected by SARS-CoV-2. The ACE2 proteins from chicken contain ten amino acid changes

231

compared with human ACE2 and lost the N-glycosylation site at position 90 (Fig. 3C). Some of the

232

affected positions (Gln24, His34, Leu79, Met82, and Gly 353) are also exchanged in ACE2 proteins that

233

serve as SARS-CoV-2 receptor, albeit often to different residues. Unique to all ACE2 proteins is the

234

change of Gln24 by the negatively charged Glu residue, but the interaction with Gly446 and Tyr449 in

235

S is probably preserved (Fig 3C, inset). Most of the other exchanges are likely to be more critical for

236

binding to S. Tyr at position 83 is replaced by a Phe, which is not able to form a hydrogen bond with S.

237

Two of the changes reverse the polarity of a charged amino acid: Lys31 is substituted by a negatively

238

charged Glu and Glu35 is exchanged to a positively charged Arg. Finally, Asp30, which forms the salt

239

bridge with S, is replaced by the uncharged residue Ala, which makes the ACE2 proteins from chicken

240

and mice the only ones that are not able to form a salt bridge with S.

241

Duck ACE2 also contains ten amino acid substitutions, nine of them at the same position and eight to

242

the same amino, including all the presumably important ones just discussed. Thus, it seems likely that

243

the lack of susceptibility of chicken and ducks to experimental SARS-CoV-2 is due to the inability of the

244

virus to bind to the avian ACE2 receptor (13).

245

The ACE2 protein of pigs can serve as SARS-CoV-2 receptor although it contains five amino acid changes

246

in amino acids contacting the S protein (Fig. 2A). Cattle and sheep contain only two amino acid changes

247

(Asp30Glu and Met82Thr) that are also present in pig ACE2 and even retain the N-glycosylation site at

248

position 90 of human ACE2 that is lost in pig ACE2. It thus seems highly likely that ACE2 proteins of

249

both species can function as SARS-CoV-2 receptor and experimental infection of these animals and

250

surveillance is required to show whether they are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. Camel is the animal

251

reservoir of the Middle East Respiratory syndrome virus (MERS), which however uses dipeptidyl-

252

peptidase 4 as protein receptor. We analysed the ACE2 gene from Camelus bactrianus and found,

253

besides the two changes present in cattle and sheep, another substitution: the positively charged Lys31

254

located at the center of the binding site is exchanged by a negatively charged Glu residue, a change

255

which is also present in guinea pig.

256

In summary, almost all mammalian species known to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection (cats and

257

ferrets) have mutations in many amino acids in their ACE2 proteins. This suggests that these species,

258

especially those in contact with humans, are at risk of contracting the virus and SARS-CoV-2 might

259

establish itself in one of these animals thereby creating an additional animal reservoir. An exception is

260

apparently the pig, which cannot be infected with SARS-CoV-2, although their ACE2 protein can

261

function as SARS-CoV-2 receptor (12). In addition, dogs do not transmit the virus to naïve animals in

262

close contact. We therefore investigated the level of ACE2 expression in different organs by q-RT-PCR.

263

We found that pigs and dogs have the highest mRNA levels in kidney, but the level is also high in other

264

internal organs, such as heart (pigs and dogs) and duodenum and liver (pigs) (Fig. 4). The relative mRNA

265

levels in tissues relevant for SARS-CoV-2 infection, lung, trachea and turbinate are very low, 1,000-fold

266

(dogs) or 10,000-fold (pigs) lower than in kidney. Among these organs, pigs exhibit the highest mRNA

267

levels in trachea, around 20-fold less in lungs and very little in turbinates. In dogs the mRNA level is

268

around 20-fold higher in lungs compared with the trachea, no mRNA was detected in turbinates. It is

269

thus tempting to speculate that the low ACE2 levels in the respiratory tract prevent infection of pigs

270

and the efficient replication and hence spread of the virus to contact animals in dogs. However,

271

efficient receptor binding is only the first step in virus infection. Beyond that, numerous restriction

272

factors have been identified in cells from various species that prevent successful virus replication. Our

273

results mean more experiments and monitoring should be done to explore the source of animal

274

infection.

275

Amino acids in ACE2 essential for binding of SARS-CoV-2

276

Based on an amino acid comparison of ACE2 proteins from animals that do not serve as SARS-CoV-2

277

receptor (mice) or are not susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection (chicken) with ACE2 proteins from

278

animals which are infectable (cats, dogs, ferrets) or encode a ACE2 protein that confers susceptibility

279

to SARS-CoV-2 infection (civet), the amino acids essential for binding of S can be deduced (Fig 5, Table

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.08.084061; this version posted May 8, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

280

1). Tyr83, which forms hydrogen bonds with Asn487 and Tyr489 in S, is replaced by Phe in mice and

281

duck. Phe has the same size and hydrophobicity but is not able to form hydrogen bonds with its side

282

chain. All other animals exhibit at position 83 a Tyr residue. Note, however, that Tyr489 might be

283

shielded by the acquisition of an N-glycosylation site at position 82 as it occurs in ACE2 of mice and in

284

some bat sequences. The other residues are located in the center of the interaction surface. Lys31,

285

which forms van-der-Waals contacts with Y489 and F456 is exchanged by a neutral Asn reside in mice

286

and even to a negatively charged Glu in chicken. Glu35 forms hydrogen bonds with Gln493 in S. It is

287

replaced by a positively charged Arg in chicken, ducks, and some bat sequences. Lys353, which forms

288

hydrogen bonds with its side chain to Tyr495, Gly496, and Gly502, is replaced by the smaller His residue

289

in mice, which presumably cannot form these hydrogen bonds. ACE2 of all other animals (including

290

chicken) contain a Lys at this position. In support of this hypothesis, a single Lys353Ala mutation was

291

shown to abolish the ACE-S interaction (32). Finally, also important is the centrally located Asp30,

292

which is substituted by Asn in mice and chicken. Asn has the same size as Asp, but is uncharged and

293

thus unable to sustain the salt bridge with Lys417 in S. ACE2 proteins from all other animals either

294

retain Asp or it is substituted by the negatively charged, but slightly larger Glu residue, which is

295

probably also able to from the salt bridge.

296

Note that positions 330, 355, and 357 are conserved through all ACE2 proteins we analyzed here and

297

thus their relevance for binding to S cannot be estimated (Table 1). In addition, binding of S to ACE2

298

might not follow a simple “lock-and-key” principle. The mouse-adapted SARS-CoV strain MA15

299

contains a single amino acid exchange in the S protein relative to the Urbani strain; Tyr at position 346

300

is replaced by a His residue (33). Tyr 346 forms hydrogen bonds with Asp38 and Gln42 in human ACE2

301

(Fig. 1B), but mouse ACE2 also contains Asp and Gln at positions 38 and 42, respectively. His is also

302

able to serve as hydrogen-bond donor or acceptor, but its side chain is shorter, and it is not obvious

303

how this exchange enhances binding to mouse ACE2.

304

Comparison of amino acids in the RBM of SARS-CoV-2 with bat and pangolin coronavirus

305

It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 derived from a bat virus, but parts of the S protein exhibit a

306

higher nucleotide similarity to a virus from pangolin. Therefore, we aligned the whole amino acid

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.08.084061; this version posted May 8, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

307

sequence of S from SARS-CoV-2 (first Wuhan isolate) with sequences from the bat and the pangolin

308

virus (Supplementary Fig. 1). As noted before, S from SARS-CoV-2 contains an insertion of four amino

309

acids (PRRA) that creates a polybasic cleavage site recognized by the ubiquitous protease furin (20, 32).

310

Insertion of amino acids at the S1/S2 junction can occur also in bats, since the novel bat-derived virus

311

RmYN02 contains the insertion of amino acid PAA, which does not create a polybasic cleavage site (34).

312

The following S2 subunit is almost completely conserved among all three viruses, it exhibits nine mostly

313

conservative amino acid substitutions in S of the pangolin virus, and only two in S of the bat virus. The

314

N-terminus of the S protein until residue 400 is also highly similar between S of SARS-CoV-2 and the

315

bat virus. There are only six amino acid exchanges in the bat virus, two of them affecting N-

316

glycosylation sites, whereas S from the pangolin virus contains 101 amino acid differences compared

317

with S of SARS-CoV-2 (Supplementary Fig. 1). However, from residue 401 to 518, which contains the

318

receptor binding domain of S, the homology reverses (Table 2).

319

The bat virus contains 18 amino acid substitutions, five of them involve amino acids that contact

320

human ACE2 (white sticks in Fig. 6A). Located at the periphery of the interaction surface is Phe486,

321

which interacts with Leu79 in ACE2. It is replaced by a Leu, that is also a large and hydrophobic residue.

322

At the other side of the interaction surface located is Asn501, which forms a hydrogen bond with Tyr41

323

in ACE2 and is replaced by the negatively charged Glu residue. The other three exchanged amino acids

324

are located in the centre of the ACE2 binding site. Gln493, which forms a hydrogen bond with Glu35,

325

is replaced by a Tyr residue. Tyr449, which forms a hydrogen bond with Gln42, is replaced by Phe,

326

which has the same size, but cannot form (or only weak) hydrogen bonds. The most drastic exchange

327

is probably Tyr505, which forms a hydrogen bond with Gln42 and is exchanged by a much smaller His

328

residue.

329

In contrast, S from the pangolin virus contains only three exchanges relative to SARS-CoV-2, and only

330

one of them involves an amino acid that contacts ACE2, the substitution of Lys 417 by an Arg (red stick

331

in Fig. 6A). Since both are basic amino acids, the important salt bridge is probably preserved. In

332

summary, the RBD from the pangolin coronavirus is much better suited to bind to human ACE2

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.08.084061; this version posted May 8, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

333

compared to the bat virus. From this point of view, it seems possible that SARS-CoV-2 might have

334

acquired the RBD from a pangolin coronavirus to achieve bat-to-human transmission.

335

Comparison of the interacting surface of ACE2 proteins of putative intermediate hosts

336

We therefore asked whether ACE2 of pangolin (Manis javanica) contains amino acids in its interaction

337

surface that might closely resemble those of humans. In that case, a precursor of SARS-CoV-2 acquired

338

a RBD from a pangolin virus by recombination which is then already adapted to replicate both in

339

pangolins and in humans. However, pangolin ACE2 contains seven changes compared with human

340

ACE2 (Fig. 6B). In addition, the N-glycosylation site at position 322 of human ACE2 is lost due to an

341

change of Asn to Lys. Some of the changes, Asp30Glu, His34Ser, Asp38Glu, and Leu79Ile, occur also in

342

ACE2 proteins from animals that can interact with S. The three other variable positions are also

343

exchanged in other animals, but mostly to other residues. Gly354 is replaced by a small His residue and

344

not by the larger Arg, that is present in ferret ACE2. Gln24, which interacts with Asn 487 in S, is replaced

345

by a negatively charged Glu residue. Finally, Met82, that interacts with Phe486 in S, is replaced by the

346

larger Asn residue. Although none of the amino acid changes might prevent binding to S, it

347

nevertheless appears that pangolin ACE2 is not especially equipped to serve as receptor for SARS-CoV-

348

2.

349

Other potential intermediate hosts are civets and raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides). ACE2 of

350

civets has been shown to confer susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection in cell culture, although it

351

contains seven changes relative to human ACE2 in the amino acids contacting S (Fig. 2B). The ACE2

352

protein from racoons contains only five substitutions, Gln24Leu, Asp30Glu, His34Tyr, Asp38Glu, and

353

Met82Thr, which are also present in civet ACE2. It is also identical in these residues to ACE2 from dogs,

354

which are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection but do not spread the virus.

355

In summary, none of ACE2 proteins of any of the discussed intermediate hosts seems to be especially

356

equipped to attach to S of SARS-CoV-2, but the least number of changes occur in ACE2 of racoon dogs.

357

Glycosylation sites and a putative integrin binding motif in S proteins from SARS-CoV-2 and bat and

358

pangolin virus

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.08.084061; this version posted May 8, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

359

It has previously been shown that a RGD motif (403–405: Arg-Gly-Asp) is present in the receptor-

360

binding domain of the spike proteins of all SARS-CoV-2 sequences (35). This sequence mediates

361

attachment of several viruses to integrins, which thus might serve as an additional receptor for SARS-

362

CoV-2. Two RGD motifs are present in S of pangolin CoV, one at the same site, another at amino acids

363

246-249, but S of bat coronavirus (RaTG13) contains no RGD motif (Fig. 7A).

364

Bulky carbohydrates attached to the S protein might mask antibody epitopes, interfere with receptor

365

binding and/or with proteolytical cleavage that is required to prime the protein to execute its

366

membrane fusion activity. S of SARS-CoV-2 contains 22 N-glycosylation sites (NXS/T), nine in S2 and 13

367

in the S1 subunit, which are all glycosylated with almost 100% stoichiometry if the ectodomain of S is

368

expressed in mammalian cells (36).

369

A total of 21 glycosylation sites are conserved among all three viruses. S of SARS-CoV-2 contains a

370

unique glycosylation site in the N-terminal domain at position 74 in a loop of the N-terminal S1 domain

371

(Fig. 7B). This region (aa 60-80) is dissimilar to the pangolin virus, but identical to S of the bat virus,

372

except the glycosylation site (NGI). Two sites are present only in S of the bat and pangolin coronavirus,

373

but not in SARS-CoV-2. One is also located in the N-terminal domain at position 30, in a region (aa 15-

374

49) which is identical to S of SARS-CoV-2 virus, except the glycosylation sequon, which is NSS in S of

375

bat, but NSF in S of SARS-CoV-2. The N-terminal domain has a galectin-like folding and is known in

376

other coronaviruses to bind to carbohydrates on the cell surface, i. e. using them as an attachment

377

factor as the first step of virus entry (17). Most interestingly is a site at position 370 which localizes

378

near the ACE2 receptor binding domain. This residue is located in a region (aa 275- 400) of high amino

379

acid identity among all three viruses. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that this site was lost during

380

adaption of SARS-CoV-2 to humans, in order to get better access to the ACE2 receptor.

381

As suggested before, the insertion of amino acids at the cleavage site between the S1/S2 subunits of

382

SARS-CoV 2 creates three potential GalNAc O-glycosylation sites, which are not predicted for S of the

383

bat or pangolin virus (37). Attachment of GalNac to serine and threonine residues is catalysed by up to

384

20 different Gal-Nac transferases having different, partially overlapping substrate specificities. The

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.08.084061; this version posted May 8, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

385

sugar residues are then elongated by other glycosyltransferases thereby creating long carbohydrate

386

chains. Interestingly, whether a certain O-glycoslyation site is used is cell-type dependent and O-

387

glycans attached near furin cleavage site have been shown to affect processing (38, 39). It is thus

388

tempting to speculate that the usage of an O-glycosylation site might determine whether S is cleaved

389

in a certain cell. Since processing by furin is essential for entry of SARS-CoV-2 into cells that lack

390

cathepsin proteases, O-glycosylation might affect cell tropism and hence virulence of SARS-CoV-2 (40).

391

This is somewhat reminiscent of hemagglutinin (HA) of an avian Influenza A virus where the loss of a

392

N-glycosylation sequon near a polybasic cleavage site allowed processing of HA thereby generating a

393

highly virulent strain (41).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

395

Sequence analysis

396

The S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and bat coronavirus RaTG13 were obtained from GenBank (accession

397

numbers QHD43416.1 and QHR63300.2, respectively). The pangolin coronavirus nucleotide sequence

398

was obtained from GISAID (EPI_ISL_410721) and translated into protein. Sequences were aligned using

399

MEGA7.0. A total of 23 ACE2 protein sequences of 20 mammal including human, dog, cat, guinea pig,

400

hamster, mouse, pig, rabbit, cattle. sheep, ferret, raccoon dog, bat (Rhinolophus sinicus), civet,

401

pangolin, tiger, lion, camel, chicken and duck were download from GenBank. The ACE2 protein

402

sequences of dog (MT269670) and cat (MT269670) were obtained from this study (Table 1). All the

403

sequences were aligned using MEGA7.0.

404

Structural analysis

405

The software PyMol was used to create the figures of the Cryo-EM structure of S from SARS-CoV-2

406

(pdb file 6VSB) and from the crystal structure of its receptor-binding domain bound to human ACE2

407

(pdb file 6M0J). The amino acids which are mentioned in this publication to mediate contact between

408

S and ACE2 are shown as sticks, whereas the remainder of the molecules are shown as cartoons. The

409

integrated measuring wizard was used to determine the distance between two atoms, which is shown

410

as dotted lines also indicating the distance in Angström. Exchange of certain amino acids was

performed with the mutagenesis tool. Among the different possible rotamers of the mutated amino

412

acid side chain the one was chosen that exhibits no clashes with neighboring amino acids.

413

Sample collection and nucleic acid extraction

414

Sample collection and processing were done at the Institute of Military Veterinary Medicine and

415

Nanjing Agricultural University for animal welfare. All the experiments were approved by the

416

committee on the ethics of animal experiments. Samples of dog and pig including heart, liver, spleen,

417

lung, kidney, duodenum, bronchus and turbinate, were used for quantitative real-time PCR (q-RT-PCR)

418

to determine the content of mRNA encoding ACE2. The kidney of a beagle or Felis catus were used for

419

PCR amplification of the full length of ACE2. A total of 50 mg of each sample was ground into powder

420

in liquid nitrogen and transferred to DEPC treated EP tube before liquid nitrogen volatilizes. Total RNA

421

was extracted using 1 mL TRIzol (Nanjing Vazyme biotechnology), and 1 μg cDNA was synthesized using

Figure legends

590

Fig. 1 (A) Interaction surface of SARS-CoV-2 S (green) and human ACE2 (blue). Amino acids involved in

591

contact are shown in magenta (S) or in ACE2 in orange (amino acids forming hydrogen bonds) and cyan

592

(hydrophobic interaction) sticks. D30 forms a salt bridge with K417 in S of SARS-CoV-2. The figure was

593

created with PyMol from pdb file 6MOJ. (B) Interaction surface between SARS-CoV S (green) and

594

human ACE2 (blue). Amino acids making the contacts are shown in magenta (S) or orange (ACE2) sticks.

595

The three amino acids in ACE2 that are not involved in binding of S from SARS-CoV-2 are shown in cyan

596

sticks. The side chain of D30 that forms a salt bridge with S of SARS-CoV-2 is pointing away from the

597

interacting surface. Inset: Detail of the interaction between R426 that forms a salt bridge with E329

598

and a hydrogen bond with Q325. The figure was created with PyMol from pdb file 2AJF.

599

Fig. 2 (A) Amino acid changes of human ACE2 and pigs ACE2. Amino acid changes in ACE2 from pigs

600

compared with human ACE2 are highlighted in red. N90 is not an interaction site, but the change N90T

601

destroys the N-glycosylation site present in human ACE2. (B) Amino acid changes of human ACE2 and

602

civet ACE2. Amino acid changes in ACE2 from civet compared with human ACE2 are highlighted in red.

603

(C) Amino acid changes of human and mouse ACE2. Amino acid changes in human ACE2 compared

604

with mouse ACE2 are highlighted in red. P84 in human ACE2 does not interact with amino acids in S of

605

SARS-CoV-2 but might affect the secondary structure. N90T and N322H destroy the N-glycosylation

606

site in human ACE2.

607

Fig. 3 (A) Amino acid changes between human ACE2 and dog ACE2. (B) Amino acid changes between

608

human ACE2 and ferret ACE2.

609

Fig. 4 The relative expression of ACE2 in (A) pig and (B) dog tissues was determined by q-RT-PCR. (A)

610

The relative expression of ACE2 in pig was determined in heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, duodenum,

611

trachea, turbinate bone, and stomach. (B)The relative expression of ACE2 in dog was determined in

612

heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, trachea, and turbinate bone. The experiments were repeated three

613

times.

614

Fig. 5 Amino acids in ACE2 important for binding to S of SARS-CoV-2. Y83 forms hydrogen bonds to

615

N487 and Y489, which are probably weakened by the conservative change to F. K353 forms hydrogen

616

bonds to G502, G496, and Y495, the latter two are probably destroyed by the change to His and the

617

interacting amino acid changes between human and mouse ACE2. Amino acid changes in human ACE2

618

compared with mouse ACE2 are highlighted in red. P84 in human ACE does not interact with amino

619

acids in S of SARS-CoV-2 but might affect the secondary structure. N90T and N 322H destroy the N-

620

glycosylation site in human ACE2.

621

Fig. 6 (A) Amino acid changes in the RBD of S from SARS-CoV-2 and viruses from bats (white sticks) and

622

pangolin (red stick). Hydrogen bonds between S from SARS-CoV-2 and the corresponding amino acids

623

in ACE2, which are likely to be weakened or destroyed by the changes, are shown as dotted lines. (B)

624

Amino acid changes between human ACE2 and pangolin ACE2.

625

Fig. 7 Distribution of glycosylation sites and RGD motifs in the S from SARS-CoV-2, bat and pangolin

626

CoV. (A) Schematic representation of SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein. The sequences of SARS-CoV-2, bat and

627

pangolin coronavirus were aligned using MegAlign. The RGD motif is highlighted in red. The RBM

628

starting position is highlighted in blue. (B) Cryo-EM structure of S from SARS-CoV-2 (14). N-

629

glycosylation sites unique for SARS-CoV-2, bat and/or pangolin virus are highlighted as red or orange

630

spheres. The amino acid sequences RGD present in S of SARS-CoV-2 and the pangolin virus is labeled

631

as cyan sphere. In a monomer in the open conformation it is located near the ACE2 binding sites on

632

top of the molecule. The location of the RGD motif in a monomer in a closed conformation (grey) is

633

also indicated. The location of the furin cleavage site present only in S of SARS-CoV-2 and of the

634

S2´cleavage site is also highlighted as red spheres.
