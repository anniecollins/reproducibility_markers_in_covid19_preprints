ABSTRACT
A newly identified coronavirus, named SARS-CoV-2, emerged in December 2019 in Hubei Province, China,
and quickly spread throughout the world; so far, it has caused more than 18 million cases of disease and
700,000 deaths. The diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is currently based on the detection of viral RNA in
nasopharyngeal swabs by means of molecular-based assays, such as real-time RT-PCR. Furthermore,
serological assays aimed at detecting different classes of antibodies constitute the best surveillance strategy
for gathering information on the humoral immune response to infection and the spread of the virus through
the population, in order to evaluate the immunogenicity of novel future vaccines and medicines for the
treatment and prevention of COVID-19 disease. The aim of this study was to determine SARS-CoV-2-specific
antibodies in human serum samples by means of different commercial and in-house ELISA kits, in order to
evaluate and compare their results first with one another and then with those yielded by functional assays
using wild-type virus. It is important to know the level of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM, IgG and IgA antibodies in
order to predict population immunity and possible cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses and to identify
potentially infectious subjects. In addition, in a small sub-group of samples, we performed a subtyping
Immunoglobulin G ELISA. Our data showed an excellent statistical correlation between the neutralization
titer and the IgG, IgM and IgA ELISA response against the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein,
confirming that antibodies against this portion of the virus spike protein are highly neutralizing and that the
ELISA Receptor-Binding Domain-based assay can be used as a valid surrogate for the neutralization assay in
laboratories which do not have Biosecurity level-3 facilities.

INTRODUCTION
Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped, positive single-stranded RNA viruses belonging to the Coronaviridae
family. Several members of this family, such as human coronavirus (HCoV) OC43, NL63 and 229E, cause mild
common colds every year in the human population [1]. Three highly pathogenic novel CoVs have appeared
in the last 18 years; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV-1) emerged in November 2002 in
Guangdong province, causing more than 8,000 confirmed cases and 774 deaths [2], [3], Middle East
Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) was discovered in June 2012 [4], and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, in December 2019; this last was
declared a pandemic on March 11th 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO). The global impact of the
SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, with almost 18 million cases and 700,000 deaths reported (as of August 7th 2020) [5],
is unprecedented. Several data have confirmed that the infection initially arose from contact with animals in
the Hunan seafood market. Subsequently, human-to-human transmission occurred, leading to a very high
rate of laboratory-confirmed infection in China [6], [7]. Precise diagnosis of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
is essential in order to promptly identify infected individuals, to limit the spread of the virus and to allow
those who have been infected to be treated in the early phases of the infection. To date, real-time
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the most widely employed method of diagnosing COVID-19. However,
rapid, large-scale testing has been prevented by the high volume of demand and the shortage of the materials
needed for mucosal sampling [8]. Standardized serological assays able to measure in a specific manner the
antibody responses may help to overcome these problems and may support a significant number of relevant
applications. Indeed, serological assays are the basis on which to establish the rate of infection (severe, mild
and asymptomatic) in a given area, to calculate the percentage of the population susceptible to the virus and
to determine the fatality rate of the disease. It has been demonstrated in a non-human primate model [9]
that, once the antibody response has been established, re-infection and, consequently, viral shedding, is
unlikely. Furthermore, serological assays can help to identify subjects with strong antibody responses, who
could serve as donors for the generation of monoclonal antibody therapeutics [10]; in addition, these assays
can be used to define future correlates of protection for SARS-CoV-2. The spike glycoprotein (S-protein), a
large transmembrane homotrimer of approximately 140kDa, has a pivotal role in viral pathogenesis,
mediating binding to target cells through the interaction between its receptor-binding domain (RBD) [11] and
the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. The S-protein has been found to be highly
immunogenic, and the RBD is considered the main target in the effort to elicit potent neutralizing antibodies
[12], [13]. Two subunits give rise to the S-protein: S1, which mediates attachment, and S2, which mediates
membrane fusion. The CoV S-protein is a class I fusion protein, and protease cleavage is required for
activation of the fusion process [14].
Few data documenting the differences in systemic immunoglobulin G (IgG) and their subclasses, IgM and IgA,
in terms of their responses against SARS-CoV-2, are as yet available, especially data comparing these
responses with the neutralizing one. It is well recognized that IgG levels are crucial to protection from viral
disease [15]. In humans, the four subclasses of IgG (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4) differ in function [16]. Importantly,
IgG1 and IgG3 play a key role in many fundamental immunological functions, including virus neutralization,
opsonization and complement fixation [17].
We conducted this comparative study for two purposes: first, to investigate the sensitivity and specificity of
detection of different ELISA kits compared with Micro-Neutralization (MN) results; second, to investigate the
difference in spike-RBD-specific IgG, IgM and IgA antibody responses in human serum samples.

RESULTS

Set-up and standardization of in-house ELISAs
Several purified recombinant S-proteins (S1 and RBD domain) were tested for their ability to detect specific
human antibodies: S1-SARS-CoV-2 (HEK293) (from Native Antigen); S1-SARS-CoV-2 (HEK293) (from
eEnzyme); S1-SARS-CoV-2 (HEK293) (from ACROBiosystems); Spike RBD-SARS-CoV-2 (Baculovirus-Insect and
HEK293) (from Sino Biological). Each protein was evaluated on using three coating concentrations (1, 2 and
3 µg/mL) and four different dilutions of the secondary Horse Radish Peroxidase (HRP) conjugate anti-human
IgG, IgM and IgA antibodies. We also evaluated the impact of the incubation time of the HRP by incubating
the plates for 1 hour or 30 minutes, and concluded that the best and clearest signal was always seen after
the shortest incubation. To set the assays, three human serum samples derived from convalescent donors,
along with a pool of Micro Neutralization Titres (MNT) and ELISA (commercial Kit)-negative human serum
samples, were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. As a test control, human IgG1 monoclonal
antibody (mAb) anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike (S1) (CR3022 Native antigen), human IgM mAb anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike
(S1) (CR3022 Absolute antibody) and human IgG1 anti-Spike RBD (SCV2-RBD eEnzyme) were used.
Additionally, several human sera hyper-immune to various infectious diseases (influenza, diphtheria and
pertussis) were used to assess the specificity of the assay in detecting only antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 S1
or the RBD protein. Alternative blocking/diluent solutions containing 1% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA), 2.5%
milk and 5% milk were tested. The specificity of the test increased significantly on using the 5% milk blocking
solution in comparison with BSA, which occasionally yielded non-specific results and displayed a generally
higher background. Finally, the two proteins that yielded the best results in terms of sensitivity and specificity
were chosen as candidates for the tests: the purified S1-protein (HEK derived) from eEnzyme and the Purified
RBD protein (HEK derived) from Sino Biological.

Correlation between ELISAs and Neutralization
Each serum sample was tested by means of in-house ELISA S1 and RBD-specific IgG, IgM and IgA (VM_IgG_S1,
VM_IgG_RBD, VM_IgM_S1, VM_IgM_RBD, VM_IgA_RBD) and by means of the Euroimmun S1 Commercial
ELISA kit, along with the functional MNT assay. The distribution of the MNT was strongly asymmetric, with
most of the values (153/181) being equal to 5 (i.e. negative). The other values observed (from 10 to 1280 in
a 2-fold dilution series) were uniformly distributed. Concerning the ELISA S1, we performed two different
tests: one by means of a commercial (Euroimmun) kit and the other an in-house ELISA. According to
Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients and statistical significance (Tables 1 and 2), we registered the
highest agreement between the ELISA VM_IgG_RBD and MNT, and between the VM_IgA_RBD and MNT, with
coefficients of 0.83 and 0.85, respectively. The lowest correlations were found for ELISA Euroimmun vs MNT,
and for VM_IgG_S1 vs MNT, with coefficients of 0.49 and 0.45, respectively. As can be seen from the
correlation plot (Figure 1), the IgA response was closely linked with a positive MNT response. Moreover, on
dissecting all the results for each serum sample (data not shown), we noted that, in those subjects in whom
we registered a high neutralization titer, we always observed a positive IgA signal.
Interestingly, in 9 MNT-positive samples, we found a complete absence of S1 signal on using Euroimmun,
VM_IgG_S1 and VM_IgM_S1 ELISA kits but, on the other hand, high and detectable IgG and IgM RBD-specific
signals.

Classification analysis: Elastic Net
Over a training set of data, the optimal hyper-parameters estimated for the Elastic Net (EN) model were
lambda=0.0136 and alpha=0.76, which minimized the error of cross-validation (= 0.3809). The EN model
selected three significant predictors of the MNT results, namely VM-IgG-RBD, VM-IgM-RBD, and VM-IgARBD; the estimates of their coefficients were 0.0035, 0.0060 and 0.0013, respectively, while the intercept of
the model was -2.9741. These results were entered into the score function, whereby we predicted the MN
titers. From the ROC curve (Figure 2A), we evaluated the performance of the predictions in terms of
sensitivity and specificity. On balancing sensitivity and specificity, we obtained the optimal cut-off of 0.092,
with sensitivity = 85.7 % (95% CI = [42.1% – 99.6%]) and specificity = 98.1% (95% CI = [89.9% – 99.6%]) (Figure
2B). Overall, these findings indicated that the Vismederi RBD-based ELISA methods were highly accurate and,
particularly, presented the features of a highly specific diagnostic test when jointly considered.

The samples which yielded a score below the cut-off identified were classified as “negative”, and the
remaining samples as “positive”. We then compared these predictions with the known results of the test-set
(Figure 2C).
Analysis of the error matrix indicated an overall Accuracy (ACC) of 96.7% (95% CI = [88.5% – 99.6%]), and a
No Information Rate (NIR) of 88.3% (95% CI = [77.4% – 95.2%]). Since the ACC was significantly higher than
the NIR (p = 0.02), we may claim that the model built with the In-house (VM) RBD-based ELISAs conveyed
effective information. The extremely high value of the odds ratio (OR) = 312.0, (95% CI = [17.2 – 5657.7])
revealed the strong association between the MNT results and the model predictions. Specifically, the positive
predictions were 312 times more likely to occur in association with positive MNT than the negative
predictions.
IgG subtyping of serum samples
We also evaluated the ELISA IgG subtyping response (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4) in a small subgroup (14) of MNpositive samples. ELISA plates were coated with RBD purified antigen. Our results, although derived from a
small group of subjects, are in line with previous findings by Amanat and colleagues [18]. Strong reactivity
for IgG1 and IgG3 was found in almost all samples, with the IgG3 subclass showing the highest percentage of
detection. Low and very low reactivity was found for IgG4 and IgG3, respectively (Figure 3).

DISCUSSION
Like most of the emerging infectious diseases that affect humans, this new HCoV also originated from animals
[19], [20]. Owing to the rapid increase in some human practices, such as deforestation, urbanization and the
husbandry of wild animal species, over the years the emergence of new pathogens has become an extremely
serious problem. The rapid global spread of the novel SARS-CoV-2 is posing a serious health threat to the
entire world. There is now an urgent need for well-standardized serological assays that can detect different
classes of antibodies against the novel coronavirus, and which can be used alongside the classical diagnostic
molecular methods (RT-PCT). Indeed, owing to the huge demand in recent months, the availability of the
reagents and equipment needed to promptly carry out analyses is still inadequate. Moreover, if sample
collection and storage are improperly conducted, molecular tests may yield false-negative results in subjects
who carry the virus [21]. Previous studies on SARS-CoV-1 have shown that virus-specific IgG (and IgM) levels
can be a valid surrogate for serological diagnosis [22], [23]. Indeed, the present study had two major goals:
a) to standardize and make as reliable as possible ELISAs able to detect different classes of immunoglobulins,
and b) to broaden the data-set of information on comparisons between the results of different serological
tests, which could be precious for future evaluations of serological diagnoses and vaccine assessments [24].

Specifically, in this study, ELISA results were always compared with those of the functional assay (MN), which
is commonly assumed as a benchmark and the gold standard. Since its first isolation and characterization,
this new HCoV strain has been classified, according to the WHO guidelines, as a biosafety level 3 (BSL3)
pathogen. This has placed some limits on the implementation of neutralization tests, as relatively few
laboratories have level-3 biocontainment facilities. The ELISAs are a good surrogate for the MN assay in terms
of sensitivity, safety and throughput [25]–[27]. However, it is very important to evaluate and estimate the
best antigen/s to use in these platforms in order to obtain a reliable and similar response to that of the
neutralization test, which indicates the functional response. This is why we compared all our results with
those of the MN. As in the case of influenza hemagglutinin [28], antibodies specific to the RBD domain of
the S-protein are the key to viral neutralization. In this study, together with the IgG, IgM and IgA analyses,
we also evaluated the responses of IgG subclasses in those subjects who showed both a high RBD ELISA signal
and proven neutralization activity. Our results are in line with previous findings [18] and confirm IgG1 and
IgG3 as the subtypes with the strongest reactivity in all samples [29]. Only in a small number of subjects did
we find IgG2 and IgG4 responses. IgG1 and IgG3 are involved in critical immunologic functions, such as
neutralization, opsonization, complement fixation and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). On
the other hand, IgG2 plays an important role in protecting against infection by encapsulated microorganisms
[30]; IgG4 is generally a minor component of the total immunoglobulin response and is induced in response
to continuous antigenic stimulation [31, p. 4].
Regarding the ELISA IgG, IgM and IgA, the main results can be summarized as follows: a) all the proposed
statistical analyses indicated a close relationship between the results of MNT and in-house RBD-based ELISAs,
namely VM-IgG-RBD, VM-IgM-RBD and VM-IgA-RBD; these results are in line with previous reports by
Amanat and colleagues [18], [32]; b) the cross-validation technique applied to the EN model allowed us to
obtain robust results. In the out-of-sample data (i.e., the randomly chosen test-data) highly accurate, and,
particularly, highly specific performance was observed; c) in large-scale screening operations, it is very
important to have a highly specific test, as this guards against the risk of misclassification of true-negative
samples with a wide margin of certainty. A highly specific test is particularly useful in order to confirm a
diagnosis already made by means of other methods, and when a false-positive result would have a great
impact. Indeed, a highly specific test is of most help to the clinician when it provides a positive result.
An overview of all the results yielded by ELISA and MNT (data not shown) reveals that the highest
neutralization activity against SARS-CoV-2 is achieved when all three immunoglobulins, IgG, IgM and IgA are
detected, as if to indicate the presence of a synergistic or additive effect among different classes of
antibodies. This observation can be explained by the fact that the human population is completely naïve for
SARS-CoV-2 and that IgG or IgM alone is not able to mount an ideal neutralizing immune response. Indeed,
one of the most important features of adaptive immunity is the generation of immunological memory and
the ability of the immune system to learn from its experiences of encounters with the same pathogen,
thereby becoming more effective over time [33].
Interestingly, in nine samples, neither in-house nor commercial kits detected any IgG and IgM signal for the
S1 protein, while a strong signal for RBD-specific IgG, IgM and IgA was detected. As all nine samples displayed
exactly same trend, it seems that these results could be due to the folding of the three-dimensional S1 protein
structure after the production in HEK293 cells, which could have masked some epitopes recognized by the
antibodies expressed in these nine subjects. By contrast, these epitopes may be well exposed in the RBD
protein and can be bound by antibodies, which would explain the differences in signals.
To conclude, these results confirm what has already been reported [34], i.e. that the immune response to
SARS-CoV-2 is very variable, but that antibodies targeting the RBD domain have the highest probability of
being neutralizing, and in some cases of being strongly neutralizing. The present study constitutes preliminary
research into the development of an ELISA that can semi-quantify anti-SARS-CoV-2 human antibodies in a
specific and repeatable way. The next step will be to completely validate these ELISAs according to the criteria
established by the International Council for Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals
for Human Use [35, p. 2], and to analyze the performance and specificity of these tests with specific human
serum samples that are highly positive towards different HCoVs.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Serum samples
In March/April 2020, 181 human serum samples were collected by the laboratory of Molecular Epidemiology
of the University of Siena, Italy. The samples were anonymously collected in compliance with Italian ethics
law.
Three human serum samples from confirmed cases of COVID-19 were kindly provided by Prof. Valentina
Bollati from the University of Milan. Human IgG1 anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S1) Antibody CR3022 (Native
Antigen, place), Human IgM anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S1) Antibody CR3022 (Native Antigen, Oxford, UK) and
anti-Spike RBD (SARS-CoV-2/COVID 19) human monoclonal antibody (eEnzyme, Gaithersburg, USA) were
used as positive controls in ELISA. Human serum minus (IgA/IgM/IgG) (Cod. S5393, Sigma, St. Louis, USA) was
also used as a negative control in MNT and ELISA.
Three human serum samples containing heterologous neutralizing antibodies, provided by NIBSC, were used
to verify the specificity of the ELISA: WHO 1st International Standard for Pertussis antiserum (lot. 06/140);
WHO 2nd International Standard for antibody to influenza H1N1pdm virus (lot. 10/202); WHO 1st International
Standard for Diphtheria Antitoxin (lot: 10/262).
Cell Culture
Vero E6 cells, acquired from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC - CRL 1586), were cultured in
Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) - High Glucose (Euroclone, Pero, Italy) supplemented with 2
mM L- Glutamine (Lonza, Milan, Italy), 100 units/mL penicillin-streptomycin mixture (Lonza, Milan, Italy) and
10% of Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), at 37°C, in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator.
VERO E6 cells were seeded in a 96-well plate using D-MEM high glucose 2% FBS at a density of 1.5 x 106cells
per well, in order to obtain a 70-80% sub-confluent cell monolayer after 24 hours.
SARS-CoV-2 purified antigen, live virus and titration:
Five different purified recombinant S proteins (S1 and RBD domain) were tested for their ability to detect
specific human antibodies: S1-SARS-CoV-2 (HEK293) Cod. REC31806-500, (Native Antigen, Oxford, UK); S1SARS-CoV-2 (HEK293) Cod. SCV2-S1-150P (eEnzyme Gaithersburg, MD, USA); S1-SARS-CoV-2 (HEK293) Cod.
S1N-C52H3 (ACROBiosystems, Newark, DE, USA); Spike RBD-SARS-CoV-2 (Baculovirus-Insect cells) Cod.
40592-V08B and (HEK293) Cod. 40592-V08H (Sino Biological, Beijing, China).
SARS CoV-2 - strain 2019-nCov/Italy-INMI1 – wild-type virus was purchased from the European Virus Archive
Global (EVAg, Spallanzani Institute, Rome). The virus was titrated in serial 1-log dilutions to obtain a 50%
tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) on 96-well culture plates of VERO E6 cells. The plates were observed
daily for the presence of cytopathic effect (CPE) by means of an inverted optical microscope for a total of 4
days. The end-point titers were calculated according to the Spearman-Karber formula [36].
Micro-neutralization assay:
The MNT was performed as previously reported by Manenti et al. [37]. Briefly, 2-fold serial dilutions of heatinactivated serum samples were mixed with an equal volume of viral solution containing 100 TCID50 of SARSCoV-2. The serum-virus mixture was incubated for 1 hour at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2.
After incubation, 100 µl of the mixture at each dilution was passed to a 96-well cell plate containing a 7080% confluent VERO E6 monolayer. The plates were incubated for 3 days at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere

with 5% CO2. After the incubation time, each well was inspected by means of an inverted optical microscope
to evaluate the percentage of CPE. The highest serum dilution that protected more than 50% of cells from
CPE was taken as the neutralization titer.

Commercial Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA):
Specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were detected by means of two commercial ELISA kits: Euroimmun
and Eagle Biosciences.
Euroimmun-ELISA plates were coated with recombinant structural protein (S1 domain) of SARS-CoV-2. The
assay provides semi-quantitative results by calculating the ratio of the optical density (OD) of the serum
sample over the OD of the calibrator. According to the manufacturer’s instructions, positive samples have a
ratio ≥ 1.1, borderline samples a ratio between 0.8 and 1.1 and negative samples a ratio < 0.8.

In-House S1 and RBD Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) IgG, IgM and IgA:
ELISA plates were coated with 1µg/mL of purified recombinant Spike S1 Protein (aa 18-676) (eEnzyme,
Gaithersburg, MD, USA) or with 1µg/mL Spike-RBD (Arg319-Phe541) (Sino Biological, China), both expressed
and purified from HEK 293 cells. After overnight incubation at +4°C, coated plates were washed three times
with 300 µl/well of ELISA washing solution containing Tris Buffered Saline (TBS)-0.05% Tween 20, then
blocked for 1 hour at 37°C with a solution of TBS containing 5% of Non-Fat Dry Milk (NFDM; Euroclone, Pero,
Italy).
Serum samples were heat-inactivated at 56°C for 1 hour in order to reduce the risk of the presence of live
virus in the sample. Subsequently, 3-fold serial dilutions, starting from 1:100 in TBS-0.05% Tween 20 5%
NFDM, were performed up to 1:2700. Plates were washed three times, as previously; then 100 µl of each
serial dilution was added to the coated plates by means of a multichannel pipette and incubated for 1 hour
at 37°C. Next, after the washing step, 100 µl/well of Goat anti-Human IgG-Fc HRP-conjugated antibody or
IgM (µ-chain) and IgA (α- chain) diluted 1:100,000 or 1:100,000 and 1:75,000, respectively, (Bethyl
Laboratories, Montgomery USA) were added. Plates were incubated at 37°C for 30 minutes. Following
incubation, plates were washed and 100 µl/well of 3,3′,5,5′-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate (Bethyl
Laboratories, Montgomery, USA) was added and incubated in the dark at room temperature for 20 minutes.
The reaction was stopped by adding 100 µl of ELISA stop solution (Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, USA)
and read within 20 minutes at 450 nm. To evaluate the OD a SpectraMax ELISA plate reader was used.
A cut-off value was established as 3 times the average of OD values from blank wells (background: no addition
of analyte).
Samples with ODs below the cut-off value at the first (1:100) dilution were assigned as negative, samples
with titres between 100 and 300 were assigned as positive, and samples showing a titer above 300 were
assigned as highly positive.

In-House RBD Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4:
An indirect ELISA was performed in order to determine the RBD-specific IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4 antibody
concentration in serum samples [38]. 96-well plates were coated with 1µg/mL of purified Spike-RBD (Sino
Biologicals). Serum samples were diluted from 1:50 to 1:400. Mouse anti-human IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4
Fc-HRP (Southern Biotech, USA) secondary antibodies were used at 1:8000 dilution. The cut-off values were
established as reported above.

Statistical analysis
Spearman’s rank correlation analysis enabled us to determine whether, and to what extent, the MNT assay
was associated with the ELISAs. A classification analysis gave further insight into the relationship between
the MNT results and the in-house ELISAs. We defined the MN as the target variable and recoded its results
by assigning the label “0” to values of 5, and the label “1” otherwise. We implemented an elastic net (EN) to
classify the MNT results. The EN is a rather sophisticated generalized linear model (GLM), which addresses
the issues caused by multi-collinearity among predictors. We set the binomial family for the GLM after
dichotomizing the variable MNT; therefore, we followed a logistic-like model approach in the implementation
of the EN. The EN produces a selection of the variables based on a convex penalty function, which is a
combination of the ridge regression and the LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator)
penalties, say l1 and l2 respectively, controlled by the hyper-parameter alpha = l2/(l1+l2). The hyperparameter, lambda, by contrast, regulates the level of penalization in the model [39]. To improve the
generalization capability of the EN, we trained the model over a randomly selected subset of data (121/181)
and verified its robustness over an independent subset of the residual data (60/181), which did not enter the
model during the training stage. The cross-validation technique prevented the occurrence of over-fitting
problems in the estimates. On the base of the values of the predictors of the test set, X, and their estimated
EN coefficients, b, we built a score function, S, as follows:
𝑆(𝑋, 𝑏) = 𝑒 𝑋∙𝑏
The probability of a positive MNT assignment for the predicted results was then expressed as:
𝑃(𝑀𝑁𝑇 = Positive ) =

𝑆(𝑋, 𝑏)
(1 + 𝑆(𝑋, 𝑏))

We calculated the performance of the EN in terms of sensitivity, i.e., the percentage of positive MNT correctly
predicted, and specificity, i.e., the percentage of negative MNT correctly predicted, and represented their
related Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. The optimal combination of sensitivity and specificity
enabled us to detect the cut-off in the score function; test samples were classified as positive if their score
was above this cut-off value and as negative if the score was below it, with the minimum error probability.

Figure 1. The correlation plot associated to the measured coefficients of Spearman’s rank correlation. The
magnitude of the coefficients is represented by circles and a color gradient: the larger the area of the circle
and the more intense the tone of the color, the greater the correlation. The direction of the correlation is
indicated by the color scale: blue tones for positive correlations and red tones for negative correlations.

Figure 2. A) Analysis of the ROC curve referred to the test set proved that the results of the EN model attained
high accuracy in predicting the MNT values. Measurement of the area under the curve, AUC = 90.7 %,
supported this conclusion; B) Summary table of ROC analysis; C) Error matrix.
