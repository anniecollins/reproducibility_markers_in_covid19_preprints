ABSTRACT
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19). The rapid, sensitive and specific diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 by fast and
unambiguous testing is widely recognized to be critical in responding the current outbreak. Since the
current testing capacity by conventional PCR based methods is insufficient because of shortages of
supplies such as RNA extraction kits and PCR reagents, alternative and/or complementary testing
assays should be developed. Here, we exploit the potential of targeted mass spectrometry based
proteomic technologies to solve the current issue of insufficient SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing
capacity. We have assessed the limit of detection by parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) on an
Orbitrap Eclipse mass spectrometer for target tryptic peptides of several SARS-CoV-2 proteins from a
sample of virus infected Vero cells. For Nucleocapsid protein the limit of detection was found to be
in the mid-attomole range (0.9 x 10-12 g), which would theoretically correspond to approximately
10,000 SARS-CoV-2 particles, under the assumption that all viral proteins are assembled in
macromolecular virus particles. Whether or not this sensitivity is sufficient to play a role in SARSCoV-2 detection in patient material such as swabs or body fluids largely depends on the amount of
viral proteins present in such samples and is subject of further research. If yes, mass spectrometry
based methods could serve as a complementary protein based diagnostic tool and further steps
should be focused on sample preparation protocols and on improvements in sample throughput.

INTRODUCTION
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is a severe respiratory disease 1. The virus is contagious in humans
and the World Health Organization (WHO) has designated the ongoing pandemic of COVID-19 a
Public Health Emergency of International Concern 2. As of now, over 176,000 deaths have been
reported worldwide and this is probably an underestimation because of lack of testing capacity in
large parts of the world.
SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus. A viral genome organization analysis
revealed the following genes (from 5′ to 3′): replicase ORF1ab, spike (S), envelope (E), membrane
(M) and nucleocapsid (N). The predicted replicase ORF1ab gene contains 16 predicted non-structural
proteins by (at least) 13 downstream ORFs 3.
Tests provide rapid and unambiguous evidence of viral infection and further treatment is usually
based on the outcome of such tests. Importantly, the reduction of time required to identify SARSCoV-2 infections will significantly contribute to limiting the enormous social and economic
consequences of this large global society paralyzing outbreak. Thus, the rapid, sensitive and specific
diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 is widely recognized to be critical in responding to this outbreak, but also
for long-term improvements in patient care. Conventional methods for diagnostic testing of viral
infections, which are also widely used for SARS-CoV-2 testing, are based on polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) or other (multiplexed) nucleic-acid based technologies. Since its emergence late 2019
it has become clear that additional diagnostic tools that target SARS-CoV-2 should be developed to
complement existing tools in a “proactive approach” proposed by the Coronaviridae Study Group of
the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses) 1. Alternative and/or complementary SARSCoV-2-specific diagnostic tests are desperately needed since the current testing capacity is
insufficient, amongst others because of shortages of supplies such as RNA extraction kits, PCR
reagents and delivery issues for primers and probes, etc. In addition, additional testing assays are
helpful in research to better understand the biological activity and potential of the virus.
Besides PCR based approaches, immunoassays have been employed in the detection of other
viruses. In addition, mass spectrometry (MS) based techniques have been applied, for instance to
detect influenza virus proteins 4 and human metapneumovirus (HMPV) in clinical samples 5. Recent
developments in and targeted proteomics methods and Orbitrap mass spectrometry such as parallel
reaction monitoring (PRM) have shown a substantial sensitivity increase for over the past years.
Although mass spectrometry based approaches have been used in a few SARS-CoV-2 studies recently
(David E. Gordon et al, 2020; Davidson et al., 2020; Ihling et al., 2020; Shen et al., 2020) it is not yet
clear whether state-of-the-art proteomics technologies could provide the sensitivity and specificity
needed in diagnostics.
Here, we exploit the potential of mass spectrometry based proteomics technology to solve the issue
of insufficient SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing capacity. For this, we first assess the limit of detection
by PRM on an Orbitrap Eclipse for specific tryptic peptides of SARS-CoV-2 proteins. The sensitivity
was found to be in the mid-attomole range (~0.9 pg) for Nucleocapsid (NCAP), which is the most
abundant viral protein and therefore the most likely target candidate for tests. A rough calculation
indicates that this level of sensitivity should be sufficient to detect protein amounts theoretically
corresponding to approximately 10,000 SARS-CoV-2 particles. Obviously, whether or not this
sensitivity is sufficient to play a role in SARS-CoV-2 detection in patient material such as swabs,
mucus and other body fluids, largely depends on the amount of viral proteins present in such

samples. If yes, subsequent steps should be focused on sample preparation protocols that are in
agreement with validated virus inactivation procedures and on improvements in sample throughput.
Finally, providing novel mass spectrometry based diagnostic tools that complement genomic
approaches is also the major goal of the recently formed COVID-19 mass spectrometry coalition
(www.covid19-msc.org). The aim of this ‘proof-of-concept’ study is to highlight the potential of mass
spectrometry in identifying SARS-CoV-2 proteins for diagnostics and research.

METHODS
Virus sample
Vero E6 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Gibco) supplemented
with 10 % fetal calf serum (FCS), HEPES, sodium bicarbonate, penicillin (10,000 IU/mL) and
streptomycin (10,000 IU/mL) at 37 °C in a humidified CO2 incubator. SARS-CoV-2 (isolate
BetaCoV/Munich/BavPat1/2020; kindly provided by Dr. C. Drosten) was propagated to passage 3 on
Vero E6 (ATCC® CRL 1586™) cells in Opti-MEM I (1X) + GlutaMAX (Gibco), supplemented with
penicillin (10,000 IU/mL) and streptomycin (10,000 IU/mL) at 37 °C in a humidified CO2 incubator.
Stocks were produced by infecting Vero E6 cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 and
incubating the cells for 72 hours at 37 °C in a humidified CO2 incubator. The culture supernatant was
cleared by centrifugation and frozen in aliquots at −80 °C. Stock titers were determined by preparing
10-fold serial dilutions in Opti-MEM I (1X) + GlutaMAX. Aliquots of each dilution were added to
monolayers of Vero E6 cells in the same medium in a 96-well plate. Twenty-four replicates were
performed per virus stock. Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 5 days and then screened for
cytopathic effect. The TCID50 was calculated according to the method of Spearman & Kärber. All
work with infectious SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 was performed in a Class II Biosafety Cabinet under
BSL-3 conditions at Erasmus University Medical Center.
Sample preparation for MS
A 90 % confluent T75 flask of VeroE6 was infected at a MOI of 0.3 and incubated for 24 hours at 37
°C in a humidified CO2 incubator. Next, cells were collected by scraping and the medium was
removed after centrifuging at 400 g for 5 min. Cells were lysed in 2X Laemmli buffer (final
concentration; Bio-Rad) and boiled at 95 °C for 20 min to inactivate the virus. Proteins were reduced
and alkylated with DTT (Sigma) and IAA (Sigma) and precipitated using chloroform/methanol 10. The
protein pellet was then dissolved in 100 µl of a 50 mM Tris/HCl buffer (pH 8.0) with 2 M urea.
Proteins were quantified using the BCA protein kit (ThermoFisher Scientific / Pierce, #23225);
peptides were quantified with a quantitative colorimetric peptide assay (ThermoFisher Scientific /
Pierce, #23275). Fifty µg of protein was digested with 1 µg trypsin (Thermo) overnight at room
temperature. The peptide digest was cleaned on a 50 mg tC18 Sep-Pak cartridge (Waters) and the
peptides were eluted with 2 ml acetonitrile/water (1:1) with 0.05 % TFA. For PRM measurements,
peptide samples with concentrations ranging from 0 to 25 ng/µl were prepared. For global
proteomics, peptides were fractionated off-line using high pH reversed-phase (ThermoFisher /
Pierce, #84868) into four fractions.
LC-MS
Peptide mixtures were trapped on a 2 cm x 100 μm Pepmap C18 column (ThermoFisher Scientific,
#164564) and separated on an in-house packed 50 cm x 75 μm capillary column with 1.9 μm
Reprosil-Pur C18 beads (Dr. Maisch) at a flow rate of 250 nL/min on an EASY-nLC 1200
(ThermoFisher Scientific), using a linear gradient of 0–32% acetonitrile (in 0.1 % formic acid) during
60 or 90 min. The eluate was directly sprayed into the mass spectrometer by means of electrospray
ionization (ESI).
For targeted proteomics, a parallel reaction monitoring regime (PRM) was used to select for a set of
previously selected peptides on an Orbitrap Eclipse Tribrid mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher
Scientific) operating in positive mode and running Tune version 3.3. Precursors were selected in the
quadrupole with an isolation width of 0.7 m/z and fragmented with HCD using 30 % collision energy
(CE). See Supplementary Table 2 for the isolation list. For global proteomics, data were recorded on

an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Tribrid mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientific) in data dependent
acquisition (DDA) mode. All MS1 and MS2 spectra were recorded in the orbitrap at 30,000 resolution
in profile mode and with standard AGC target settings. The injection time mode was set to dynamic
with a minimum of 9 points across the peak. The sequence of sampling was blanks first and then in
order of increasing peptide input amounts to avoid any contamination of previous samples.
Data analysis
Mass spectrometry data were analyzed using Mascot v 2.6.2 within the Proteome Discoverer v 2.3
(PD, ThermoFisher Scientific) framework or with MaxQuant v 1.6.10.43 (www.maxquant.org), all
with standard settings (note: fragment tolerance set to 20 ppm). PRM data were analyzed with
Skyline (skyline.ms). Spectra and chromatograms were visualized in PD 2.3, Skyline or the PDV
proteomics viewer (pdv.zhang-lab.org). For global proteome analyses the UniprotKB SARS2 database
(https://covid-19.uniprot.org/; 14 entries) was concatenated with the UniprotKB database,
taxonomy Chlorocebus (African green monkey). The total number of protein sequence entries that
were searched was 20,751.

RESULTS
We set off by analyzing the global proteome of Vero cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 using standard
bottom-up proteomics. Upon off-line high pH reversed-phase (RP) fractionation peptide LC-MS was
performed on an Orbitrap Lumos and RAW files were combined during data analysis. SARS-CoV-2
proteins were measured with high sequence coverage as exemplified in Figures 1–3. Based on a
label free semi-quantitative (LFQ) analysis of MaxQuant output data, we estimate that 4-5% of the
total proteome of this sample (composed of Vero cells, viral proteins inside cells and viral particles
outside of cells in the supernatant) is made up by viral proteins. Of all SARS-CoV-2 proteins covered
Nucleocapsid (NCAP) is the most abundant one, making up > 88 % of all signal intensity as calculated
from MaxQuant intensity values. Therefore, if intensity values can be used as a proxy for total
protein mass, almost 90 % of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome would consist of NCAP. Moreover, the high
number of identified Chlorocebus proteins (>6,000; see Supplementary Table 1) suggests that it is
possible to not only study SARS-CoV-2 proteins, but to also investigate the effects of viral infection
on the host cell proteome in great detail.
Based on the extensive sequence coverage for NCAP and several other SARS-CoV-2 proteins we
established a list of peptide targets that can be used for PRM targeting. These molecular finger prints
are used to program the mass spectrometer software in such a way that it acts as a filter to let only
those specific SARS-CoV-2 proteolytic fragments pass. This way, a specific set of target
peptides/proteins can be searched for in basically any sample from which proteins can be isolated
(e.g., in vitro cell cultures, patient derived samples).
For data visualization in this paper, three highly mass spectrometric responsive tryptic peptides were
selected from the global proteome data set as targets for PRM, i.e. GFYAEGSR (NACP_SARS2),
ADETQALPQR (NACP_SARS2) and EITVATSR (VME1_SARS2). Importantly, there are potentially a few
dozens of specific SARS-CoV-2 peptides that could be used for targeting, although some of these
may show slightly lower mass spectrometric responsiveness.
Our test sample (i.e., Vero cells infected with SARS-CoV-2, referred to as ‘cells+virus’) contained 2.0
mg/ml protein based on a BCA assay. The results of the colorimetric peptide quantification after
digestion were in agreement with this concentration. A dilution series was prepared from this
sample and the injected total peptide quantities ranged from 50 ng down to 20 pg. These extensively
diluted samples were then subjected to PRM on an Orbitrap Eclipse. Figures 4 and 5 show the results
of this PRM assay. The six most intense (Top6) fragment ion peaks are shown in different colors as
overlapping (in terms of retention time) peaks. The chromatogram excerpts are shown from top to
bottom and left to right for decreasing total protein input concentrations. The lower right
chromatogram in each panel shows the Top6 fragment ions in the sample corresponding to 20 pg
total protein input, which could thus be regarded as the limit of detection (LOD). It should be noted
that all PRM assays are performed on peptide targets that are present in a complex matrix, i.e. a
Vero cell lysate.
Based on a quick and provisional calculation we can make an estimation of the number of virus
particles that could in principle be detected based on this LOD. One assumption is that the general
composition of a virion is roughly 10 % RNA, 70 % proteins and 20 % lipids (weight percentages) and
the genomic RNA is ~30,000 nt 3. This would then correspond to roughly 9.0E6 Da RNA and 6.3E7 Da
total protein per virion. Based on the MaxQuant LFQ intensity data we assume that ~90 % of the
total SARS-CoV-2 proteome mass is composed of NCAP. This would be 5.7E7 Da, which for a 46 kDa
MW proteins corresponds to 1,240 molecules. This number of Nucleocapsid copies per virion is in
the same ballpark as copy numbers of 2,600 that have been reported for Nucleocapsid of other RNA

viruses (e.g., 11,12). Furthermore, the sample in which specific SARS-CoV-2 target peptides can still be
detected (20 pg sample) is estimated to contain 5 % viral proteins and this then represents 0.9 pg
NCAP (20 amol, or 12E6 molecules) and would correspond to ~10,000 virus particles, under the
assumption that all NCAP present is assembled into virus particles.
The above numbers are based on several assumptions. For the accurate quantitation of viral
proteins, known quantities of heavy isotope labeled peptide analogs (AQUA) should be used as
spike-in in LC-MS analyses.

CONLUSIONS & PERSPECTIVES
We have shown that tryptic peptides of SARS-CoV-2 proteins (NCAP, VME1) can be detected down
to the mid-attomole range by targeted orbitrap mass spectrometry. Our calculations indicate that
the level of sensitivity should be sufficient to detect protein amounts theoretically corresponding to
approximately 10,000 SARS-CoV-2 particles. Whether this sensitivity is sufficient for this technology
to play a role in diagnostics of COVID-19 largely depends on the amount of virus material that is
present in patient material such as nasopharyngeal swabs, mucus, gargle solution, remains to be
seen and is subject of further research. It is likely that the majority of viral proteins in swab samples
consists of (unpackaged) proteins present within cells. In addition, it is currently unknown what
proportion of SARS-CoV-2 particles in clinical specimens is infectious. Data from RT-qPCR determined
genome copy numbers on virus culture supernatant suggest that infectious titers are around 2 logs
lower than genome copy numbers for coronaviruses (data not shown).
PRM sensitivity in terms of numbers of detected virus particles is – as expected – not as high as that
of RT-qPCR, which reaches a 95 % hit rate at about 100 copies of RNA genome equivalent per
reaction 13. A major difference compared to conventional methods of viral diagnostics is that
proteins are analyzed as opposed to RNA in case of (RT-q)PCR. Therefore, protein based methods
could present an orthogonal and complementary way of diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection and
disease.
The level of sensitivity is most likely sufficient for many applications in SARS-CoV-2 research.
Moreover, the excellent label free quantitation capacity over a wide concentration range
outperforms immunoassays and makes this method particularly useful for the study of infection
courses over time. By using heavy isotope labeled peptide analogs (AQUA), PRM analysis can be
improved both in terms of sensitivity and specificity 14. Using AQUA peptides as spike-in, it would
even be possible to absolutely quantitate viral proteins. This allows one to accurately monitor
abundances of SARS-CoV-2 proteins in e.g. time series, which could be useful to study the course of
infection and for solving questions on viral load.
The level of sensitivity established with the here described targeted proteomics methodology opens
up ways to explore the use of mass spectrometry as a diagnostic tool to detect viral infection in
patient material. If this sensitivity turns out to be sufficient for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 proteins
in e.g. nasopharyngeal swabs, mucus or blood, subsequent steps should be to the optimization of
faster sample preparation procedures and improvements in analysis throughput.
