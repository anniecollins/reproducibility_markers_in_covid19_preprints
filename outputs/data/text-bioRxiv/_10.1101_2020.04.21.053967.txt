Abstract
Evolution couples differences in ambient pH to biological function through protonatable
groups, in particular those that switch from buried to exposed and alter protonation state in
doing so. We present a tool focusing on structure-based discovery and display of these
groups. Since prediction of buried group pKas is computationally intensive, solvent
accessibility of ionisable groups is displayed, from which the user can iteratively select pKa
calculation centers. Results are color-coded, with emphasis on buried groups. Utility is
demonstrated with coronaviruses, which exhibit variable dependence on the acidic pH of the
endocytotic pathway. After benchmarking with variants of murine hepatitis virus, a pair of
conserved histidine residues are identified that are predicted to be electrostatically frustrated
at acidic pH in a common structural core of pre- and post-fusion coronavirus spike proteins.
We suggest that an intermediate expanded conformation at endosomal pH could relax the
frustration, allowing histidine protonation, and facilitating conformational conversion. This
tool is available at http://www.protein-sol.manchester.ac.uk/pka/.

Introduction
Since pKas underlie pH-dependent phenomena in biology, their prediction has received
significant attention, largely through continuum electrostatics methods (Alexov et al., 2011).
We have contributed a server for predicting pH and ionic strength dependence with a DebyeHückel (DH) model that accounts for solvent exposed groups, which are generally in the great
majority (Hebditch and Warwicker, 2019). However, conformational change often depends on
the electrostatic frustration (destabilization) that develops when a buried group cannot ionize
at a pH where it would in a more solvent accessible conformation (Narayan and Naganathan,
2018). We reasoned that a web tool focusing on buried ionizable groups would be useful for
studying pH-dependent conformational change, and have adapted our existing mixed finite
difference Poisson-Boltzmann (FDPB) and DH model. Here, the server is demonstrated with
coronaviruses, some of which use the endocytotic pathway for membrane fusion, whereas
others fuse at the plasma membrane. We focus on the pre- to post-fusion conformational
changes in the S2 part of the spike protein, that mediates membrane fusion (Heald-Sargent
and Gallagher, 2012).

Methods
We have sought to limit FDPB/DH run time for pKa predictions (Warwicker, 2004) to about
two minutes processing. Upon upload of a structure, the user is presented with a color-coded
display (NGL viewer, Rose et al., 2018) of solvent accessible surface area (ASA) values for
ionizable groups. A user iteratively specifies centers, around which pKa calculations are made
for spheres of radius 25 Å (about the size of lysozyme). Edge effects do not have a big effect
on predicted pKas towards the sphere centre. Results for Asp, Glu, Lys, Arg, His accumulate
as more centers are added, and are color-coded to show whether a group is stabilizing or
destabilizing, assessed from the difference between calculated and intrinsic pKa (capped at 5 and 5). Users may either use ionisable group ASA/burial or literature knowledge of
interesting sites, to select pKa calculation centers. It is envisaged that the server will allow a
user to quickly survey a set of structures for potential pH-dependence hotspots, rather than
provide a great depth of analysis for each structure.

Results
Although there are about 40 structures of pre-fusion coronavirus spike proteins, there is just
one post-fusion structure available (April 2020) that extends beyond the helical fusion core,

for murine hepatitis virus (MHV) strain A59 (6b3o, Walls et al., 2017). A pre-fusion structure
for MHV A59 is also available (3jcl, Walls et al., 2016). In a variant of mouse hepatitis virus
type 4 (MHV4), spike protein Q1015H, Q1042H (MHV A59 numbering) and one further
mutation (L to R) render the virus pH-dependent, via the endocytotic pathway (Gallagher et
al., 1991). Modelling the mutations to histidine in the MHV A59 background, we find they are
predicted to be buried in the pre-fusion form (destabilizing, not shown) and exposed in the
post-fusion structure (not destabilizing, Fig. 1a). Color schemes for ASA and pKa-related
stabilization are given (Fig. 1b). Our results are consistent with the relief of electrostatic
frustration at endosomal pH biasing conformation away from the pre-fusion structure. The
story is a little more complicated, since the MHV4 variant also loses fusion activity at neutral
pH (Gallagher et al., 1991), which could be due to additional stabilization of the pre-fusion
form with pH-independent histidine interactions.

Fig. 1c shows equivalent parts (972 – 1118) of a monomer from pre- and post-fusion MHV
A59, structurally aligned through a small common core around 1098/1114. Extending from the
structurally aligned segments are helices that demonstrate the extensive spike protein
structural changes that go along with cell fusion. Whereas the helical region wraps back

around the aligned core in the pre-fusion structure, it extends upwards post-fusion, carrying
the fusion peptide towards its target membrane, shown by the relative locations of 1015.
Switching to conserved histidines and general coronavirus features, only two are present
across the spike proteins of coronaviruses, H1098 and H1114 (MHV A59 numbering). In 37
of 38 pre-fusion coronavirus spike protein structures, as well as the post-fusion structure,
H1098 and H1114 are buried and predicted to be destabilizing upon exposure to acidic pH
(Fig. 1a, red spacefill). If these conserved histidines are electrostatically frustrated in both preand post-fusion conformations at endosomal pH, they would not bias towards either form.
However, to allow the extensive changes exemplified in Fig. 1c, it is possible that the core
region around H1098/H1114 loosens. If H1098 and/or H1114 were solvent exposed and
protonated, then relief from frustration in a conformational intermediate could play a role in
facilitating transfer between post- and pre-fusion structures in coronaviruses that use the
endocytotic pathway, including SARS-CoV-2 (Ou et al., 2020). In this proposal, H1098/H1114
assistance in crossing the pre- to post-fusion conformational barrier would be available to
those viruses that are unable to fuse at the plasma membrane. Interestingly, both H1098A
and H1114A mutations in MHV A59 prevented virus growth (Li et al., 2018), perhaps indicative
of (pH-independent) packing stabilizations in their buried environments, so that evolutionary
retention for fusion could be afforded by a more direct structural imperative. This would be in
line with the coupling of factors that determine infection pathways, including spike protein
stability, receptor binding, proteolytic cleavage, as well as endosomal pH (Heald-Sargent and
Gallagher, 2012; Millet and Whittaker, 2015). If the proposed loosening around the conserved
post- and pre-fusion core is borne out, then although it may not be universally necessary (in
pH-dependent entry), it could be the basis for a novel, albeit transient, coronavirus drug target.
Our web tool will allow users to look for ionisable groups that could mediate pH-dependence
in coronaviruses and other systems.
