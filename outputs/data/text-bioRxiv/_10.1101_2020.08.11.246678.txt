Abstract
Interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) restrict infections by many viruses, but a
subset of IFITMs enhance infections by specific coronaviruses through currently unknown
mechanisms. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 Spike-pseudotyped virus and genuine SARSCoV-2 infections are generally restricted by expression of human IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3,
using both gain- and loss-of-function approaches. Mechanistically, restriction of SARS-CoV-2
occurred independently of IFITM3 S-palmitoylation sites, indicating a restrictive capacity that is
distinct from reported inhibition of other viruses. In contrast, the IFITM3 amphipathic helix and
its amphipathic properties were required for virus restriction. Mutation of residues within the
human IFITM3 endocytosis-promoting YxxF motif converted human IFITM3 into an enhancer of
SARS-CoV-2 infection, and cell-to-cell fusion assays confirmed the ability of endocytic mutants
to enhance Spike-mediated fusion with the plasma membrane. Overexpression of TMPRSS2,
which reportedly increases plasma membrane fusion versus endosome fusion of SARS-CoV-2,
attenuated IFITM3 restriction and converted amphipathic helix mutants into strong enhancers of
infection. In sum, these data uncover new pro- and anti-viral mechanisms of IFITM3, with clear
distinctions drawn between enhancement of viral infection at the plasma membrane and
amphipathicity-based mechanisms used for endosomal virus restriction. Indeed, the net effect
of IFITM3 on SARS-CoV-2 infections may be a result of these opposing activities, suggesting
that shifts in the balance of these activities could be coopted by viruses to escape this important
first line innate defense mechanism.

Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV)-2 is the causative agent
of the respiratory and multi-organ-associated disease known as COVID-19 (Wu, Zhao et al.,
2020, Zhu, Zhang et al., 2020). Understanding virus-host interactions and immune responses
will be critical for explaining the high variation in severity of COVID-19 observed in humans
(Zhang, Tan et al., 2020). Type I interferon (IFN) is a critical component of the innate immune
system that induces expression of hundreds of genes, many of which encode proteins with
antiviral activities that block specific steps in viral replication cycles (Chemudupati, Kenney et
al., 2019, Schoggins, Wilson et al., 2011). Among these are genes that encode the IFN-induced
transmembrane proteins (IFITMs), including IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3. IFITMs have been
shown to block membrane fusion of diverse enveloped viruses by using an amphipathic helix
domain to mechanically alter membrane lipid order and curvature in a manner that disfavors
virus fusion (Chesarino, Compton et al., 2017, Guo, Steinkühler et al., 2020, Li, Markosyan et
al., 2013, Lin, Chin et al., 2013). While IFITMs have been shown in most instances to inhibit
CoV infections (Bertram, Dijkman et al., 2013, Huang, Bailey et al., 2011, Wrensch, Winkler et
al., 2014, Zheng, Zhao et al., 2020), in some cases they enhance infections(Zhao, Guo et al.,
2014, Zhao, Sehgal et al., 2018). For example, IFITM2 and IFITM3 enhance cellular entry of
human CoV-OC43 (Zhao et al., 2014). Similarly, infections by virus-like particles containing
SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV glycoprotein (pseudovirus) are increased upon expression of an
IFITM3 variant with enhanced plasma membrane localization versus endosomal localization
(Zhao et al., 2018). Given that polymorphisms in the genes encoding IFITM2 and IFITM3 have
been proposed to increase their plasma membrane localization (Chesarino, McMichael et al.,
2014a, Everitt, Clare et al., 2012, Jia, Xu et al., 2014, Wu, Grotefend et al., 2017), and that an
additional polymorphism in the IFITM3 gene promoter results in significant loss of IFITM3
expression (Allen, Randolph et al., 2017), determining whether IFITMs affect SARS-CoV-2

cellular infections should be informative for understanding susceptibility and resistance of
human cells to infection.
Published experimental results are contradictory with regard to the effect of IFITMs on
SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. SARS-CoV-2 Spike-pseudotyped vesicular stomatitis virus infection
was inhibited by human IFITM2 and IFITM3, but not IFITM1, in an overexpression screen of IFN
effector proteins(Zang, Case et al., 2020). In contrast, IFITM3 overexpression did not inhibit
infection of Spike-containing pseudovirus in a separate study (Zhao, Zheng et al., 2020). IFITMs
have also been reported to inhibit cell-to-cell fusion induced by SARS-CoV-2 Spike
protein(Buchrieser, Dufloo et al., 2020), though a conflicting report did not observe inhibition of
Spike-mediated cell fusion when IFITM2 or IFITM3 were expressed in target cells (Zang et al.,
2020). Overall, the impact of IFITMs on SARS-CoV-2 infections remains unclear and has yet to
be examined with bona fide SARS-CoV-2. Herein, we measure the effects of mouse and human
IFITMs on SARS-CoV-2 infections using both pseudovirus and genuine virus systems. We
further utilize a series of mutants affecting critical functional amino acid motifs within IFITM3 and
identify pro- and anti-viral effects that we clearly delineate in terms of distinct cellular locations
and mechanisms of action.

Results
IFITMs inhibit SARS-CoV-2 Spike-pseudotyped lentivirus infection
To explore the effects of human IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 on SARS-CoV-2 infection, we
transfected the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, ACE2, into HEK293T cells stably expressing FLAGtagged IFITM constructs. We then infected the transfected cells with SARS-CoV-2 Spikepseudotyped HIV-1 expressing luciferase (HIV-SARS-2), and measured luciferase production at
48 hpi. Compared to vector control cells, each of the IFITM-expressing lines showed
significantly less luciferase production, indicating inhibition of Spike-mediated infection, with
IFITM1 expression exhibiting particularly strong inhibition (Fig 1A). We also observed that all

three of the IFITMs inhibited SARS-CoV Spike-pseudotyped lentivirus infection (HIV-SARS1)(Fig 1B), with IFITM3 appearing to exhibit relatively more antiviral activity against HIV-SARS1 than HIV-SARS-2 (Fig 1A,B). We confirmed uniform expression of each of the FLAG-tagged
IFITM constructs by flow cytometry (Fig 1C). We further confirmed the ability of these IFITM
constructs to limit HIV-SARS-2 infection in transiently-transfected Caco-2 cells, which naturally
express ACE2 (Fig 1D). Furthermore, Caco-2 cells express basal IFITM3 protein at relatively
high levels, while IFITM1 and IFITM2 are nearly absent. Knockdown of IFITM3 by siRNA
transfection increased HIV-SARS-2 infection (Fig 1E). IFNb treatment of Caco-2 cells strongly
inhibited HIV-SARS-2 infection, which could be partially reversed with siRNA-mediated
knockdown of IFITM3 (Fig 1E,F). These results indicate that basal, IFN-induced, and ectopically
expressed IFITM3 inhibits HIV-SARS-2 infection of Caco-2 cells, and that, while multiple IFN
stimulated genes are likely involved in repression of infection, IFITM3 is among those critical
factors. In sum, our experiments indicate that IFITMs, both when overexpressed endogenously
or ectopically, are restrictive of SARS-CoV-2 Spike-mediated virus infection

IFITMs inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infections
We next sought to validate results from pseudotyped virus infections using genuine SARS-CoV2 at Biosafety Level 3. We utilized HEK293T cell lines stably expressing IFITMs (Fig 2A) that
were transiently transfected with ACE2-GFP, and measured percent infection via staining for
viral N protein and flow cytometry. Consistent with past reports suggesting low endogenous
ACE2 expression in HEK293T cells, we found that infection was limited to cells that were ACE2GFP positive (Fig 2B). We thus employed a gating strategy that focused on ACE2-GFP positive
cells for measuring percent infection. Similar to results with Spike-pseudotyped lentivirus, we
found that human IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 were each capable of inhibiting SARS-CoV-2
infections (Fig 2C,D). Additionally, we examined a cell line expressing a palmitoylation-deficient
IFITM3 triple cysteine mutant (C71A, C72A, C105A; termed PalmD) that has been shown to

lose activity against influenza virus and other viruses (Benfield, MacKenzie et al., 2020, Hach,
McMichael et al., 2013, John, Chin et al., 2013, McMichael, Zhang et al., 2017, Percher,
Ramakrishnan et al., 2016, Yount, Karssemeijer et al., 2012, Yount, Moltedo et al., 2010).
Remarkably, IFITM3-PalmD maintained restriction of SARS-CoV-2 (Fig 2D). Given the highly
unusual result with the IFITM3-PalmD cell line, we sought to authenticate the cell line by
performing an influenza virus infection alongside one of our SARS-CoV-2 infections. Indeed, we
confirmed the well-established results that IFITM3 strongly restricts influenza virus infection in a
palmitoylation-dependent manner (Fig 2E) (Chesarino et al., 2017, Chesarino, McMichael et al.,
2014b, Hach et al., 2013, McMichael et al., 2017, Melvin, McMichael et al., 2015, Percher et al.,
2016, Yount et al., 2012, Yount et al., 2010). These results suggest that IFITMs provide
palmitoylation-independent restriction of SARS-CoV-2 that is distinct from other viruses.

Human IFITM3 with mutations in its endocytic YxxF motif enhances SARS-CoV-2
infection
We additionally sought to confirm the effects of IFITMs on SARS-CoV-2 by transfecting
IFITM constructs into stable HEK293T-ACE2-GFP cells. To measure SARS-CoV-2 infection,
we employed a flow cytometry gating strategy in which cells that were expressing the highest
levels of ACE2-GFP as well as IFITMs were analyzed for percent infection (Fig 3A,B). We
again found that human IFITMs inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection, though effects of transiently
transfected IFITM2 did not reach statistical significance (Fig 3C,D). We also confirmed via
transient transfection that IFITM3-PalmD is active in restricting the virus (Fig 3C,D). We further
found that, consistent with past results examining endogenous ACE2 (Huang et al., 2011),
IFITM expression did not affect levels of exogenously expressed ACE2-GFP (Fig E,F). We
additionally examined mouse Ifitm1-3 and found that restriction of SARS-CoV-2 infection is a

conserved activity of mouse and human IFITMs, and that restriction by mouse IFITM3 occurred
independently of palmitoylation like its human counterpart (Fig 4A-C).
We next examined mouse and human IFITM3 mutants that impact protein localization.
Y20 is a critical amino acid within a YxxF endocytosis motif (20-YEML-23 in human IFITM3),
and has been shown in several studies to be required for active endocytosis of
IFITM3(Chesarino et al., 2014a, Jia, Pan et al., 2012, Jia et al., 2014, McMichael, Zhang et al.,
2018). Mutation of Y20 or blocking this residue via phosphorylation by Src kinases results in
accumulation of IFITM3 at the plasma membrane (Chesarino et al., 2014a, Compton, Roy et al.,
2016, Jia et al., 2012, Jia et al., 2014, McMichael et al., 2018). Human IFITM3-Y20A caused an
increase in SARS-CoV-2 infection as compared to vector control cells, suggesting that IFITM3
at the plasma membrane promotes, rather than inhibits, infection (Fig 3C,D). In contrast, mouse
IFITM3-Y20A did not increase infection compared to vector control cells (Fig 4B,C), revealing a
species-specific distinction between mouse and human IFITM3 in their ability to promote SARSCoV-2 infection. To confirm that enhancement of infection was due to disruption of the 20YEML-23 endocytosis motif, we tested an additional construct, human IFITM3-L23Q, which
similarly accumulates at the plasma membrane due to disruption of the critical F residue of the
endocytosis signal (Chesarino et al., 2014a). IFITM3-L23Q expression also increased SARSCoV-2 infection, confirming the unusual ability of IFITM3 to enhance infection of this virus (Fig
3C,D). Overall, these results demonstrate that while mouse and human IFITMs generally
restrict infection, human IFITM3 can promote infection when its localization is shifted toward the
plasma membrane.

Human IFITM3 with mutations in its endocytic YxxF motif enhances SARS-CoV-2 Spikemediated cell-to-cell fusion

We next examined whether IFITM3 affects SARS-CoV-2 Spike-mediated membrane
fusion in a cell-to-cell fusion assay. U2OS cells co-transfected with Spike and mCherry
expression plasmids were mixed with Calu-3 target cells that were co-transfected with plasmids
encoding EGFP and IFITMs. After 24 h co-culture, mCherry and EGFP double positive multinucleated cell syncytia could be observed dependent upon the presence of Spike protein,
demonstrating Spike-mediated fusion between the two cell types (Fig 5A). Upon transfection of
IFITM3 into Calu-3 target cells, double positive syncytia remained readily observable upon
visual inspection, though quantification of nuclei number within these double positive syncytia
suggested that IFITM3 may have a modest ability to limit S-mediated cell-to-cell fusion (Fig
5A,B). In contrast, transfection of IFITM3-Y20A or IFITM3-L23Q resulted in an increase in the
size of double positive syncytia as compared to vector control or WT IFITM3 transfections,
which was confirmed by quantification of nuclei per syncytia (Fig 5A,B). These results provide
confirmation of infection experiments indicating that IFITM3 enriched at the plasma membrane
due to endocytosis-impairing mutations enhances SARS-CoV-2 Spike-mediated membrane
fusion.

Anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of IFITM3 requires its amphipathic helix domain and is
counteracted by TMPRSS2 overexpression
Our results suggest that IFITM3 is able to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection overall, but that
shifting human IFITM3 localization away from the endosomal system and toward the plasma
membrane results in enhancement of infection (Fig 2, 3). Given that SARS-CoV-2 has dual
cellular entry pathways involving Spike proteolytic activation either at the plasma membrane or
within endosomes (Hoffmann, Kleine-Weber et al., 2020, Shang, Wan et al., 2020), these
findings may indicate that IFITM3 has distinct effects on the virus dependent upon the location
at which virus fuses with the cell membrane. Plasma membrane-associated processing of Spike
involves TMPRSS2 protease, and it has been reported that TMPRSS2 overexpression

increases the proportion of virus able to fuse at the cell surface (Hoffmann et al., 2020). Further,
it is reported that high TMPRSS2 levels allow coronaviruses to avoid restriction by IFITMs
(Bertram et al., 2013, Zheng et al., 2020). In line with these data, we found that TMPRSS2
overexpression decreased the ability of IFITM3 to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig 6A,B).
Interestingly, IFITM3 slightly enhanced infection in the presence of TMPRSS2 overexpression in
2 out of 3 experiments (Fig 6B). Inhibition of infection by IFITM3-PalmD and IFITM1 was also
counteracted by TMPRSS2, though enhancement of infection was not observed for these
constructs (Fig 6A,B).
The IFITM3 amphipathic helix domain located at amino acid positions 59-68 is required
for inhibition of influenza virus infection (Chesarino et al., 2017). This helix was recently shown
to be able to alter mechanical properties of lipid membranes, such as curvature and lipid order,
thus inhibiting viral membrane fusion(Guo et al., 2020). In the context of SARS-CoV-2, we found
that expression of an amphipathic helix-deleted mutant of IFITM3 (D59-68) resulted in a modest
enhancement rather than inhibition of infection (Fig 6A,B). Likewise, decreasing amphipathicity
of the helix by mutation of its three hydrophilic residues (S61A, N64A, T65A), decreased
restriction of infection (Fig 6A,B), further demonstrating that the amphipathicity of IFITM3, and
likely its associated membrane-altering properties, underlie restriction of SARS-CoV-2. Notably,
both of the amphipathic helix mutants were increased in their ability to enhance SARS-CoV-2
infection when co-expressed with TMPRSS2 (Fig 6A,B), providing the first clear evidence that
IFITM3 enhancement of CoV infection occurs via a mechanism distinct from its amphipathicitybased membrane alterations. These results support a model wherein IFITM3 exerts opposing
activities on SARS-CoV-2, including amphipathicity-dependent restriction of virus at endosomes
and amphipathicity-independent enhancement of infection at the plasma membrane.

Discussion
In the present study we have identified IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 as restrictors of SARSCoV-2 infection of cells. Our result showing that IFITM3 inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection
independently of S-palmitoylation is surprising since intact palmitoylation sites are necessary for
inhibition of a number of viruses, including influenza virus, dengue virus, CoV-NL63, and CoV229E (Benfield et al., 2020, Hach et al., 2013, John et al., 2013, McMichael et al., 2017, Percher
et al., 2016, Yount et al., 2012, Yount et al., 2010, Zhao et al., 2018). This conclusion is
supported by experiments with three distinct expression systems (stable transduction of human
IFITM3-PalmD in the pLenti vector and transient transfections of human and mouse IFITM3PalmD in pCMV) (Fig 2,3,4). Previous work suggests that S-palmitoylation increases the rate at
which IFITM3 traffics to influenza virus-containing endosomes during infection (Spence, He et
al., 2019). Our results suggest possible differences between influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2
either in their endocytic entry pathways or fusion kinetics, and IFITM constructs may prove
useful in dissecting such differences.
Mechanistically, we found that the IFITM3 amphipathic helix is necessary for its SARSCoV-2 restrictive capacity (Fig 6). We previously showed that this helix was also required for
restriction of influenza virus and proposed that the helix affected virus fusion by wedging into the
inner leaflet of the membrane bilayer, thus generating local membrane curvature that is
disfavorable to virus-to-cell fusion (Chesarino et al., 2017). More recent research has shown
that the amphipathic helix is indeed able to mechanically induce membrane curvature and
increase lipid order (Guo et al., 2020). Overall, IFITMs likely restrict SARS-CoV-2 infection by
mechanically disfavoring viral membrane fusion reactions occurring at endosomes.
Remarkably, we observed that IFITM3-Y20A and -L23Q constructs enhance SARSCoV-2 infection (Fig 4). Since these constructs are well characterized to accumulate at the
plasma membrane of cells due to loss of interaction with the AP-2 endocytic adaptor protein

complex (Chesarino et al., 2014a, Jia et al., 2014, McMichael et al., 2018), these data suggest
that IFITM3 localization to the plasma membrane enhances infection. Given that WT IFITM3
traffics to the plasma membrane prior to its endocytosis, and since phosphorylation of IFITM3
Y20 by Src kinases also blocks endocytosis (Chesarino et al., 2014a, Jia et al., 2012), there are
likely opposing restrictive and enhancing activities occurring in cells expressing WT IFITM3. It
will be interesting to determine whether these balances are shifted in different cell types with
distinct endocytic or phosphorylation capacities.
Enhancement of SARS-CoV-2 infection at the plasma membrane does not require the
IFITM3 amphipathic helix, as demonstrated by our observation that TMPRSS2 overexpression
converts amphipathic helix mutants into strong enhancers of infection (Fig 6). We did not
observe an enhancing effect of human IFITM1, which also has a conserved and functional
amphipathic helix domain (Chesarino et al., 2017), further supporting that enhancement of
infection at the plasma membrane is not occurring via amphipathic helix-mediated mechanical
membrane alterations (Fig 6). These data are in alignment with past reports that IFITM3, but
not IFITM1, enhances CoV-OC43 infections (Zhao et al., 2014). Removal of the IFITM1
extended C-terminal tail converted IFITM1 into an enhancer of specific CoV infections (Zhao et
al., 2014, Zhao et al., 2018). Likewise, and similar to our results with SARS-CoV-2, mutation of
human IFITM3 Y20 was also reported to enhance SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV pseudotype virus
infections, but not CoV-229E or CoV-NL63 pseudotype infections (Zhao et al., 2018). Since
enhancement of infection does not correlate with specific receptor usage of the different
coronaviruses, it is unlikely that IFITMs directly affect the virus receptors. In that regard, we did
not observe an effect of IFITM proteins on levels of exogenously expressed ACE2-GFP (Fig
3E,F). It may be possible that the short IFITM3 C-terminal tail, predicted to be exposed at the
cell surface, directly interacts with specific features of CoV surface glycoproteins or with entry
factors. It is also interesting to note that mouse IFITM3 has an extended C-terminal tail
compared to human IFITM3, consistent with results that mouse IFITM3-Y20A did not enhance

infection (Fig 4B,C). Overall, our results indicate that IFITMs are not likely exerting a broad
mechanism of amphipathicity-based membrane alteration to promote infection, but rather are
more specifically coopted by specific CoVs, such as SARS-CoV-2, under certain conditions. An
early study on a limited cohort suggests that the human IFITM3 rs12552-C SNP, which has
been proposed to result in IFITM3 plasma membrane localization (Chesarino et al., 2014a,
Everitt et al., 2012, Jia et al., 2012), is a risk factor for severe COVID-19(Zhang, Qin et al.,
2020). Larger studies are warranted to examine whether this and other polymorphisms in
IFITM3 (Zani & Yount, 2018) positively or negatively influence COVID-19 severity.

Materials and Methods
Biosafety
All work with live SARS-CoV-2 was performed at Biosafety Level 3 (BSL3) according to
standard operating procedures approved by the Ohio State University BSL3 Operations Group
and Institutional Biosafety Committee. Samples were removed from the BSL3 facility for flow
cytometry analysis only after decontamination with 4% paraformaldehyde for a minimum of 1 h
according to an in-house validated and approved method of sample decontamination.

Cell lines and cell culture
All cells were cultured at 37°C with 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator and were grown in
Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS (Atlas Biologicals).
HEK293T, Calu-3, and Caco-2 were purchased from ATCC. The origin of our U2OS cells are
unknown, but the identity and purity of the cells were verified by STR profiling. Vero E6 cells
were a kind gift from Dr. Mark Peeples (Nationwide Children’s Hospital) and were treated with
Mycoplasma Removal Agent (MP Biomedical) for 1 month to ensure lack of contamination
before virus propagation. All other cell lines were routinely treated with Mycoplasma Removal
Agent for 1 week upon thawing of new cultures. HEK293T cells stably expressing human

IFITM1, IFITM2, IFITM3, IFITM3-PalmΔ, or empty pLenti-puro vector that were used in genuine
virus infections were generated and validated as described previously (McMichael et al., 2018),
with the exception that the IFITM3-PalmΔ cell line required three sequential transductions to
achieve expression comparable to WT IFITM3 in the majority of the cells. HEK293T cells stably
expressing GFP-tagged human ACE2 (Origene) were generated using the same methodology.
HEK293T cell lines stably transduced with FLAG-tagged human IFITM1, IFITM2, IFITM3, or
pQCXIP vector control for HIV-SARS-1 and HIV-SARS-2 infection experiments were described
previously (Shi, Ozog et al., 2018). Type -I interferon (human recombinant interferon beta, NR3085, BEI Resources) was added to Caco-2 cells at 48h post siRNA transfection at a
concentration of 250 IU/mL. Cells were incubated with interferon for a 24h period prior to being
removed and replaced with virus inoculum.

SARS-CoV-2 propagation and titering
SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 stock from BEI Resources was diluted 1:10,000 in DMEM and
added to confluent Vero cells for 1 h at 37°C. Following the 1 h infection period, viruscontaining media was replaced with DMEM containing 4% FBS and incubated at 37°C for 72 h
at which point significant cytopathic effect was observed. Cell supernatant containing infectious
virus was centrifuged at 1,000 x g for 10 min to remove cell debris, and was aliquoted, flash
frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80°C. Virus titer was determined by TCID50 assay in
Vero cells using the presence of cytopathic effect coupled with viral N protein staining for
identification of infected wells. The viral stock titer was further confirmed by standard plaque
assay with 0.3% agarose (Sigma) overlay and visualization with 0.25% Crystal Violet (Sigma) in
Vero cells. Full genome sequencing of the virus stock by the Ohio State University Medical
Center Clinical Diagnostics Laboratory confirmed an absence of major mutations or deletions,
including within the Spike protein furin cleavage site.

Plasmids, transfections, and siRNA knockdowns
Plasmid encoding untagged ACE2 was a gift from Hyeryun Choe (Addgene plasmid # 1786;
http://n2t.net/addgene:1786; RRID:Addgene_786). Transfection of HEK293T cell lines stably
expressing human IFITM1, IFITM2 or IFITM3 (35) with ACE2 was performed with TransIT-293
reagent (Mirus). Transfection of Caco-2 cells with empty pQCXIP or pQCXIP-IFITM1, -IFITM2, IFITM3 (gifts from Chen Liang) was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher).
For SARS-CoV-2 infection experiments, pCMV expression plasmid for N-terminally HA-tagged
human and mouse IFITM1, IFITM2, IFITM3, IFITM3-PalmΔ and IFITM3-Y20A as well as human
IFITM3-L23Q, IFITM3-Δ59-68, and IFITM3-S61A,N64A,T65A were previously described
(Chesarino et al., 2017, Chesarino et al., 2014a, Hach et al., 2013, Percher et al., 2016, Yount
et al., 2010). TMPRSS2 in pCAGGS was a kind gift from Dr. Stephan Pöhlmann (Georg-AugustUniversität Göttingen). ACE2-GFP in pLenti-puro was purchased from Origene. All transient
transfections for SARS-CoV-2 infection experiments were performed using LipoJet transfection
reagent (Signagen Laboratories). siRNAs targeting IFITM1 (s16192), IFITM2 (s20771), IFITM3
(s195035) and a non-targeting siRNA control pool (4390844) were purchased from Ambion.
siRNA-mediated knockdown was performed by transfecting Caco-2 cells with 20 nM amounts of
siRNA and Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Thermo Fisher). Knockdown efficiency was assessed by
Western blot analysis at 72h post transfection.

Pseudotyped virus infections and luciferase assays
Virus-like particles pseudotyped with SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV-1 Spike protein were
produced by transfecting HEK293T cells with a plasmid encoding HIV-1 NL4-3 lacking vpr and
encoding luciferase in place of env (a gift from Vineet KewalRamani) and pcDNA-SARS-CoV2C9 or pcDNA-SARS-CoV1-C9 (gifts from Thomas Gallagher) using TransIT-293 reagent. Cells
were incubated with virus-containing medium for 72h, after which cells were lysed with Passive

Lysis Buffer (Promega). Luciferase assays were performed using Luciferase Assay System
(Promega). Luciferase values were measured with a Tecan Infinite M1000 plate reader.

SARS-CoV-2 infections and flow cytometry
Cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 for 24 hours, after which cells were fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde (Thermo Scientific) for 1 h at room temperature, permeabilized with PBS
containing 0.1% TritonX-100, and blocked with PBS/2% FBS. Cells were then stained with
mouse-produced anti-SARS-CoV-2 N (Sino Biological) and a cocktail of rabbit-produced antiIFITM2/3 (ProteinTech) and anti-IFITM1 (Cell Signaling Technologies). Primary antibody
labeling was followed by labeling with anti-mouse-AlexaFluor-647 and anti-rabbit-AlexaFluor555 secondary antibodies (Life Technologies). Flow cytometry data was collected using a
FACSCanto II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Data analysis was performed using FlowJo
software. Infected cell gates were set using non-infected control samples.

Cell fusion assay
Using Lipofectamine 3000 (Life Technologies), U2OS cells were co-transfected with pmCherry
and either empty pCAGGS vector or SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoprotein (BEI Resources,
deposited by Dr. Florian Krammer, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai); Calu-3 cells were
co-transfected with pEGFP and either empty pCMV vector, IFITM3, IFITM3-Y20A, or IFITM3L23Q. Transfected Calu-3 and U2OS cells were mixed and co-incubated for 24 hours. Following
incubation, the co-cultures were contra-stained with Hoechst 33342 and imaged using a Nikon
Eclipse Ti-E inverted microscope (Nikon Instruments). Nikon NIS Elements AR software was
used to quantify fusion indices calculated as number of nuclei per double-positive (expressing
both EGFP and mCherry) cell fusion cluster.
