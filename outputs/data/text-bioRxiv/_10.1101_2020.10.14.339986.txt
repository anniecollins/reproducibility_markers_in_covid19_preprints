We present a common methodological framework to infer the phylogenomics from genomic data,
be it reads of SARS-CoV-2 of multiple COVID-19 patients or bulk DNAseq of the tumor of a cancer
patient. The commonality is in the phylogenetic retrodiction based on the genomic reads in both
scenarios. While there is evidence of heteroplasmy, i.e., multiple lineages of SARS-CoV-2 in the
same COVID-19 patient; to date, there is no evidence of sublineages recombining within the same
patient. The heterogeneity in a patient’s tumor is analogous to intra-patient heteroplasmy and the
absence of recombination in the cells of tumor is a widely accepted assumption. Just as the different
frequencies of the genomic variants in a tumor presupposes the existence of multiple tumor clones
and provides a handle to computationally infer them, we postulate that so do the different variant
frequencies in the viral reads, offering the means to infer the multiple co-infecting sublineages. We
describe the Concerti computational framework for inferring phylogenies in each of the two scenarios.
To demonstrate the accuracy of the method, we reproduce some known results in both scenarios.
We also make some additional discoveries. We uncovered new potential parallel mutation in the
evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In the context of cancer, we uncovered new clones harboring
resistant mutations to therapy from clinically plausible phylogenetic tree in a patient.

Introduction

Deep sequencing genomic datasets contain intricate details that can be mined to reveal
intra-patient heterogeneity present in disease states. The classic example that has been
explored is the heterogeneity present in cancer, whether it be within a single tumor, across a

patient’s metastatic sites, or a tumor’s evolution in response to treatment over the course
of a disease. Interestingly, these same principles of heterogeneity can be explored in other
scenarios that have similar sequencing data demonstrating different variant frequencies,
including SARS-CoV-2 virus causing the COVID-19 infection. Evidence in several studies
have highlighted the intra-host genomic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 [10, 11, 15, 23, 27]. As
in cancer, the presence of different, heterogenic reads in a COVID-19 patient assumes the
existence of multiple sublineages, or subclones, rather than the occurrence of recombination.
Once these assumptions are established, the same tools and methodologies that are used
to analyze tumor heterogeneity can be applied with a level of confidence to SARS-COV-2
datasets.
Implications of viral heteroplasmy in COVID-19 patients. The novel SARS-Cov2 coronavirus that appeared in the city of Wuhan, China, in late 2019 has caused a large
scale COVID-19 pandemic, spreading to more than 70 countries. Broad sequencing efforts
have been made in an effort to understand the natural evolution of this virus. Several studies
published with SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data reveal different viral allele frequencies in the
same patient. The most likely explanation for the presence of intra-patient heterogenic viral
reads is the existence of different viral strains rather than recombination since the probability
of a fully functional single stranded virus emerging after entering a cell and its subsequent
disassembly and reassembly into a virion with a different sequence is low. Multiple viral
strains infecting the same host has enormous clinical implications in terms of treatment,
epidemiology, and the potential to overcome the pandemic and thus needs to be considered
and analyzed. Variations in viral strains can harbor different resistance mechanisms, levels of
transmissibility, response to therapy, and explain the large variation of symptomology. Even
more important, treatment and vaccine success would rely on targeting the collection of
strains present and not simply targeting one. It is for these reasons it is imperative that the
research community consider the likely scenario that patients are coinfected with multiple
strains.
Implications of heterogeneity in tumors of cancer patients. The presence of
multiple tumor clones in the same patient has significant treatment implications. Multiple
mechanisms of resistance can exist in separate clones [22]. Drug targets can ‘disappear’ or
develop over time [19, 26]. Alternate pathways can be inhibited by the introduction of new
alterations [29]. Even gross phenotypes can change due to underlying genomic changes [1].
Thus, it is imperative that we continue to monitor patient tumor evolution over the course
of a disease in order to optimize treatment protocols. Parallels of tumor evolution have been
drawn to that of human evolution and thus similar tools and algorithms are being applied
and adjusted to analyze cancer [21]. Phylogenetic trees are being constructed to capture the
change occurring during the disease while subclonal structure is identified and analyzed for
clinically relevant changes. Several algorithms have been proposed to capture tumor evolution
using single cells [12, 25] however these tools do not account for tumor heterogeneity and
thus do not pick up on all clones present in a given tumor. Most algorithms consider bulk
tumor samples which has the advantage of integrating genetic information from many tumor
cells but are challenged by the need to deconvolve the mixture of clones present in any given
biopsy [4, 5, 7, 16, 18, 24]. Several of these methods have been adapted for multi-site sample
integration but are not specific for longitudinal data [5, 9, 16, 18]. More recently there have
been several tools developed that do integrate longitudinal (multi-time) sampling [14, 20].
Although these models are more accurate, they still are limited by their inability to deal
with samples with large mutational burdens and are not designed for multi-site samples.

Concerti overview An informative analysis for SAR-CoV-2 would require a method
to be able to perform fine-grain evaluations with the ability to differentiate between viral
sequences. In addition, the method would need to be able to analyze longitudinal data to
capture when co-occurrence transpires. In cancer, sequential liquid biopsies over the course
of disease are becoming more common given the ease of collection, low cost, and greater
ability to describe the complete disease profile vs. a subset of mutations present in distinct
lesions. Therefore, it is imperative to establish tools that can manage/deconvolve mixed
clonal samples, integrate multi-site and longitudinal sampling, and analyze large numbers of
mutations with the same level of accuracy as low burden samples. We introduce Concerti a
tool for inferring disease evolution phylogenies, at genomic scales, from multiple sites and
multiple longitudinal DNA sequencing samples. One of the unique features of Concerti is
that it generates time-scaled trees, i.e., it captures not only the birth and death of clones
but also acquisition of alterations within the same clone over time. Concerti uses almost
exclusively discrete optimization methods and has the flexibility to provide multiple possible
solutions suggested by the patient data. To help with the interpretation of the results, the
solutions are ordered by decreasing likelihood. Due to the absence of benchmark data, it
is hard to perform a precise comparison of the different tools reported in literature. We
provide a succinct summary of the capabilities of six classes of exemplar tools and highlight
the elements of uniqueness in each approach. (Table 1).
We demonstrate the accuracy of Concerti by reproducing and expanding on known
results from literature. In particular, comparing with the results reported in [23] for the
viral evolution model and expanding on them by discovering new homoplasies, while for the
tumor evolution model using whole-exome sequencing data from patients [13, 22], Concerti
constructs phylogenetic trees that accurately describe a tumor’s evolution while simultaneously
highlighting new post-treatment subclones that likely confer resistance and may serve as new
potential drug targets.

Method

Viral Evolution Model. For computational purposes, we assume that all the virions of
the same lineage have the same set of alterations (with respect to a reference). Since there
is evidence of intra-patient variations with a wide range of allele frequencies [23, 28], we
postulate that there is heteroplasmy due to possibly multiple sublineages evolving in this
micro-environment. Since the coronavirus is a non-segmented positive RNA virus, we further
postulate that it is very unlikely that any recombination occurs during the virus’s life cycle:
attachment and entry, replicase protein expression, replication and transcription, assembly

and release [6].
Tumor Evolution Model. We assume the following model: tumors arise from an altered
cell, accumulating additional alterations over time. These changes give rise to populations
of cells termed in literature as clones. For computational purposes, we assume that all the
cells in a clone have the same set of alterations. Furthermore, these clones may alter further
over time. Thus multiple clones co-exist in a tumor and some may have an evolutionary
advantage over the others within the tumor environment, allowing for growth or shrinkage of
a clone over time.
Terminology. The absence of recombination and the accumulation of variants over time
are the two salient factors that facilitate a common methodology for both scenarios. We
address the problem of inferring the evolution be it the coronavirus from multiple patients or
tumor within a cancer patient. Furthermore for a cancer patient, the inferencing may be
based on single or multiple DNA sequencing samples: the latter can be multi-time, i.e., at
multiple timepoints, or can be multi-site, i.e., from different lesions possibly collected at the
same time. We simply use the term data point for multi-patient (COVID-19) and multi-time,
multi-site (cancer). The term alteration is applicable to any genetic event including, but not
limited to, mutations, SNVs, etc. In this manuscript CCF (Cancer Cell Fraction) denotes the
fraction of cancer cells bearing a mutation in a cancer sample [2]. For the purposes of our
algorithm, CCF and VAF (Variant Allele Frequency) are indistinguishable and the precise
method of determining alteration frequencies is outside the scope of this paper. For clarity
of exposition we use VAF, in place of CCF or VAF, and SNV, in place of general alteration.
Furthermore, in the context of cancer, it is important to note the distinction between
clones and pseudoclones. Clone is a biological entity and can be described as a population of
indistinguishable cells. For our purposes, the nuclear DNA is identical for the population
and thus a clone can be defined by a set of SNV’s (variant with respect to a reference or
normal sequence). A pseudoclone on the other hand is a subset of these SNV’s. In practice
they are a maximal collection of SNVs with identical (or similar) VAF values [18, 20, 24]:
this value is termed prevalence in this paper. This collection of SNVs is meaningful under the
assumption that identical VAF values implies these SNVs co-occur in a cell. Note that the
converse is not necessarily true, i.e., multiple SNVs within a cell may have varied VAF values.
Thus pseudoclone is an algorithmic artefact while a clone is simply the union of some finite
pseudoclones. For example in Fig. 4, the distinct colors denote the different pseudoclones,
but the biological clone is the union of all the subclones in the path to the root of the
evolutionary tree. Hence the (biological) brown clone in the subcutaneous soft tissue, for
instance, is actually the the union of the SNVs that define the brown pseudoclone, the orange
pseudoclone, the cyan pseudoclone and the green pseudoclone. Hence, for mathematical
preciseness, we use the term pseudoclones in the Method sections. To avoid clutter, we use
the term clone, in place of pseudoclone, in the Result Section.
With a slight abuse of terminologies, a pseudoclone corresponds to a sublineage in the
context of virions and a clone corresponds to a lineage. To avoid clutter, we use the terms
sublineage and lineage interchangeably.

state does not occur (no back mutation).

2. unique, i.e., the same alteration does not occur elsewhere in the tumor (no parallel
mutation).
The topology of the evolution is a tree. The Occam’s Razor Principle suggests the perfect
phylogeny assumptions used most commonly in literature [3]. However, it is important to
note that some exceptions to this property of alterations may occur in practice. This is
handled as an exception in our algorithm. These exceptions indicate parallel mutation. This
is also referred to as homplasy.
B Assumption 2. [Alteration distribution] Most of the alterations follow i.i.d. (uniform)
distribution.
Again, for algorithmic purposes, it is reasonable to assume that tumor clones would follow
the same principles as the individual alteration. But a clone, unlike an alteration, may
die, i.e., may be selected against and overrun by other clones. So a clone may change in
composition over time, i.e. more alterations can be added to the clone (but, not removed due
to Assumption 1) for a majority of the alterations. Different selection pressures are in effect
on the different clones, whose effect is manifested in the size of the clones: the clone can
either grow or shrink in size reflected as an increasing or decreasing CCF value respectively.
Thus the following:

189

B Assumption 3. [Tumor Clone dynamics] Over time, a clone may
1. change in composition / size (additional alterations but not lose alterations)
2. change in prevalence values (increase or decrease)
3. die or a new clone may be born.

See Fig. 1 for an overview of Concerti. Based on our assumptions, the method has two
major phases.
1. Phase I. We first identify the pseudoclones/sublineages across all the data-points. However, the pseudoclones are not identical due to the clonal dynamics (Assumption 3).
a. Due to Assumption 3(3), we gate the alterations that are present in all the samples.
This results in some alteration being filtered out and the step is called Negative Selection
in the outline. We cluster the filtered alterations separately for each sample.
b. The pseudoclones are preserved in the samples, albeit with some dynamics (Assumption 3(2)). We carry out a multi-dimensional clustering, across all samples, based on the
values or distributions of the alterations.
c. We appropriately merge the clusters of the above two steps to obtain the pseudoclones/sublineages.
2. Phase II. This has two steps: in the first we deduce the phylogenies of each sample
separately and in the second we relate them with each other.
a. The sizes of the pseudoclones/sublineages in each data-point admits possibly multiple
phylogenies. We enumerate the admissible phylogenies associating a probability with
each based on Assumption 2.
b. Next we consolidate the trees from the multiple data points. This captures the topology
as well as the clonal dynamics. Concerti offers two types of visualizations: one that
effectively captures the change-in-composition dynamics of the clones (as a tree) and the
other that captures the change-in-size and birth/death of clones effectively (fishplots [17]).
The multiple possible solutions suggested by the data is output in decreasing order of
probabilities, making it easier for interpreting the results.
Exception Handling. Real data is sometimes notoriously perplexing, either due to errors
in sample or CCF distribution estimation or simply the infraction of some of the assumptions
enumerated in the last section. In practice, in refractory cases we handle the exceptions by
relaxing the minimum of assumptions by consulting with the domain experts.

However, for algorithmic efficiency, we use the similarity measure defined as

sim(g1 , g2 ) = 1 − dis(g1 , g2 ).

where [0 <= l, u <= 1.0] is the maximal interval where both g1 and g2 have non-zero values.

removed. Let this set of filtered alterations be Sa . Let the remaining set of alterations be
Sb . We carry out a hierarchical clustering [8] of the alteration set Sb using the similarity

pseudoclones. The prevalence of a pseudoclone is approximated by the mean of the mean

Phase II: Generate Evolution Tree(s) of Pseudoclones/Sublineages
Enumerate Admissible Trees.

The question of how multiple sets of alterations (pseudoclones/sublineages) at a data point
stack up against each other is almost completely left to the computational methods.
Fig. 2 shows a simple example. Assume without loss of generality (WLOG) u=1.0.
Prevalence values 0 ≤ a, b ≤ 1 can be viewed as some sub-intervals (sticks) of [0, 1] of lengths
a and b respectively. Then in a cell-population realization either sticks A (with prevalence
value a) and B (with prevalence value b) are nested or disjoint but may not straddle. To
remove possible computational artefacts, pseudoclones with prevalence v < 0.05 and less
than 3 SNVs for all samples are discarded. Finally, given a pseudoclone A with a prevalence
value a, then for each x pseudoclone nested directly in A with prevalence vx , the sum of
P
their prevalence is x vx ≤ a. With bulk-sequencing (i.e. no viral isolates or single-cell),
the multiple possible scenarios cannot really be teased apart. But using Assumption 2, the
probability of each admissible tree can be estimated.
We present a recursive algorithm, called Stick-Stack (Algorithm 1), that enumerates all
possible ways of stacking the sticks (or sub-intervals) corresponding to pseudoclones/sublineage. The algorithm computes the probabilities of the trees using Assumption 2. In
the output of Stick-Stack (A, B) denotes nesting of B in A. Stick-Stack call is initiated as
(1, φ, pr = 1.0, v1 >...> vk ) with the n prevalence values of the k pseudoclones/sublineages
and the output is a set of trees where each tree tr is a collection of (parent,child) pairs, with
probability pr. It is easy to verify from the algorithm description below that the probabilities
of all the admissible trees sum up to 1.

While a single data point may suggest the relative relationship between pseudoclones, clonal

B Observation 1. [Clone Dynamics] Based on Assumption 3 the clusters of filtered
alterations of Step 1 of Phase I provide the clone dynamics.
a. If such a cluster merges with the multidimensional cluster, then this indicates a change
in composition of the pseudoclone and provides labels for the edges of the evolution
phylogeny.
b. If a new cluster is generated (i.e., it does not merge with clusters from the multidimensional clustering) then this indicates the birth of a new pseudoclone.
A clone acquiring new alterations (case a. above) is shown as asterisk in the tumor phylogeny
in Fig. 5 and 6. The birth and death of clones (case b. above) is also illustrated in the same
figure.
The mutual comparisons reveal whether the different samples are related or independent.
When related, it is possible to reconstruct consolidated tree(s) that capture the evolution across
the the multiple data points. Stick-Stack algorithm produces each tree as a set of two-tuples
corresponding to each edge as (parent,child), where the parent and child are both pseudoclones.
Formally, if there exist k > 0 parent-child pairs as (C0 , C1 ), (C1 , C2 ), ..., (Ck−1 , Ck ), then C0
precedes Ck or C0 ≺ Ck .
B Definition 1. [Incompatible] Let T1 and T2 be two trees with three sets of (possibly
empty) pseudoclones: Ai that occur in both T1 and T2 ; Di that occur in T1 , but not in T2 ,
and, Bi that occur in T2 but not in T1 .
T1 and T2 are incompatible if at least one of the following conditions does not hold:
1. WLOG if A1 ≺ A2 in T1 then A1 ≺ A2 T2 .
2. WLOG each Di is of the type (-, Di ) and if Di has a child then it occurs as (Di , Dj ) in
T1 .

3. WLOG each Bi is of the type (-, Bi ) and if Bi has a child then it occurs as (Bi , Bj ) in T2 .
Once all possible configurations of the pseudoclone for any given time point are generated
independently, the next step is to extract the possible compatible tree between all time
points.
B Definition 2. [Consolidated phylogeny] Let E(T ) be the set of the two tuples (parent,child) of T . If T1 , T2 , ..., TK are mutually compatible, then T, the consolidated phylogeny
of the K trees, is defined by the following set
E(T) = ∪K
k=1 E(Tk ).

290
291
292
293
294

Notice that by conditions 2 and 3 of the incompatible definition above, T does not have any
nodes with multiple parents and T is a tree.
Let Ti,j be the jth compatible tree at data point i with probability pi,j as estimated
by Stick-Stack. Then the the relative probability of a compatible evolution tree Tk =
(T1,j1 , T2,j1 , ..., Tn,j1 ) over the n data points is given by
p2,j

P
Note that k P(Tk ) = 1 where k is over all possible compatible configurations. Thus the
probability of a Tk may be underestimated. However, it preserves the ordering of the possible
multiple solutions which is used here.
For a concrete example, consider Fig. 4. The four sites are labeled as subcutaneous soft
tissue (subcu), brain, liver1 and liver2. For each site, Concerti produces exactly one tree,
with eight pseudoclones across all the four sites: green (G), cyan (C), orange (O), purple (P),
ash (A), yellow (Y), red (R), brown (B). Then Stick-Stack produces the following four trees:

303

Tsubcu

= {(G,C), (C,O), (O,B)},

304

Tbrain

= {(G,C), (C,O), (O,A)},

305

Tliver1

= {(G,C), (C,P), (P,Y)},

306

Tliver2

= {(G,C), (C,P), (P,R)}.

307
308

It can be verified that the four trees are mutually compatible. Then the unique consolidated
phylogeny is given by
T = Tsubcu ∪ Tbrain ∪ Tliver1 ∪ Tliver2
= {(G,C), (C,O), (O,B),(O,A),(C,P), (P,Y),(P,R)}

T has only one connected component suggesting that all the data points are genetically
related.
In multi-time data, a consolidated tree T is stretched out with the given time points
appropriately marking the tree (see Figs.5, 6 for example). Additionally, a fishplot is output
to visualize the dynamics of the pseudoclones (growth or shrinkage, including birth and
death).

Concerti: phylogenomics

Figure 3 The 21 COVID-19 patients are shown at different internal and leaf nodes in the
phylogeny as stacked disks of different colors. Each color corresponds to a distinct sublineage
identified by a set of alterations and the size is roughly proportional to its observed prevalence value.
Where possible, the edges of the phylogeny are colored by the emerging sublineage(s). When a node
has multiple individuals, it indicates that there is not enough evidence to delineate the distinctions
in the phylogeny. The three homoplasies (parallel mutations) are shown by dashed transversal lines.
While in two (raspberry, green colors) the alteration event occurred at least twice, in the third (gray
color) the alteration occurred at least three times. Furthermore, if the date of collection of a sample
at a child node precedes the date at a parent node, it is within a window of a week.

COVID-19 data

For our study we sought COVID-19 patient samples with access to the raw reads in order to
assess the alterations at varying allele frequencies. Using an established reference MN908947.3
obtained from the ‘first’ patient sequenced in Wuhan, we found forty one distinct variants
in twenty one patient samples (see the Data Availability Section for details on the patient
samples and the variant calling pipeline). Eighteen of the patients were also analyzed in [23],
albeit the variants therein were derived based on a different reference sequence and protocol.
Hence, the set of variants do not exactly match the set we obtain. Our data set has three
additional patients (who are sellers or deliverymen from the Wuhan seafood market) [30].
We applied Concerti to the data and the resulting phylogeny is shown in Fig. 3. Note that
all samples with dark blue sublineage in the figure were collected in the USA, the one with
the dark-grey sublineage (SRR11278092) was collected in Nepal, while the remaining were
collected in China. The figure shows the other lineages that were identified. The phylogeny
is not fully resolved based on the variants of this set of patients; this is shown as clusters of
patients in two internal and one leaf node in the tree. The phylogeny also uncovers three
parallel mutation events (shown as transversal dashed lines with the corresponding color):
404:A>T (raspberry), 29039:A>T (grey) and 4229:A>C (green). The first two were reported

Using Concerti, we analyzed three patients, one sampled across multiple sites (Fig. 4)
and two sampled over time (Figs. 5 and 6). We first applied Concerti to a multi-site case,
GI1, a 53 year old male with metastatic colon cancer who was part of a rapid autopsy study
where multiple metastatic samples were taken at the time of death. Additional clinical
details and the description of the sequencing method can be found in [22]. Samples were
taken from different anatomical sites including lesions in the liver, brain, and subcutaneous
soft tissue. Time of lesion development was not documented radiologically and thus no
longitudinal time-ordering of the samples could be performed. Concerti’s generated tumor
evolution tree gives a clinically plausible explanation as to the mutational development of
this disease (Fig. 4). The phylogenetic tree characterizes several truncal clones shared across
all samples (green and cyan) and then identifies two sibling clones (orange and purple) that
are tissue specific. One clone captures both liver samples and contains the KRAS p.G12S
allele. The other clone, which contains the ELF3 p.S229R allele, goes on to develop two
daughter clones each specific to the brain or subcutaneous soft tissue. Thus, Concerti’s
integration of multi-site samples enables the phylogenetic tree to capture a tumor’s broad
spatial heterogeneity and allows for a treatment course to be designed to be locally or broadly
targeted.
We also applied Concerti to longitudinal sequencing data from two relapsed chronic
lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients. Patient CLL1 had five biopsies taken over the course
of treatment with ibrutinib and rituximab and relapsed 12 months after treatment initiation
(Fig. 5). Before treatment, the dominant clone contained mutations in several known cancer
genes including TP53, MED12, IK2F3, and NOTCH1. Two small clones (red asterisks)
continued to evolve as evidenced by the acquisition of additional mutations after two months

post-treatment. The fishplot highlights the correspondence between the emergence of a
resistant clones and the increase in tumor size. Concerti’s time-scaled phylogenetic tree
and fishplot captures the birth of this clone, before relapse was clinically documented, that
harbored three mutations in genes associated with resistance to ibrutinib, including BTK,
PLCG2, and known cancer driver CCND2.
The second CLL patient Concerti analyzed was similarly treated with and developed
resistance to ibrutinib. (Fig. 6). For patient CLL2, seven blood biopsies were taken over the
treatment course including before-treatment, on-treatment, and at time of relapse. Several
truncal mutations in known cancer genes were identified in the pre-treatment samples,
including TP53 and FBXW7. After initiation with ibrutinib, a clone with a BIRC3 mutation
(green) increased in prevalence. At the time of relapse, Concerti’s phylogenetic tree identifies
the emergence of a new clone harboring a mutation in PLCG2, a known mechanism of
resistance to ibrutinib therapy, and which goes on to grow in prevalence. Clones with ATM
and SF3B1 did not have noticeable clonal dynamics during the treatment or relapse intervals
suggesting they are not selected for under ibrutinib therapy. In both CLL patients, the birth

Conclusion

In this paper we introduce Concerti, an algorithm for inferring evolutionary phylogenies.
Concerti’s ability to extract and integrate information from multi-point, whether multisite, multi-time, or combination thereof samples, enables the discovery of clinically plausible
phylogenetic trees that capture the heterogeneity known to exist both spatially and temporally.
These models can have direct therapeutic implications since they can highlight: “births”
of clones that may harbor resistance mechanisms to treatment, “death” of subclones with
drug targets, and acquisition on functionally pertinent mutations in clones that may have
seemed clinically irrelevant. We demonstrate in this paper how Concerti can be applied to
any genomic sequencing dataset with varying allele frequencies, whether it be cancer or the
new SAR-Cov-2 virus causing the Covid-19 pandemic, and the results can have profound
disease-specific clinical implication.

Identifying the presence of multiple viral strain infecting a single host can have significant
impact on how we approach treatment, vaccine development, and mitigation strategies. The
results for Covid-19 patients demonstrate Concerti’s ability to distinguish between viral strains
based on difference allele frequencies and discover the presence of new homoplasies. Thus,
Concerti’s results addresses the overwhelming challenges researches face when developing
therapeutics and may help facilitate the key to effective vaccine development. Accurately
monitoring tumor evolution over the course of a disease can lead to the identification of
new drug targets and therapeutic approaches that can stabilize this complex disease and
manage the selective pressures introduced by treatment exposure and tumor-environment
changes. These results for patients CLL1, CLL2 and GI1 demonstrate how Concerti’s specific
integration of multi-point data can facilitate better treatment plans that can both be more
locally targeted and optimized for treatment responsivity.

All data used in the paper are available with the original publications. In particular,
patient CLL1 and CLL2 correspond to B06 and A43 of [13], respectively. While the GI1
colon cancer patient used for the multi-site analysis was previously published as TPS037
in [22]. The COVID-19 patient data come from 5 NCBI BioProjects: PRJNA601736,
PRJNA603194, PRJNA610428, PRJNA605983 and PRJNA608651. The reads were trimmed
with Trimmomatic (v. 0.39) and then mapped with bwa on MN908947.3 GenBank sequence.
This sequence was taken in December from a 57 year old woman, who sold shrimp at the
Wuhuan seafood market, appears to be the earliest case with COVID-19. Variant calling was
performed generating mpileup files using SAMtools and then running VarScan (min-var-freq
parameter set to 0.01). Finally to remove possibly sequencing artifacts, we retains SNV
that: showing a VarScan significance p-value < 0.05 (Fisher’s Exact Test on the read counts
supporting reference and variant alleles) and VAF>10%, resulting in a list of 41 SNVs in 21
patients that are used in the paper. Concerti’s binaries are available upon request.
