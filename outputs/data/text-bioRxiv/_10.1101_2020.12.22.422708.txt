Abstract: Newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of an ongoing global pandemic leading to severe

28

respiratory disease in humans. SARS-CoV-2 targets epithelial cells in the respiratory tract and lungs,

29

which can lead to amplified chloride secretion and increased leak across epithelial barriers, contributing

30

to severe pneumonia and consolidation of the lungs as seen in many COVID-19 patients. There is an

31

urgent need for a better understanding of the molecular aspects that contribute to SARS-CoV-2-

32

induced pathogenesis and for the development of approaches to mitigate these damaging pathologies.

33

The multifunctional SARS-CoV-2 Envelope (E) protein contributes to virus assembly/egress, and as a

34

membrane protein, also possesses viroporin channel properties that may contribute to epithelial barrier

35

damage, pathogenesis, and disease severity. The extreme C-terminal (ECT) sequence of E also

36

contains a putative PDZ-domain binding motif (PBM), similar to that identified in the E protein of SARS-

37

CoV-1. Here, we screened an array of GST-PDZ domain fusion proteins using either a biotin-labeled

38

WT or mutant ECT peptide from the SARS-CoV-2 E protein. Notably, we identified a singular specific

39

interaction between the WT E peptide and the second PDZ domain of human Zona Occludens-1 (ZO1),

40

one of the key regulators of TJ formation/integrity in all epithelial tissues. We used homogenous time

41

resolve fluorescence (HTRF) as a second complementary approach to further validate this novel

42

modular E-ZO1 interaction. We postulate that SARS-CoV-2 E interacts with ZO1 in infected epithelial

43

cells, and this interaction may contribute, in part, to tight junction damage and epithelial barrier

44

compromise in these cell layers leading to enhanced virus spread and severe respiratory dysfunction

45

that leads to morbidity. Prophylactic/therapeutic intervention targeting this virus-host interaction may

46

effectively reduce airway barrier damage and mitigate virus spread.

Introduction: Members of the Coronaviridae family are enveloped with a positive-sense single-

54

stranded RNA genome and helical nucleocapsid [1]. While symptoms in other mammalian species vary,

55

most coronaviruses cause mild respiratory disease in humans [2-4]. However, a highly pathogenic

56

human coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1), emerged in 2003

57

to cause acute respiratory disease in afflicted individuals [5, 6]. Moreover, in December 2019, SARS-

58

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged as the etiological agent of severe respiratory disease, now

59

called Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), first identified in patients in Wuhan, Hubei province,

60

China. This initial outbreak has now become a global pandemic and has afflicted over 71 million people

61

and claimed over 1.6 million lives worldwide as of December 2020. The most common symptoms of

62

COVID-19 patients include fever, malaise, dry cough, and dyspnea with severe cases requiring

63

mechanical ventilation in intensive care unit (ICU) facilities for profound acute hypoxemic respiratory

64

failure [7-10]. Therefore, it is imperative to investigate how this novel SARS-CoV-2 interacts with the

65

host to cause such severe disease pathology.

66

The Spike (S), Membrane (M), Nucleocapsid (N), and Envelope (E) proteins are the four virion

67

structural proteins that are encoded within the 3′ end of the viral RNA genome. The S protein is

68

responsible for entry and membrane fusion. The M protein is most abundant and gives the virion its

69

shape, while the N protein binds and protects the viral genome as part of the nucleocapsid [2, 11]. The

70

multifunctional E protein plays roles in virion maturation, assembly, and egress, and the E protein of

71

SARS-CoV-1 plays a crucial role in infection as shown by attenuated virulence in vivo by a SARS CoV-

72

1 virus lacking the E protein. The extreme C-terminal amino acids of the E protein of SARS-CoV-1

73

contain an important virulence factor, a PDZ domain binding motif (PBM), whose deletion reduces viral

74

virulence [11-13]. Notably, the PBM of SARS-CoV-1 E protein interacts with the PDZ domain of host

75

protein PALS1, a TJ-associated protein, leading to delayed formation of cellular TJs and disruption of

76

cell polarity in a renal epithelial model [14]. Intriguingly, the extreme C-terminal (ECT) sequence of the

77

E protein of SARS-CoV-2 is similar to that of SARS-CoV-1, suggesting that it may also interact with

78

specific host PDZ-domain bearing proteins via this putative PBM. Indeed, recent studies showed that

79

the SARS-CoV-2 E protein exhibited an increased affinity for PALS1 [9, 15].

80

We sought to determine whether the ECT of SARS-CoV-2 E protein engages specific host PDZ-

81

domain bearing TJ proteins, which may function to enhance disease progression and severity. To this

82

end, we probed a GST-fused array of approximately 100 mammalian PDZ-domains fixed on solid

83

support with biotin-labeled WT or C-terminal mutant peptides from SARS-CoV-2 E protein. Surprisingly,

84

we identified a single, robust and specific interaction between the WT E peptide and PDZ-domain #2

85

of human Zona Occludens-1 (ZO1), but not between the C-terminal mutant E peptide and ZO1. ZO1 is

86

a key scaffolding protein that organizes the formation and integrity of TJ complexes via its three PDZ

87

domains that promote multiple protein-protein interactions. Specifically, PDZ-domain #2 of ZO1 is

88

necessary to establish the characteristic continuous band of ZO1 and the TJ barrier proteins, occludin

89

and claudin-2, that is critical for the establishment of normal barrier function across an epithelium [16-

90

18, 31]. We confirmed the E-ZO1 interaction by HTRF once again demonstrating that GST-PDZ domain

91

#2 of ZO1 bound to SARS-CoV-2 E WT peptide, but not with the E mutant peptide, in a concentration

92

dependent manner.

93

Since severe pneumonia and consolidation of the lungs are often symptoms of COVID-19 [7, 8], it

94

is tempting to speculate that the SARS-CoV-2 E protein may interact with host ZO1 to disrupt or

95

damage TJ complexes and barrier function in human airway epithelial barrier cells as a mechanism to

96

enhance virus spread and disease severity. Further investigations into the interaction between SARS-

97

CoV-2 E protein and ZO1 would improve our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 virus-induced lung

98

morbidity and could be utilized to focus treatment strategies. The putative E/ZO1 interface may prove

99

to be a druggable target, and thus serve to therapeutically reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission or disease

100

pathology.

Materials and Methods:

105

Mammalian PDZ-domain array screen. The PDZ domain array consisted of 90 known PDZ domains

106

and nine 14-3-3-like domains from mammalian proteins expressed in duplicate as purified GST fusion

107

proteins in lettered boxes A-J. SARS-CoV-2 E WT (Biotin-SRVKNLNSSRVPDLLV-COOH) or ECT

108

mutant (Biotin-SRVKNLNSSRVPAAAA-COOH) biotinylated peptides (100ug each) were fluorescently

109

labeled and used to screen the specially prepared C-terminal reading array. Fluorescent spots are

110

indicative of a positive peptide-protein interaction.

111
112

Homogenous Time Resolve Fluorescence (HTRF). The binding of SARS-CoV-2 WT and ECT mutant

113

E peptides (see above) to purified GST-PDZ domain #2 of ZO1 was assessed using HTRF. Both the

114

protein and the biotinylated peptides were serially diluted 1:2 in assay buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4,

115

150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.005% Tween-20) and pre-bound for 30 min to either anti-GST-terbium

116

conjugated HTRF donor antibody or streptavidin conjugated to d2 HTRF acceptor (CisBio). Serial

117

dilutions of protein and peptides were then incubated together in a matrix format in a final volume of 10

118

uL in a white, medium binding, low volume 384-well plate. Following a 1 hr incubation, the HTRF signal

119

was measured using the ClarioStar plate reader (BMG Lab Tech). Data for the WT peptide was fit to a

120

one-site saturation binding model using XlFit (IDBS).

122

Expression and Purification of GST-ZO1-PDZ-2 fusion protein. Expression and purification of GST

123

fusion protein from pGEX-ZO1-2/3 plasmid was performed as described previously [19, 20]. Briefly, the

124

plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells and single colonies were cultured in 10ml of

125

LB media overnight with shaking at 37°C. The overnight culture was added into 100ml of fresh LB broth

126

and grown at 37°C for one hour with shaking. GST alone or GST-PDZ domain fusion proteins were

127

induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) (0.1 mM) for 4 h at 30°C. Bacterial cultures

128

were centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C, and lysates were extracted by using B-PER bacterial

129

protein extract reagent according to the protocol supplied by the manufacturer (Pierce). Fusion proteins

were purified with glutathione-Sepharose 4B and eluted with elution buffer (100 mM Tris-Cl [pH 8.0],

131

120 mM NaCl, 30 mM reduced glutathione). Purified proteins were analyzed on SDS-PAGE gels and

stained with Coomassie blue and quantified.

Results:

135

Comparison of C-terminal sequences of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 E proteins. The SARS-CoV E

136

protein is a small membrane protein that has multiple functions in infected cells and is incorporated into

137

mature virions [21-24]. The E protein can be divided into 3 major regions including N-terminal, trans-

138

membrane, and C-terminal domains (Fig. 1). In addition, the extreme C-terminal amino acids of SARS-

139

CoV-1 E (DLLV) comprise a validated PDZ-domain binding motif (Fig. 1, red). Since the DLLV core

140

motif is perfectly conserved in the SARS-CoV-2 E protein (Wuhan-Hu-1 strain), and the immediately

141

adjacent amino acids, although not identical, are highly conserved with those of SARS-CoV-1 E (Fig.

142

1), the likelihood that SARS-CoV-2 E protein can also interact with select PDZ-domains of host proteins

143

is high [14, 24-26].

144
145

Identification of ZO1 as a PDZ-domain interactor with the E protein of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we sought

146

to determine whether the putative PBM present within the SARS-CoV-2 E protein could interact with a

147

wide-array of host PDZ-domain containing proteins. We used fluorescently-labeled, biotinylated

148

peptides containing WT or mutated C-terminal sequences from the SARS-CoV-2 E protein to screen

149

an array composed of 90 PDZ-domains and 9 14-3-3-like domains derived from mammalian proteins

150

to detect novel host interactors (Fig. 2, top). Surprisingly, we identified a singular specific interaction

151

between the SARS-CoV-2 WT E peptide and the second PDZ-domain of human ZO1 (Fig. 2, bottom

152

left panel, red oval, position J6). As a control, the SARS-CoV-2 mutant E peptide did not interact with

153

any of the PDZ- or 14-3-3-domains present on the array (Fig. 2, bottom middle panel). All GST fusion

154

proteins were present on the array as indicated by the use of anti-GST antiserum (Fig. 2, bottom right

panel). To our knowledge, these results are the first to identify PDZ-domain #2 of human ZO1 as an

156

interactor with the C-terminal sequences of SARS-CoV-2 E protein.

157
158

Use of Homogenous Time Resolve Fluorescence (HTRF) to confirm the E-ZO1 interaction.

159

We sought to use a second, complementary approach to validate the E-ZO1 interaction identified in

160

our screening array. Toward this end, we used an HTRF assay to assess the binding of SARS-CoV-2

161

WT and ECT mutant E peptides to purified GST-ZO1 PDZ domain #2 (Fig. 3). Serial dilutions of GST-

162

ZO1 PDZ-domain protein and WT or mutant E peptides were incubated together for 1 hour, and the

163

HTRF signal was measured and plotted using XIFit. Indeed, we observed a clear concentration

164

dependent binding of GST-ZO1 PDZ domain #2 to WT (Fig. 3, left panel), but not the ECT mutant (Fig.

165

3, right panel), E peptide over a range of peptide concentrations. The Kd of the interaction between the

166

SARS-CoV-2 WT E peptide and a 3nM concentration of GST-ZO1 PDZ domain #2 was 29nM (Fig. 3,

167

bottom panel), which is consistent with that calculated for PDZ domains and their cognate peptides.

168

These findings confirm those described above indicating that the C-terminal sequences of SARS-CoV-

169

2 E protein interact robustly with PDZ-domain #2 of human ZO1 protein.

170
171

Discussion.

172

The coronavirus E protein has many functions during infection, including the assembly, budding, and

173

intracellular trafficking of infectious virions from the ER-Golgi complex. Modeling of the SARS-CoV-2 E

174

protein suggests that E can form a broadly cation selective ion channel with dynamic open and closed

175

states, and therefore may act as a viroporin similar to the SARS-CoV-1 E protein [21, 28]. Although the

176

genome of SARS-CoV-2 only shares about 80% identity with that of SARS-CoV-1, the ECT of the

177

SARS-CoV-2 E protein, including the DLLV core motif and adjacent amino acids, are highly conserved

178

with those of SARS-CoV-1 E protein [21-23, 25, 27] (Fig. 1). Sequence alignment of the SARS-CoV-1

179

and SARS-CoV-2 E proteins (Fig 1) highlight the sequence similarities and the putative PBM located

180

at the ECT in both proteins.

181

We utilized a screening array to identify possible host PDZ-domain containing proteins that may

182

interact with the putative PBM of the SARS-CoV-2 E protein. Excitingly, we identified a single positive

183

hit, PDZ domain #2 of TJ scaffolding protein ZO1 (Fig 2). We confirmed this novel interaction between

184

the SARS-CoV-2 E WT peptide and purified GST-PDZ domain #2 of ZO1 using HTRF (Fig 3). To our

185

knowledge, these data are the first to identify PDZ-domain #2 of ZO1 as an interactor with the ECT of

186

the SARS-CoV-2 E protein.

187

There is precedent for coronavirus E proteins interacting with host PDZ domains. Indeed, the SARS-

188

CoV-1 E protein was shown to interact with the PDZ domain of TJ protein PALS1, resulting in

189

mislocalization of PALS1 and delayed formation of TJs in a renal model. In a subsequent study, the C-

190

terminal sequences of SARS-CoV-2 E protein were also predicted to bind to the PDZ domain of PALS1

191

[14, 15]. We did not detect an E-PALS1 interaction, since the PDZ domain of PALS1 was not included

192

in the screening array (Fig 2). In addition, PDZ-domain #2 of ZO2 and ZO3 proteins were also missing

193

from our screening array. Importantly, the second PDZ domains of ZO1, ZO2, and ZO3 are fairly-well

194

conserved in their structures, and they homo- and/or hetero-dimerize to form functional multi-

195

component complexes of ZO proteins in tight junctions. Therefore, we speculate that the second PDZ

196

domains of ZO2 and ZO3 would also interact positively with the ECT of the SARS-CoV-2 E protein.

197

Several pathogens, including respiratory viruses, may cause breakdown of cellular barriers (as well

198

as cell polarity and tissue-specific unidirectional transport processes) in the lung by a mechanism

199

involving an interaction between the virus and lung epithelial cell TJs to induce leak. These pathogens

200

can interact with cellular proteins comprising TJ complexes, thereby causing their disruption and

201

subsequently enhancing systemic virus spread across epithelial and endothelial barriers [29, 30] (Fig.

202

4). There are several independent mechanisms by which an E-ZO1 interaction may disrupt TJs, barrier

203

integrity, physiologically vital transcellular transport processes, and possibly cell polarity. For example,

204

SARS-CoV-2 E protein may compete with other proteins of the TJ complex (e.g. ZO2, ZO3, or ZO1

205

itself [homodimerizing]) for binding to PDZ domain #2 of ZO1, leading to the inability of claudins to

206

organize into actual barrier-forming strands [18]. Alternatively, an E-ZO1 interaction could potentially

207

alter ZO1 binding to actin filaments of the actin-myosin ring, thereby altering barrier regulation through

208

myosin light chain kinase signaling. In addition, an E-ZO1 interaction at the TJ complex could result in

209

a decreased affinity for ZO1 binding to ZONAB (ZO1-associated nucleic acid binding protein),

210

dislocating ZONAB from the TJ complex and increasing ZONAB translocation to the nucleus, leading

211

to an increase of epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) and a concomitant decrease in epithelial

212

barrier function (as well as unidirectional chloride secretion) through general epithelial dedifferentiation

213

[31-33].

214

By disrupting TJ integrity, the E-ZO1 interaction would result in increased paracellular transepithelial

215

leak as well as altered unidirectional transcellular salt and water transport, contributing to accumulation

216

of water in the lungs of COVID19 patients. In fact, a recent study shows that SARS-CoV-2 infection

217

disrupts ZO1 localization, and causes barrier dysfunction as demonstrated by a decrease in

218

transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) [34]. The authors speculate that this decrease in barrier

219

function in infected cells may be due to cytokine release in a secondary inflammatory response. It

220

remains to be determined whether an E-ZO1 interaction represents a more primary mechanism that

221

contributes to this observed decrease in barrier function and altered localization of ZO1 in infected cells

222

as described above.

223

Ongoing studies will determine whether full length SARS-CoV-2 E interacts with endogenous ZO1

224

in virus infected cells, in an effort to establish the biological significance of this virus-host interaction. In

225

addition, experiments are underway with lentivirus particles engineered to express the SARS-CoV-2

226

WT and mutant E proteins alone in human lung airway cells (Calu-3 and 16HBE) in order to investigate

227

the E/ZO1 interaction in isolation and its potential effect on TJ integrity via TEER analysis and

228

transepithelial diffusion of paracellular probe molecules. Validation of the E/ZO1 interaction in virus

229

infected cells will be important for future development of small molecule compounds to therapeutically

230

lessen lung morbidity and disease symptoms in severe COVID19 patients. Targeting the E/ZO1

231

interface for treatment may effectively reduce airway barrier cell damage and diminish the morbidity

232

and mortality associated with this major health threat.

Fig. 3. Homogenous Time Resolve Fluorescence (HTRF). The concentration dependent binding

261

properties of SARS-CoV-2 E-WT (Bt-WT peptide, left panel) and E-mutant (Bt-Mut peptide, right panel)

262

peptides with purified GST-PDZ domain #2 of ZO1 are shown. Concentrations of the GST-PDZ domain

263

fusion protein ranging from 0-50 nM (indicated by the various symbols) were incubated with the

264

indicated concentrations of E-WT (left) or E-mutant (right) peptides (x-axis), and the HTRF signal was

265

measured. The E-WT peptide did not bind to GST alone (left panel, blue dots); however, clear

266

concentration dependent binding of the E-WT peptide to GST-PDZ domain 2 of ZO1 was observed.

267

The E-mutant peptide did not bind to any concentration of GST-PDZ domain 2 of ZO1 tested (right

268

panel). A Kd value of 29nM was calculated for E-WT peptide binding to 3nM concentration of GST-ZO1

269

PDZ domain #2 (bottom panel).
