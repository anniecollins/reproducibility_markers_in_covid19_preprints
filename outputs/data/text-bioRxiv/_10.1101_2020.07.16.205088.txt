SUMMARY

28

The Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic has made deployment of an effective vaccine a

29

global health priority. We evaluated the protective activity of a chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored

30

vaccine encoding a pre-fusion stabilized spike protein (ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S) in challenge

31

studies with Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and mice

32

expressing the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor. Intramuscular dosing of ChAd-

33

SARS-CoV-2-S induces robust systemic humoral and cell-mediated immune responses and

34

protects against lung infection, inflammation, and pathology but does not confer sterilizing

35

immunity, as evidenced by detection of viral RNA and induction of anti-nucleoprotein antibodies

36

after SARS-CoV-2 challenge. In contrast, a single intranasal dose of ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S

37

induces high levels of systemic and mucosal IgA and T cell responses, completely prevents

38

SARS-CoV-2 infection in the upper and lower respiratory tracts, and likely confers sterilizing

39

immunity in most animals. Intranasal administration of ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S is a candidate for

40

preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission, and curtailing pandemic spread.

INTRODUCTION

42

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a positive-sense

43

single-stranded RNA virus that was first isolated in late 2019 from patients with severe respiratory

44

illness in Wuhan, China (Zhou et al., 2020b). As a betacoronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 is related to two

45

other highly pathogenic respiratory viruses, SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome

46

coronavirus (MERS-CoV). SARS-CoV-2 infection results in a clinical syndrome, Coronavirus

47

Disease 2019 (COVID-19) that can progress to respiratory failure (Guan et al., 2020) and also

48

present with cardiac pathology, gastrointestinal disease, coagulopathy, and a hyperinflammatory

49

syndrome (Cheung et al., 2020; Mao et al., 2020; Wichmann et al., 2020). The elderly,

50

immunocompromised, and those with co-morbidities (e.g., obesity, diabetes, and hypertension)

51

are at greatest risk of death from COVID-19 (Zhou et al., 2020a). Virtually all countries and

52

territories have been affected with more than twelve million infections to date, hundreds of

53

thousands of deaths, and a case-fatality rate estimated at ~4%. Most cases are spread by direct

54

human-to-human and droplet contact with substantial transmission in asymptomatic or mildly

55

symptomatic individuals

56

mortality, and destabilizing socioeconomic consequences of COVID-19 highlight the urgent need

57

for deployment of an effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine to mitigate the severity of infection, curb

58

transmission, end the pandemic, and prevent its return.

(Furukawa et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020). The extensive morbidity,

59

The SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome is approximately 30,000 nucleotides in length. The 5’ two-

60

thirds encode nonstructural proteins that enable genome replication and viral RNA synthesis. The

61

remaining one-third encode structural proteins such as spike (S), envelope, membrane, and

62

nucleoprotein (NP) that form the spherical virion, and accessory proteins that regulate cellular

63

responses. The S protein forms homotrimeric spikes on the virion and engages the cell-surface

64

receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to promote coronavirus entry into human cells

65

(de Wit et al., 2016; Letko et al., 2020). The SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 S proteins are cleaved

66

sequentially during the entry process to yield S1 and S2 fragments, followed by further processing

67

of S2 to yield a smaller S2' protein (Hoffmann et al., 2020). The S1 protein includes the receptor

68

binding domain (RBD) and the S2 protein promotes membrane fusion. The structure of a soluble,

69

stabilized prefusion form of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein was solved by cryo-electron microscopy,

70

revealing considerable similarity to the SARS-CoV S protein (Wrapp et al., 2020b). This form of

71

the S protein is recognized by potently neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (Cao et al., 2020; Pinto

72

et al., 2020; Zost et al., 2020) and could serve as a promising vaccine target.

73

Release of the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence prompted academic, government, and

74

industry groups to immediately begin developing vaccine candidates that principally targeted the

75

viral S protein (Burton and Walker, 2020). Multiple platforms have been developed to deliver the

76

SARS-CoV-2 S protein including DNA plasmid, lipid nanoparticle encapsulated mRNA,

77

inactivated virion, and viral-vectored vaccines (Graham, 2020). Several vaccines have entered

78

clinical trials to evaluate safety, and some have advanced to trials assessing immunogenicity and

79

efficacy. Because of the urgency of the pandemic, most vaccines advanced to human testing

80

without substantive efficacy data in animals (Diamond and Pierson, 2020). This circumstance

81

occurred in part because vaccine design and development has outpaced the generation of

82

accessible pre-clinical disease models of SARS-CoV-2 infection and pathogenesis.

83

Adenovirus (Ad)-based vaccines against betacoronaviruses have been evaluated

84

previously. A single dose of a chimpanzee Ad-vectored vaccine encoding the full-length S protein

85

of MERS-CoV protected human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (hDPP4) transgenic mice from infection

86

(Munster et al., 2017), reduced virus shedding and enhanced survival in camels (Alharbi et al.,

87

2019), and was safe and immunogenic in humans in a phase 1 clinical trial (Folegatti et al., 2020).

88

A human Ad-based vaccine expressing a MERS S1-CD40L fusion protein also was protective in

89

transgenic hDPP4 mice (Hashem et al., 2019). An Ad-based SARS-CoV vaccine expressing a

90

full-length S protein prevented pneumonia in ferrets after challenge and was highly immunogenic

91

in rhesus macaques (Kobinger et al., 2007). A chimpanzee Ad vector (Y25, a simian Ad-23 (Dicks

92

et al., 2012)) encoding the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 S protein (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) is currently

under evaluation in humans as a single intramuscular injection (NCT04324606). Preliminary pre-

97

Here, we develop and evaluate a different chimpanzee Ad (simian AdV-36)-based SARS-

98

CoV-2 vaccine (ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S) encoding a pre-fusion stabilized spike (S) protein after

99

introducing two proline substitutions in the S2 subunit (Pallesen et al., 2017). Intramuscular

100

administration of ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S induced robust systemic humoral and cell-mediated

101

immune responses against the S protein. One or two vaccine doses protected against lung

102

infection, inflammation, and pathology after SARS-CoV-2 challenge of mice that transiently

103

express the human ACE2 (hACE2) receptor. Despite the induction of high levels of neutralizing

104

antibody in serum, neither dosing regimen completely protected against SARS-CoV-2 infection,

105

as substantial levels of viral RNA were still detected in the lung. In comparison, when we

106

administered a single dose of ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S by the intranasal route, we detected high

107

levels of neutralizing antibody and anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA, and complete protection against

108

infection in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts. Moreover, and in contrast to the control

109

ChAd vaccine, 8 days after SARS-CoV-2 challenge, serum antibody responses to the SARS-

110

CoV-2 NP protein were absent in animals immunized with ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S via intranasal

111

delivery. Thus, ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S has the potential to confer sterilizing immunity at the site of

112

inoculation, which should prevent both virus-induced disease and transmission.

RESULTS

114

Chimpanzee Ad-vectored vaccine induces robust antibody responses against anti-

115

SARS-CoV-2. We constructed two replication-incompetent ChAd vectors based on a simian Ad-

116

36 virus. The ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S vector encodes the full-length sequence of SARS-CoV-2 S

117

protein as a transgene including the ectodomain, transmembrane domain, and cytoplasmic

118

domain (GenBank: QJQ84760.1) and is stabilized in pre-fusion form by two proline substitutions

119

at residues K986 and V987 (Pallesen et al., 2017; Wrapp et al., 2020a). The ChAd-control has no

120

transgene. The S protein transgene is controlled transcriptionally by a cytomegalovirus promoter.

121

To make the vector replication-incompetent and enhance packaging capacity, we replaced the

122

E1A/B genes and introduced a deletion in the E3B gene, respectively (Fig 1A). To confirm that

123

the S protein was expressed and antigenically intact, we transduced 293T cells and confirmed

124

binding of a panel of 22 neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against the S protein by flow cytometry

125

(Fig 1B).

126

To assess the immunogenicity of ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S, groups of 4-week-old BALB/c

127

mice were immunized by intramuscular inoculation with 1010 virus particles of ChAd-SARS-CoV-

128

2-S or ChAd-control. Some mice received a booster dose four weeks later. Serum samples were

129

collected 21 days after primary or booster immunization (Fig 1C), and IgG responses against

130

purified S and RBD proteins were evaluated by ELISA. Whereas ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S induced

131

high levels of S- and RBD-specific IgG, low, if any levels were detected in the ChAd-control-

132

immunized mice (Fig 1D and S1A). Serum samples were assayed in vitro for neutralization of

133

infectious SARS-CoV-2 using a focus-reduction neutralization test (FRNT) (Case et al., 2020). As

134

expected, serum from ChAd-control-immunized mice did not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection after

135

primary immunization or boosting. In contrast, serum from ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S vaccinated

136

animals strongly neutralized SARS-CoV-2 infection, and boosting enhanced this inhibitory activity

137

(Fig 1E and S1B-C).

138

Vaccine-induced memory CD8+ T cell and antigen specific B cell responses.

139

Because optimal vaccine immunity often is comprised of both humoral and cellular responses

140

(Slifka and Amanna, 2014), we measured the levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T

141

cells after vaccination. Four-week old BALB/c mice were immunized with ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S

142

or ChAd-control and boosted three weeks later. To assess the vaccine-induced SARS-CoV-2-

143

specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses, splenocytes were harvested one week after boosting

144

and stimulated ex vivo with a pool of 253 overlapping 15-mer S peptides (Table S1).

145

Subsequently, quantification of intracellular IFNg and granzyme B expression was determined by

146

flow cytometry. After peptide re-stimulation ex vivo, splenic CD8+ T cells expressed IFNg and both

147

splenic CD4+ and CD8+ T cells expressed granzyme B in mice immunized with ChAd-SARS-CoV-

148

2-S but not the ChAd-control vector (Fig 1F-G and S2). To assess the antigen-specific B cell

149

responses, splenocytes were harvested and subjected to an ELISPOT analysis with S protein.

150

The ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S vaccine induced S protein-specific IgG antibody-secreting cells in the

151

spleen whereas the control vaccine did not (Fig 1H).

152

Intramuscular immunization with ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S vaccine protects against

153

SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lung. We tested the protective activity of the ChAd vaccine in a

154

recently developed SARS-CoV-2 infection model wherein BALB/c mice express hACE2 in the

155

lung after intranasal delivery of a vectored human Ad (Hu-Ad5-hACE2) (Hassan et al., 2020).

156

Endogenous mouse ACE2 does not support viral entry (Letko et al., 2020), and this system

157

enables productive SARS-CoV-2 infection in the mouse lung. Four-week-old BALB/c mice first

158

were immunized via an intramuscular route with ChAd-control or ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S vaccines.

159

Approximately thirty days later, mice were administered 108 plaque-forming units (PFU) of Hu-

160

Ad5-hACE2 and anti-Ifnar1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) via intranasal and intraperitoneal routes,

161

respectively. We also administered a single dose of anti-Ifnar1 mAb to enhance lung

162

pathogenesis in this model (Hassan et al., 2020). We confirmed the absence of cross-immunity

163

between the ChAd and the Hu-Ad5 vector. Serum from ChAd-immunized mice did not neutralize

164

Hu-Ad5 infection (Fig S3A-B).

165

Five days after Hu-Ad5-hACE2 transduction, mice were challenged via intranasal route

166

with 4 x 105 focus-forming units (FFU) of SARS-CoV-2 (Fig 2A). At 4 days post-infection (dpi),

167

the peak of viral burden in this model (Hassan et al., 2020), mice were euthanized, and lungs,

168

spleen, and heart were harvested for viral burden and cytokine analysis. Notably, there was no

169

detectable infectious virus in the lungs of mice immunized with ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S as

170

determined by plaque assay, whereas high levels were present in mice vaccinated with ChAd-

171

control (Fig 2B). Consistent with this result, we observed reduced viral RNA levels in the lung,

172

heart, and spleen of ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S vaccinated animals compared to mice receiving the

173

ChAd-control vector (Fig 2C). In situ hybridization staining for viral RNA in lungs harvested at 4

174

dpi revealed a substantial decrease of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in pneumocytes of animals immunized

175

with ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S compared to the ChAd-control (Fig 2D). A subset of immunized

176

animals was euthanized at 8 dpi, and tissues were harvested for evaluation. At this time point,

177

viral RNA levels again were lower or absent in the lung and spleen of ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S

178

immunized mice compared to the control ChAd vector (Fig 2C). Collectively, these data indicate

179

that a single intramuscular immunization with ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S results in markedly reduced,

180

but not abrogated, SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lungs of challenged mice.

181

We next assessed the effect of the vaccine on lung inflammation and disease. Several

182

proinflammatory cytokines and chemokine mRNA levels were lower in the lung tissues of animals

183

immunized with ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S compared to ChAd-control including CXCL10, IL1b, IL-6,

184

CCL5, IFNb, and IFNl (Fig 2E). Moreover, mice immunized with ChAd-control vaccine and

185

challenged with SARS-CoV-2 showed evidence of viral pneumonia characterized by immune cell

186

accumulation in perivascular and alveolar locations, vascular congestion, and interstitial edema.

187

In contrast, animals immunized with ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S showed a marked attenuation of the

188

inflammatory response in the lung that develops in the ChAd-control-immunized mice (Fig 3).

189

Thus, immunization with Ch-Ad-SARS-CoV-2 decreases both viral infection and the consequent

190

lung inflammation and injury associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

191

We then assessed for improved protection using a prime-boost vaccine regimen. BALB/c

192

mice were immunized via an intramuscular route with ChAd-control or ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S and

193

received a homologous booster dose four weeks later. At day 29 post-boost, mice were treated

194

with a single dose of anti-Ifnar1 antibody followed by Hu-Ad5-hACE2 and then challenged with

195

SARS-CoV-2 five days later. As expected, the prime-boost regimen protected against SARS-

196

CoV-2 challenge with no infectious virus detected in the lungs (Fig 2F). Although marked

197

reductions of viral RNA in the lung, spleen, and heart were detected at 4 dpi, residual levels of

198

viral RNA still were present suggesting protection was not complete, even after boosting (Fig 2G).

199

A single intranasal immunization with ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S induces sterilizing

200

immunity against SARS-CoV-2. Mucosal immunization through the nasopharyngeal route can

201

elicit local immune responses including secretory IgA antibodies that confer protection at or near

202

the site of inoculation of respiratory pathogens (Neutra and Kozlowski, 2006). To assess the

203

immunogenicity and protective efficacy of mucosal vaccination, five-week old BALB/c mice were

204

inoculated via intranasal route with 1010 viral particles of ChAd-control or ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S

205

(Fig 4A). Serum samples were collected at four weeks post-immunization to evaluate humoral

206

immune responses. Intranasal immunization of ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S but not ChAd-control

207

induced high levels of S- and RBD-specific IgG and IgA (Fig 4B-C) and SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing

208

antibodies (geometric mean titer of 1/1,574) in serum (Fig 4D and S4A). Serum antibodies from

209

mice immunized with ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S equivalently neutralized a recombinant, luciferase-

210

expressing variant of SARS-CoV-2 encoding a D614G mutation in the S protein (Fig S4B); this

211

finding is important, because many circulating viruses contain this substitution, which is

212

associated with greater infectivity in cell culture (https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.12.148726). We

213

also assessed the SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)

214

fluid of immunized mice. BAL fluid from ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S but not ChAd-control vaccinated

215

mice showed high levels of S- and RBD-specific IgG and IgA antibodies (Fig 4E-F) including

216

those with neutralizing activity (Fig 4G and S4C).

217

To assess T cell responses activated via mucosal immunization, mice were vaccinated

218

via intranasal route with either ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S or ChAd-control and boosted similarly four

219

weeks later. Lungs were harvested one-week post-boosting, and T cells were analyzed by flow

220

cytometry. Re-stimulation ex vivo with a pool of S peptides resulted in a marked increase in IFNg

221

and granzyme B producing CD8+ T cells in the lungs of mice that received the ChAd-SARS-CoV-

222

2-S

223

CD103+CD69+CD8+ T cells in the lung was identified (Fig 4I) which is phenotypically consistent

224

with vaccine-induced resident memory T cells (Takamura, 2017). In the spleen, we detected

225

antibody-secreting plasma cells producing IgA or IgG against the S protein after intranasal

226

immunization with ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S (Fig 4J). Of note, we observed an ~-5-fold higher

frequency of B cells secreting anti-S IgA than IgG.

We evaluated the protective efficacy of the ChAd vaccine after single-dose intranasal

immunization. At day 30 post-vaccination, mice were administered 108 PFU of Hu-Ad5-hACE2

230

and anti-Ifnar1 mAb as described above. Five days later, mice were challenged with 4 x 105 FFU

231

of SARS-CoV-2. At 4 and 8 dpi, lungs, spleen, heart, nasal turbinates, and nasal washes were

232

harvested and assessed for viral burden. Intranasal delivery of the ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S vaccine

233

demonstrated remarkable protective efficacy as judged by an absence of infectious virus in the

234

lungs (Fig 5A) and almost no measurable viral RNA in the lung, spleen, heart, nasal turbinates,

235

or nasal washes (Fig 5B). The very low viral RNA levels in the lung and nasal turbinates at 4 dpi

236

likely reflects the input, non-replicating virus, as similar levels were measured at this time point in

237

C57BL/6 mice lacking hACE2 receptor expression (Hassan et al., 2020). Cytokine and chemokine

238

mRNA levels in lung homogenates also were substantially lower in mice immunized with the

239

ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S than the ChAd-control vaccine (Fig 5C), with residual expression likely due

240

to the human Ad vector hACE2 delivery system. Finally, histopathological analysis of lung tissues

241

from animals vaccinated with ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S by intranasal route and challenged with

242

SARS-CoV-2 showed minimal, if any, perivascular and alveolar infiltrates at 8 dpi compared to

243

the extensive inflammation observed in ChAd-control vaccinated animals (Fig 5D).

244

To determine if sterilizing immunity was achieved with intranasal delivery of ChAd-SARS-

245

CoV-2-S, we measured anti-NP antibodies at 8 dpi and compared them to responses from 5 days

246

before SARS-CoV-2 infection. Because the NP gene is absent from the vaccine vector, induction

of humoral immune responses against NP after SARS-CoV-2 exposure (Ni et al., 2020) suggests

248

viral protein translation and active infection. After SARS-CoV-2 challenge, anti-NP antibody

249

responses were detected in ChAd-control mice vaccinated by an intranasal route or ChAd-control

250

and ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S mice vaccinated by an intramuscular route (Fig 5E and S1D).

251

Remarkably, none of the mice immunized with ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S via an intranasal route

252

showed significant increases in anti-NP antibody responses after SARS-CoV-2 infection.

253

Combined with our virological analyses, these data suggest that a single intranasal immunization

254

of ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S induces robust and likely sterilizing mucosal immunity, which prevents

255

SARS-CoV-2 infection in the upper and lower respiratory tracts of mice expressing the hACE2

256

receptor.

DISCUSSION

259

In this study, we evaluated intramuscular and intranasal administration of a replication-

260

incompetent ChAd vector as a vaccine platforms for SARS-CoV-2. Single dose immunization of

261

a stabilized S protein-based vaccine via an intramuscular route induced S- and RBD-specific

262

binding as well as neutralizing antibodies. Vaccination with one or two doses protected mice

263

expressing human ACE2 against SARS-CoV-2 challenge, as evidenced by an absence of

264

infectious virus in the lungs and substantially reduced viral RNA levels in lungs and other organs.

265

Mice immunized with ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S also showed markedly reduced if not absent lung

266

pathology, lung inflammation, and evidence of pneumonia compared to the control ChAd vaccine.

267

However, intramuscular vaccination of ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S did not confer sterilizing immunity,

268

as evidenced by detectable viral RNA levels in several tissues including the lung and induction of

269

anti-NP antibody responses. Mice immunized with a single dose of the ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S via

270

an intranasal route also were protected against SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Intranasal vaccination,

271

however, generated robust IgA and neutralizing antibody responses that protected against both

272

upper and lower respiratory tract SARS-CoV-2 infection and inhibited infection of both wild-type

273

and D614G variant viruses. The very low viral RNA in upper airway tissues and absence of

274

serological response to NP in the context of challenge strongly suggests that most animals

275

receiving a single intranasal dose of ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S achieve sterilizing immunity.

276

Although several vaccine candidates (e.g., lipid-encapsulated mRNA, DNA, inactivated,

277

and viral-vectored) rapidly advanced to human clinical trials in an expedited effort to control the

278

pandemic (Amanat and Krammer, 2020), few studies have demonstrated efficacy in pre-clinical

279

models. Rhesus macaques immunized with two or three doses of a DNA plasmid vaccine

280

encoding full-length SARS-CoV-2 S protein induced neutralizing antibody in sera and reduced

281

viral burden in BAL and nasal mucosa fluids (Yu et al., 2020). Moreover, three immunizations

282

over two weeks with purified, inactivated SARS-CoV-2 induced neutralizing antibodies, and

283

depending on the dose administered provided partial or complete protection against infection and

284

viral pneumonia in rhesus macaques (Gao et al., 2020). One limitation of these challenge models

285

is that rhesus macaques develop mild interstitial pneumonia after SARS-CoV-2 infection

286

compared to some humans and other non-human primate species (Chandrashekar et al., 2020;

287

Munster et al., 2020). Our study in hACE2-expressing mice show that a single intramuscular or

288

intranasal dose of ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S vaccine confers substantial and possibly complete

289

protection against viral replication, inflammation, and lung disease.

290

Our approach supports the use of non-human Ad-vectored vaccines against emerging

291

RNA viruses including SARS-CoV-2. Previously, we showed the efficacy of single-dose or two-

292

dose regimens of a gorilla Ad encoding the prM-E genes of Zika virus (ZIKV) in several mouse

293

challenge models including in the context of pregnancy (Hassan et al., 2019). Others have

294

evaluated ChAd or rhesus macaque Ad vaccine candidates against ZIKV and shown efficacy in

295

mice and non-human primates (Abbink et al., 2016; López-Camacho et al., 2018). A different

296

ChAd encoding the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 S protein (ChAdOx1) is currently in clinical trials in

297

humans (NCT04324606). Although data from the human trials has not yet been reported, studies

298

in rhesus macaques suggest that a single intramuscular dose protects against infection in the

299

lung

300

(https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.13.093195v1). None of the vaccines evaluated

301

against SARS-CoV-2 has shown evidence of immune enhancement in any pre-clinical or clinical

302

study, which has been a theoretical risk based on studies with other human and animal

303

coronaviruses (de Alwis et al., 2020; Diamond and Pierson, 2020). Indeed, and in contrast to data

304

with SARS-CoV vaccines or antibodies (Bolles et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2019; Weingartl et al., 2004),

305

we did not observe enhanced infection, immunopathology, or disease in animals immunized with

306

ChAd encoding SARS-CoV-2 S proteins or administered passively transferred monoclonal

307

antibodies (Alsoussi et al., 2020; Hassan et al., 2020).

310

peptide restimulation. The induction of robust CD8+ T cell responses by the ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-

311

S vaccine is consistent with reports with other simian Ad vectors (Douglas et al., 2010; Hodgson

312

et al., 2015; Reyes-Sandoval et al., 2010). ChAd vaccine vectors not only overcome issues of

313

pre-existing immunity against human adenoviruses but also have immunological advantages

314

because they do not induce exhausted T cell responses (Penaloza-MacMaster et al., 2013).

315

A single intranasal dose of ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S conferred superior immunity against

316

SARS-CoV-2 challenge, more so than one or two intramuscular immunizations of the same

317

vaccine and dose. Given that the serum neutralizing antibody responses was comparable, we

318

hypothesize the greater protection observed after intranasal delivery was because of the mucosal

319

immune responses generated. Indeed, high levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA were detected in

320

serum and lung, and B cells secreting IgA were detected in the spleen. Moreover, intranasal

321

vaccination also induced SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells in the lung including CD103+CD69+

322

cells, which are likely of a resident memory phenotype. To our knowledge, none of the SARS-

323

CoV-2 vaccine platforms currently in clinical trials use an intranasal delivery approach. There has

324

been great interest in using intranasal delivery for influenza A virus vaccines because of their

325

ability to elicit local humoral and cellular immune responses (Calzas and Chevalier, 2019). Indeed,

326

sterilizing immunity to influenza A virus re-infection requires local adaptive immune responses in

327

the lung, which is optimally induced by intranasal and not intramuscular inoculation (Dutta et al.,

328

2016; Laurie et al., 2010). While there are concerns with administering live-attenuated viral

329

vaccines via an intranasal route, subunit-based or replication-incompetent vectored vaccines are

330

promising for generating mucosal immunity in a safer manner, especially given advances in

331

formulation (Yusuf and Kett, 2017).

332

Although a single intranasal administration of ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S protected against

333

SARS-CoV-2 replication in lungs, we note some limitations in our study. We performed challenge

334

studies in mice transduced with hACE2 using a human Ad5 vector, which could be complicated

335

by vector immunity. Notwithstanding this possibility, we confirmed an absence of heterologous

14

336

neutralizing serum antibody induced by one or two doses of ChAd vector against the Hu-Ad5 and

337

more importantly, detected high levels of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the ChAd-control vaccinated

338

mice after challenge. Future immunization and challenge studies with hACE2 transgenic mice

339

(Bao et al., 2020; Jiang et al., 2020) and non-human primates can overcome this potential issue

340

and expand upon our understanding of how route of inoculation impacts vaccine-mediated

341

protection. Moreover, studies in humans are needed to assess for cross-immunity between the

342

ChAd vector (simian Ad-36) and adenoviruses circulating in humans. Although we expect this will

343

be much less than that observed with Hu-Ad5 vaccine vectors (Zhu et al., 2020), low levels of

344

pre-existing immunity against simian adenoviruses could affect vaccine efficacy in selected

345

populations with non-human primate exposures (e.g., zoo workers, veterinarians, and laboratory

346

workers at primate centers). Finally, studies must be conducted to monitor immune responses

347

over time after intranasal vaccination with ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S to establish the durability of the

348

protective response.

349

In summary, our studies establish that immunization with ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S induces

350

both neutralizing antibody and antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses. While a single

351

intramuscular immunization of ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S confers protection against SARS-CoV-2

352

infection and inflammation in the lungs, intranasal delivery of ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S induces

353

mucosal immunity, provides superior protection, and likely promotes sterilizing immunity, at least

354

in mice transiently expressing the hACE2 receptor. We suggest that intranasal delivery of ChAd-

355

SARS-CoV-2-S is a promising platform for controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection, disease, and

356

transmission, and thus warrants clinical evaluation in humans.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS

533

Viruses and cells. Vero E6 (CRL-1586, American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Vero

534

CCL81 (ATCC), and HEK293 cells were cultured at 37°C in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle medium

535

(DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 10 mM HEPES pH 7.3, 1 mM sodium

536

pyruvate, 1X non-essential amino acids, and 100 U/ml of penicillin–streptomycin.

537

SARS-CoV-2 strain 2019 n-CoV/USA_WA1/2020 was obtained from the Centers for

538

Disease Control and Prevention (a gift from Natalie Thornburg). The virus was passaged once in

539

Vero CCL81 cells and titrated by focus-forming assay (FFA) on Vero E6 cells. The recombinant

540

luciferase-expressing full-length SARS-CoV-2 reporter virus (2019 n-CoV/USA_WA1/2020 strain)

541

has been reported previously (Zost et al., 2020), and the D614G variant will be described

542

elsewhere (R. Baric, manuscript in preparation). All work with infectious SARS-CoV-2 was

543

performed in Institutional Biosafety Committee approved BSL3 and A-BSL3 facilities using

544

appropriate positive pressure air respirators and protective equipment.

545

Mouse experiments. Animal studies were carried out in accordance with the

546

recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National

547

Institutes of Health. The protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use

548

Committee at the Washington University School of Medicine (Assurance number A3381-01).

549

Virus inoculations were performed under anesthesia that was induced and maintained with

550

ketamine hydrochloride and xylazine, and all efforts were made to minimize animal suffering.

551

Female BALB/c mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (catalog 000651).

552

Four to five-week-old animals were immunized with 1010 viral particles (vp) of ChAdV-empty or

553

ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S in 50 µl PBS via intramuscular injection in the hind leg or via intranasal

554

inoculation. Subsets of immunized animals were boosted four weeks after primary immunization

555

using the same route used for primary immunization. Vaccinated mice (10 to 11-week-old) were

556

given a single intraperitoneal injection of 2 mg of anti-Ifnar1 mAb (MAR1-5A3 (Sheehan et al.,

557

2006), Leinco) one day before intranasal administration of 108 PFU of Hu-AdV5-hACE2. Five days

558

after Hu-AdV5 transduction, mice were inoculated with 4 x 105 FFU of SARS-CoV-2 by the

559

intranasal route. Animals were euthanized at 4 or 8 dpi, and tissues were harvested for virological,

560

immunological, and pathological analyses.

METHOD DETAILS

563

Construction of chimpanzee adenovirus vectors. Simian Ad36 vector (ChAd) (Roy et

564

al., 2011) was obtained from the Penn Vector Core of the University of Pennsylvania. The ChAd

565

genome was engineered with deletions in the E1 and E3B region (GenBank: FJ025917.1;

566

nucleotides 455-3026 and 30072-31869, respectively). A modified human cytomegalovirus major

567

immediate early promoter sequence was incorporated in place of the E1 gene in counterclockwise

568

orientation on the complementary DNA strand. CMV modification included an addition of

569

two copies of the tet operator 2 (TetO2) sequence (Hillen and Berens, 1994) inserted in tandem

570

(5´-TCT CTA TCA CTG ATA GGG AGA TCT CTA TCA CTG ATA GG GA-3´) between the TATA

571

box and the mRNA start (GenBank: MN920393, nucleotides 174211-174212). SARS-CoV-2 S

572

(encoding a prefusion stabilized mutant with two proline substitutions at residues K986 and V987

573

that stabilize the prefusion form of S (Pallesen et al., 2017; Wrapp et al., 2020a)) was cloned into

574

a unique PmeI site under the CMV-tetO2 promoter control in pSAd36 genomic plasmid to

575

generate pSAd36-S. In parallel, a pSAd36-control carrying an empty CMV-tetO2 cassette with no

576

transgene also was generated. The pSAd36-S and pSAd-control plasmids were linearized

577

with PacI restriction enzyme to liberate viral genomes for transfection into T-Rex 293-HEK cells

578

(Invitrogen). The rescued replication-incompetent ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S and ChAd-Control

579

vectors were scaled up in 293 cells and purified by CsCl density-gradient ultracentrifugation. Viral

580

particle concentration in each vector preparation was determined by spectrophotometry at 260

581

nm as described (Maizel et al., 1968).

582

Construction of a human adenovirus vector expressing human ACE2. Codon-

583

optimized hACE2 sequences were cloned into the shuttle vector (pShuttle-CMV, Addgene

584

240007) to generate pShuttle-hACE2. pShuttle-hACE2 was linearized with PmeI and

585

subsequently cotransformed with the HuAdv5 backbone plasmid (pAdEasy-1 vector; Addgene

586

240005) into E. coli strain BJ5183 to generate pAdV5-ACE2 by homologous recombination as

587

described (He et al., 1998). The pAdEasy-1 plasmid containing the HuAdV5 genome has

588

deletions in E1 and E3 genes. hACE2 is under transcriptional control of a cytomegalovirus

589

promotor and is flanked at its 3’ end by a SV40 polyadenylation signal. The pAd-hACE2 was

590

linearized with PacI restriction enzyme before transfection into T-Rex 293 HEK cells (Invitrogen)

591

to generate HuAdv5-hACE2. Recombinant HuAdv5-hACE2 was produced in 293-HEK cells and

592

purified by CsCl density-gradient ultracentrifugation. The viral titer was determined by plaque

593

assay in 293-HEK cells.

594

In situ RNA hybridization and histology. RNA in situ hybridization was performed using

595

RNAscope 2.5 HD (Brown) (Advanced Cell Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer’s

596

instructions. Left lung tissues were collected at necropsy, inflated with 10% neutral buffered

598

Paraffin-embedded lung sections were deparaffinized by incubating at 60°C for 1 h, and

599

endogenous peroxidases were quenched with H2O2 for 10 min at room temperature. Slides were

600

hybridization and signal amplification. Sections were counterstained with Gill’s hematoxylin and

603

visualized by brightfield microscopy. Some lung sections were processed for histology after

604

hematoxylin and eosin staining.

605

SARS-CoV-2 Neutralization assays. Heat-inactivated serum samples were diluted

606

serially and incubated with 102 FFU of SARS-CoV-2 for 1 h at 37°C. The virus-serum mixtures

607

were added to Vero cell monolayers in 96-well plates and incubated for 1 h at 37°C.

608

Subsequently, cells were overlaid with 1% (w/v) methylcellulose in MEM supplemented with 2%

609

FBS. Plates were incubated for 30 h before fixation using 4% PFA in PBS for 1 h at room

610

temperature. Cells were washed then sequentially incubated with anti-SARS-CoV-2 CR3022

611

antibody (Yuan et al., 2020) (1 µg/mL) and a HRP-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (Sigma) in

612

PBS supplemented with 0.1% (w/v) saponin (Sigma) and 0.1% BSA. TrueBlue peroxidase

613

substrate (KPL) was used to develop the plates before counting the foci on a BioSpot analyzer

614

(Cellular Technology Limited). For neutralization experiments with luciferase expressing SARS-

615

CoV-2, serum samples were diluted 3-fold starting at 1:50 and mixed with 85 PFU of each

616

recombinant virus (wild-type and D614G). Vero E6 cells plated in clear-bottom black-walled 96-

617

well plates (Corning) were inoculated with serum-virus mixtures, and cells were cultured at 37oC

618

for 48 h. Subsequently, cells were lysed and luciferase activity was measured using the Nano-

619

Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s specifications.

620

Hu-AdV5 neutralization assays. One day prior to Hu-AdV5-hACE2 transduction, serum

621

samples were collected from mice immunized intramuscularly with ChAd-Control or ChAd-SARS-

622

CoV-2-S. Sera were heat-inactivated and serially diluted prior to incubation with 102 FFU of Hu-

623

AdV5 for 1 h at 37°C. The virus-serum mixtures were added to HEK293 cell monolayers in 96-

624

well plates and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. Cells were then overlaid with 1% (w/v) methylcellulose

625

in MEM supplemented with 5% FBS. Plates were incubated at 37°C for 48 h before fixation with

626

2% PFA in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Subsequently, plates were washed with PBS and

627

incubated overnight at 4°C with biotinylated anti-HuAdV5-hexon antibody (2 µg/mL; Novus

628

Biologicals NB600413) diluted in permeabilization buffer (PBS supplemented with 0.1% (w/v)

629

saponin and 0.1% BSA). Plates were washed again and incubated with streptavidin-HRP (1:3000;

630

Vector Laboratories SA-5004) in permeabilization buffer for 30 min at room temperature. After a

631

final wash series, plates were developed using TrueBlue peroxidase substrate (KPL) and foci

632

were counted on a BioSpot analyzer (Cellular Technology Limited).

633

Protein expression and purification. Purified RNA from the 2019-nCoV/USA-WA1/2020

634

SARS-CoV-2 strain was reverse transcribed into cDNA and used as the template for recombinant

635

gene cloning. A full-length SARS-CoV-2 NP (NP-FL) was cloned into pET21a with a hexahistidine

636

tag

637

(bioWORLD). Following overnight induction with isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (Goldbio)

638

at 25°C, cells were lysed in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5, 1 M NaCl, 5 mM β-mercaptopethanol, and 5

639

mM imidazole for nickel-affinity purification. Following elution in the prior buffer supplemented with

640

500 mM imidazole, the protein was purified to homogeneity using size exclusion and, in some

641

cases, cation exchange chromatography. SARS-CoV-2 RBD and S ectodomain (S1/S2 furin

642

cleavage site was disrupted, double proline mutations were introduced into the S2 subunit, and

643

foldon trimerization motif was incorporated) were cloned into pFM1.2 with a C-terminal

644

hexahistidine or octahistidine tag, transiently transfected into Expi293F cells, and purified by

buffer, PBSTBA) either for 1 h at 37°C or overnight at 4°C. Heat-inactivated serum samples were

651

diluted in PBSTBA in a separate 96-well polypropylene plate. The plates then were washed thrice

652

with 1X PBS + 0.05% Tween-20 (PBST), followed by addition of 50 µL of respective serum

653

dilutions. Sera were incubated in the blocked ELISA plates for at least 1 h at room temperature.

654

The ELISA plates were again washed thrice in PBST, followed by addition of 50 µL of 1:2000 anti-

655

mouse IgG-HRP (Southern Biotech Cat. #1030-05) in PBST or 1:10000 of biotinylated anti-mouse

656

IgG, anti-mouse IgM, or anti-mouse IgA in PBSTBA (SouthernBiotech). Plates were incubated at

657

room temperature for 1 h, washed thrice in PBST, and then 1:5000 dilution of streptavidin-HRP

658

(ThermoFisher) was added to wells. Following a 1 h incubation at room temperature, plates were

659

washed thrice with PBST and 50 µL of 1-Step Ultra TMB-ELISA was added (ThermoFisher Cat.

660

#34028). Following a 12 to 15-min incubation, reactions were stopped with 50 µL of 2 M sulfuric
