Abstract
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes Coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19), a respiratory tract infection. The standard molecular diagnostic
test is a multistep process involving viral RNA extraction and real-time quantitative reverse
transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR). Laboratories across the globe face constraints on equipment
and reagents during the COVID-19 pandemic. We have developed a simplified qRT-PCR
assay that removes the need for an RNA extraction process and can be run on a real-time
thermal cycler. The assay uses custom primers and probes, and maintains diagnostic
sensitivity within 98.0% compared to the assay run on a high-throughput, random-access
automated platform, the Panther Fusion (Hologic). This assay can be used to increase
capacity for COVID-19 testing for national programmes worldwide.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory tract infection caused by a newly
emergent coronavirus – Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) –
which was first recognised in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019. Genetic
sequencing of the virus suggests that SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus closely linked to
SARS coronavirus 1 (Wu et al.2020).

The standard molecular diagnostic test for this virus is a multistep process involving viral
RNA extraction and real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR). Although
many companies have produced PCR kits to amplify the viral RNA, RNA extraction at any
scale in a diagnostic laboratory is performed on a limited number of automated platforms
that require specific reagents and consumables. This has led to significant effort to build
large laboratories with existing research equipment to increase testing capacity, and to
extract RNA on more open platforms that enable non-specific reagents and plastics to be
used.

The COVID-19 pandemic placed severe constraints on the availability of laboratory
equipment, reagents and consumables required for molecular diagnostics in the UK and
Europe. This delayed the ability to scale-up testing capacity required for healthcare and
population screening.

At Health Services Laboratories (HSL), we developed a qRT-PCR that can be run on a highthroughput, random-access automated platform, the Panther Fusion (Hologic). Using the
Open Access facility on this platform, custom primers and probes designed in-house can be
added to a DNA/RNA extraction cartridge. In London, this qRT-PCR was used for largescale testing of patients hospitalized with suspected COVID-19. However, the COVID-19
pandemic also led to these cartridges being in short supply.

Using the same primers and probes, we have now developed a qRT-PCR that can be run on
a real-time thermal cycler without the need for an RNA extraction process. This qRT-PCR
maintains sensitivity to within 98.0% of the assay run on the Panther Fusion.

Method
A panel of SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative samples was used to compare the RNA
extraction and RNA-extraction free methods.

RNA extraction
100 μL viral transport medium (VTM) from a swab was added to 100 μL Qiagen Lysis buffer
containing guanidinum to inactivate the virus. This was then processed either on a
QIAsymphony SP using the QIAsymphony DSP Virus/pathogen Mini kit and Complex 200
protocol, or the EZ1 Advanced XL using the EZ1 DSP virus kit. The elution volume was set
to 60 μL, and 10 μL of the purified RNA was added to the PCR.

Direct sample transfer:
10 μL, 5 μL and 2 μL of sample expressed in viral transport medium was added directly to
the PCR without any heating step, the plate was sealed and thermal cycling begun.

Sample heating prior to direct transfer
50 μL of sample expressed in viral transport medium was added to a PCR tube and heated
to 95 °C for 10 mins prior to loading into the PCR at 10ul, 5 μL and 2 μL.

RT-PCR
A 20 μL reaction containing 10 μL RNA, 5 μL 4x TaqMan Fast Virus 1-step Master Mix
(Applied Biosystems) and 5 μL primer and probe mix as shown in Table 1. Where VTM was

added directly to the PCR at 5 μL or 2 μL, this was made up to 10 μL with RNase-Free
water.
Cycling was performed at 56 °C for 15 min for reverse transcription, followed by 95 °C for 20
sec and then 45 cycles of 95 °C for 3 s, 60 °C for 30s using an Applied Biosystems
QuantStudio 5 real-time PCR system (ThermoFisher Scientific).

The primer/probe mix was made up in bulk and contained 5pmol primer/probe per reaction.
(For example, a mix for 100 reactions would have 5 μL of each N gene primer/probe and 2.5
μL each RNaseP primer/probe at 100 μM stock concentration, made up to 5 μL per reaction
with water).

Panther Fusion Open Access Assay
Panther Fusion PPR was made with the SARS-CoV-2 N gene primers and probe (Table 1)
and Hologic internal RNA IC control primers and probe. A PPR tube for 40 reactions was
made by adding 3 μL each N gene primer or probe (at 100 μM stock) and 8 μL of the RNA
IC primer and probe (Supplied by Hologic). The salts were KCl at 100 mM (37.5 μL of 2M
stock), MgCl2 at 3mM (4.5 μL of 1M stock) and Tris (pH 8.0) at 8mM (12 μL of 1M stock).
This primer probe salt mix was made up to 1200 μL with water and overlaid with 400 μL
mineral oil (Hologic) in a 2ml PPR tube (Hologic). This assay was run on the Panther Fusion
(Hologic) with and Open Access RNA/DNA enzyme cartridge.

Results
The RNA extraction method was compared to the direct addition of samples to the RT-PCR
with and without prior heating.
When 10 μL of the heated or unheated sample was added to the PCR, no amplification was
observed. Both the direct addition methods gave lower median Ct values than those added
after heat treatment and were equivalent to the EZ1 (Qiagen) extraction (Figure1).

Figure 1: Median and interquartile range for Ct values obtained using different methods

The lowest Ct values were achieved by adding 2 μL of the VTM direct to the PCR without
any prior heating (median Ct value 25.74 vs 29.51 using EZ1 RNA). This method was
selected for further analysis.
The direct addition of 2 μL sample to the PCR was compared to the standard method in use
within the clinical laboratory using the Open access channel of the Panther Fusion. An
overall accuracy of 98.8% was achieved compared to the Panther Fusion assay (see Table
2).

The analytical sensitivity was compared by diluting a positive clinical sample to end point,
and testing using the extracted RNA and adding VTM directly to the PCR. The results are
shown in Table 3.

There was no cross reactivity with conventional coronavirus types OC43, NL63, 229E,
HKU1, and a number of other respiratory viruses such as influenza A and B, respiratory
syncytial virus, parainfluenza, metapneumovirus, adenovirus, rhinovirus and enterovirus.

Conclusion
Direct addition of samples to the qRT-PCR without extraction with a diagnostic sensitivity of
98.0%, specificity of 100% and accuracy of 98.8% compared to the method on the Panther
Fusion. This simplifies the process for COVID-19 testing, and will enable increased capacity
in diagnostic laboratories.

Discussion
Implementation of this method will enable laboratories to provide a COVID-19 testing service
without the need for RNA extraction equipment, reagents and consumables. Turn-around
times are similar to those of high-throughput RNA-based assays, and faster than a two-step
RNA extraction and qRT-PCR. Capacity can be significantly increased without the
extraction step but is dependent on the number of safety cabinets for swab processing and
number of real time PCR thermal cyclers.
Heating at 56°C for 15 minutes causes SARS CoV (SARS coronavirus) to lose Infectivity
(WHO, 2003). Health and safety assessments have been completed and the process has
been deemed safe to perform with relevant precautions and safety practices. Samples can
be processed in batches of 96, each batch takes 56 minutes to run the rtPCR on the thermal
cycler, the rate limiting step being the swab processing. Lower numbers would be processed
more rapidly, within an equivalent time to a point-of-care test. Standard swab processing can
be automated to speed up the initial process on a large scale.

Many laboratories use real-time thermal cyclers, so this method can be used to increase
national screening capacity without the need for other specialized equipment or RNA
extraction reagents.

Applying an extraction-free PCR protocol as described here would avoid limitations on
COVID-19 screening capacity in the UK and elsewhere caused by global PCR reagent
supply constraints. We recommend this method is explored further by other medical
laboratories using alternative PCR reagents to improve the resilience and capacity of
virology laboratories during the pandemic. The sensitivity of the assay will be dependent
upon the PCR efficiency, and so other PCR protocols will need to be carefully evaluated with
this new approach.
