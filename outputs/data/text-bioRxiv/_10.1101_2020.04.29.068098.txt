Abstract

35

The pneumonia-causing COVID-19 pandemia has prompt worldwide efforts to

36

understand its biological and clinical traits of newly identified HCoV-19 virus. In this

37

study, post-translational modification (PTM) of recombinant HCoV-19 S and hACE2

38

were characterized by LC-MSMS. We revealed that both proteins were highly

39

decorated with specific proportions of N-glycan subtypes. Out of 21 possible

40

glycosites in HCoV-19 S protein, 20 were confirmed completely occupied by

41

N-glycans, with oligomannose glycans being the most abundant type. All 7 possible

42

glycosylation sites in hACE2 were completely occupied mainly by complex type

43

N-glycans. However, we showed that glycosylation did not directly contribute to the

44

binding affinity between SARS-CoV spike protein and hACE2. Additionally, we also

45

identified multiple sites methylated in both proteins, and multiple prolines in hACE2

46

were converted to hydroxylproline. Refined structural models were built by adding

47

N-glycan and PTMs to recently published cryo-EM structure of the HCoV-19 S and

48

hACE2 generated with glycosylation sites in the vicinity of binding surface. The PTM

49

and glycan maps of both HCoV-19 S and hACE2 provide additional structural details

50

to study mechanisms underlying host attachment, immune response mediated by S

51

protein and hACE2, as well as knowledge to develop remedies and vaccines

52

desperately needed nowadays.

Introduction

57

The on-going coronavirus pandemia since December 2019 (COVID-19) has now

58

become a global health emergence (Dong et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020b; Zhou et al.,

59

2020b). The disease is caused by a newly identified beta-coronavirus HCoV-19 (also

60

known as SARS-CoV-2) which is closely related to severe acute respiratory syndrome

61

coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Like the SARS, the HCoV-19 causes lower respiratory

62

tract infection (LRTI) which may eventually develop to atypical pneumonia that

63

requires intensive care and mechanical ventilation (Guan et al., 2020; Wang et al.,

64

2020; Zhou et al., 2020a). Compared to SARS-CoV, the HCoV-19 is more contagious

65

and is infecting more population worldwide thus causing substantially more casualties

66

(Guan et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020a). Although possible viral reservoirs including

67

bats and pangolin have been suggested for HCoV-19 (Zhang et al., 2020; Zhou et al.,

68

2020b), more investigations are need to ascertain its source and routes of zoonotic

69

transmission (Wu et al., 2020a; Xu, 2020; Zhang and Holmes, 2020). To date, no

70

approved vaccine or remedy specific for coronaviruses infection, including that of

71

HCoV-19, is available.

72

Akin to the SARS-CoV, the virion surface spike glycoprotein encoded by

73

HCoV-19 S gene is essential for target cell attachment and fusion processes

74

(Hoffmann et al., 2020; Walls et al., 2020a; Wan et al., 2020). Given the importance

75

of S protein in COVID-19 pathogenesis and its potential immunogenicity for vaccine

76

development, global efforts have been made to elucidate the structure of S protein

77

shortly after the publishing of the first HCoV-19 sequence (Walls et al., 2020a;

78

Wrapp et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020b). The HCoV-19 S glycoprotein is a 1273-amino

79

acid precursor polypeptide and can be cleaved by host cell proteases (cathepsin L,

80

TMPRSS2) into S1 fragment that contains the receptor binding domain (RBD) to

81

attach host receptor human Angiotensin I Converting Enzyme 2 (hACE2), and the S2

82

fragment responsible for the subsequent membrane fusion (Hoffmann et al., 2020;

83

Walls et al., 2020a; Wu et al., 2020b). The S protein is predicted to have a cleavable

84

N-terminal signal sequence (1-15), which presumably directs the protein toward the

85

endoplasmic reticulum (ER) for extensive glycan decoration before virion packing.

86

Glycosylation is one of the most prominent post-translational modifications

87

(PTM) in many viral spike or envelop proteins, and has been shown to mediate host

88

attachment, immune response as well as virion packaging and budding (Chang and

89

Zaia, 2019; de Groot, 2006; Fukushi et al., 2012; Li et al., 2017; Parsons et al., 2019;

90

Raman et al., 2016; Shih et al., 2006; York et al., 2019; Zheng et al., 2018; Zhou et al.,

91

2010). In particular, the binding of coronavirus S proteins to their respective receptors

92

has been shown to be mediated by its oligomannose N-glycan (Li et al., 2017; Parsons

93

et al., 2019; Zheng et al., 2018). Additionally, C-type lectin DC-SIGN and L-SIGN

94

can enhance viral entry via their binding to the S protein glycans (Han et al., 2007;

95

Jeffers et al., 2004). Therefore, numerous antiviral strategies have been designed to

96

interfere protein glycosylation or glycan-based interaction (Shih et al., 2006; Vincent

97

et al., 2005; Zheng et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2010), and glycosylation is considered as

98

a key aspect to develop effective vaccine (Chen et al., 2014; Kumar et al., 2020).

99

Like the SARS-CoV spike protein which contains 23 N-linked glycosylation

100

sequons (N-X-S/T, X≠P), HCoV-19 spike protein is predicted to host 22 per protomer

101

or 66 per trimer (Walls et al., 2020a). However, the potential glycosites pattern in S1

102

of HCoV-19 S protein is different to that of SARS-CoV, while the glycosylation sites

103

in S2 region are significant conserved between HCoV-19 and SARS-CoV. The

104

difference of S1 glycosylation pattern may link to biological and clinical

105

characteristics of HCoV-19 which is profoundly different to other coronavirus. In this

106

study, we report a comprehensive N-glycosylation profile, as well as other PTMs, of

107

HCoV-19 S protein and hACE2 elucidated by high resolution mass spectrometry

108

analyses, based on which reinterpretation of current HCoV-19 S protein structural

109

model was made to highlight important glycan features related to COVID-19

110

pathogenesis. Nonetheless, we demonstrate that the binding of HCoV-19 S protein

111

and hACE2 is independent on their glycosylation status.

Expression and purification of HCoV-19 spike ectodomain and hACE2

114

HCoV-19 S gene (virus isolate: Wuhan Hu-1; GenBank number QHD43416.1)

115

was synthesized (Genscript) with codons optimized for insect cell expression. Its

116

ectodomain (Val16-Pro1213) was cloned into pFastBac vector (Life Technologies

117

Inc.) with a N-terminal honeybee melittin signal peptide and C-terminal His6 and

118

Flag tags. HCoV-19 S protein was expressed in Sf9 insect cells using the Bac-to-Bac

119

system (Life Technologies Inc.) and harvested from cell culture medium followed by

120

purification procedure using Ni-NTA column and Superdex 200 gel filtration column

121

(GE Healthcare) in tandem. The extracellular domain of hACE2 (Gln18-Ser740,

122

NP_068576.1) with C-terminal Fc tag was expressed in HEK 293 cells were purified

123

by protein A sepharose beads (GE Healthcare).

124
125

SDS-PAGE analysis

126

To test their glycosylation status of HCoV-19 spike and hACE2 protein, both

127

proteins were deglycosylated by PNGase F (NEB, 1:50) overnight at 37°C in PBS.

128

Both the glycosylated and deglycosylated forms of HCoV-19 spike and hACE2

129

protein were then analyzed by 15% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)

130

followed by Coomassie blue staining.

131

Glycopeptide sample preparation

132

Proteins were first digested into tryptic peptides according to (Sun et al., 2016).

133

Briefly, hACE2 and S protein were first deduced by 10 mM dithiothreitol in 50 mM

134

ammonium bicarbonate (ABC) for 45 min at room temperature and then alkylated by

135

iodoacetamide for 45 mins at room temperature in the dark. Proteins were then

136

cleaned up by acetone precipitation and resuspended in 50 mM ABC. The alkylated

137

glycoproteins were then digested for 14 h at 37°C using sequencing-grade trypsin,

138

chymotrypsin or endoproteinase Lys-C, all purchased from Promega, with a

139

protein:protease ratio of 1:50 in 50 mM ABC. The peptides were desalted using HLB

140

columns (Waters).

141

The peptide samples were separated into duplicates. The first duplicate was

142

deglycosylated by PNGase F (NEB, 1:100) overnight at 37 ° C in 50 mM ABC

143

prepared in pure H2O18. The second duplicate was used to enrich intact

144

N-glycopeptides by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC). Briefly,

145

the GlycoWorks (Waters) cartridges were pre-conditioned with loading buffer

146

comprised of 15 mM ammonium acetate (AmA) and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)

147

in 80% Acetonitrile (ACN). Peptides in loading buffer were applied to the cartridges

148

and unbound flow-through (FT) fraction was collected. The column was washed two

149

times with loading buffer. Glycopeptides were eluted in 0.1% TFA. All peptide

150

fractions were desalted by house-made C18 stagetips before LC-MSMS analyses.

151
152

LC-MSMS experiment

153

About 500 ng of peptides were analysis using an Ultimate 3000 nanoflow liquid

154

chromatography system (Thermo Scientific, USA) connected to a hybrid Q-Exactive

155

HFX mass spectrometry (Thermo Scientific, USA). The mass spectrometer was

156

operated in data-dependent mode with a full scan MS spectra followed by MS2 scans

157

recording the top 20 most intense precursors sequentially isolated for fragmentation

158

using high energy collision dissociation (HCD). The MS and MS/MS spectra were

159

recorded using the Xcalibur software 2.3 (Thermo Scientific, USA). Detail parameters

160

for LC separation and mass spectrometry acquisition can be found in Supplementary

161

Table 1 and 2, respectively.

Evaluation of binding of HCoV-19 S protein and hACE2 by bio-layer

202

interferometry (BLI)

203

Binding of HCoV-19 S protein and hACE2 was measured on an Octet

204

Re96E (ForteBio) interferometry system. Briefly, HCoV-19 S protein were

205

immobilized using aminopropylsilan biosensors (18-5045, ForteBio). To evaluate the

206

influence of glycosylation of HCoV-19 S on binding, S protein were first incubated

207

with either 1000U/mL PNGase F (NEB) or deactivated PNGase F at 37 °C for 14 h.

208

After washing by kinetic buffer (1x PBS, pH 7.4, 0.01% BSA, and 0.002% Tween 20),

209

the association between HCoV-19 S and hACE2 was measured for 180 seconds at

210

30°C by exposing sensors to hACE2 in kinetic buffer at concentration of 12.5, 25, 50,

211

100, 200 nM, respectively. After binding phase, the sensors were exposed to 1x

212

kinetic buffer for dissociation for 300 seconds at 30°C. Signal baseline was subtracted

213

before data fitting using the equimolar binding model. Mean kon, koff values were

214

determined with a global fit model using all data. A parallel experiment was also

215

performed using hACE2 loaded sensor incubated with HCoV-19 S protein solution.

216

Analogously, immobilized hACE2 was pretreated by either PNGase F or deactivated

217

PNGase F to evaluate the influence of hACE2 glycosylation on binding. In all

218

experiment, PNGase F was deactivated by heating at 75 °C for 10 min.

Results

221

Determination of N-linked glycosylation sites on HCoV-19 S protein and hACE2

222

As shown in (Figure 1A), PNGase F deglycosylation resulted in deceasing

223

molecular weight of both HCoV-19 S protein and hACE2 on SDS-PAGE. Digestion

224

by PNGase F releases N-linked glycans from Asn within the N-X-S/T motif, which

225

also resulted in Asn deamidation by losing one hydrogen and one nitrogen while

226

incorporating one oxygen derived from the solvent (Bailey et al., 2012). To perform a

227

thorough survey of glycosylated sites, protease digested peptides from both proteins

228

were subjected to PNGase F deglycosylation in H2O18 that enables incorporation of

229

O18 and leads to a +2.98 Da mass increment, which was used to mark glycosylated

230

sites.

231

Analysis of the deglycosylated peptides from S protein by LC-MS/MS confirmed

232

20 N-linked glycosylation sites, including N61, N74, N122, N165, N234, N282, N331,

233

N343, N603, N616, N657, N709, N717, N801, N1074, N1098, N1134, N1158,

234

N1173 and N1194 (Table 1). Two remaining N-X-S/T sites, the N17 and N149 were

235

not identified in any deglycosylated peptide. However, peptide with glycosylated

236

N149 was identified directly without PNGase F treatment as described later, therefore

237

leading to a total of 21 glycosylation sites out of 22 potential sites with N-X-S/T

238

sequons in HCoV-19 S protein (Figure 1B). In addition, quantitative analysis of site

239

occupancy showed there were 18 sites completely glycosylated, while N603, N657

240

reached 43% and 74% occupancy (Table 1). Example mass spectra showing evidence

241

of N331 and N343 glycosylation was shown in (Figure 1C).

242

All 7 possible glycosylation sites in hACE2, N53, N90, N103, N322, N432, N546

243

and N690 were confirmed as glycosylated in our experiments (Table 1). As example,

244

mass spectra of N90 glycosylation were shown in Fig 1D. Quantitative analysis of site

245

occupancy showed all 7 sites were completely glycosylated (Table 1). All these data

246

suggested that both HCoV-19 S protein and hACE2 are highly decorated by

247

N-glycans.

250

To unveil possible post-translational modification (PTM) other than glycosylation,

251

LC-MSMS data of deglycosylated peptides from both HCoV-19 S protein and hACE2

252

were subjected to several rounds of spectra-database matching for common PTMs.

253

The major PTM found in both proteins was methylation on lysine, arginine or

254

glutamic acid, as summarized in Table 1. Using occupancy >50% as criteria to

255

identify site dominantly decorated with PTMs, we found 78R, 224E, 654E and 661E

256

in HCoV-19 S protein, 57E, 68K and 329E in hACE2 is highly methylated. In

257

addition, proline at site 253, 263, 321 and 346 in hACE2 can be found prominently

258

oxidized and converted to hydroxyproline. However, common PTMs such as

259

phosphorylation, acetylation or other acylations were not found in HCoV-19 S protein

260

and hACE2.

261
262

Global N-glycosylation profile of HCoV-19 S protein and hACE2

263

To resolve glycan camouflage on surface of HCoV-19 S protein and hACE2,

264

intact glycopeptides derived from protease digestion and fractionated by HILIC SPE

265

were directly subject to LC-MSMS analysis specifically designed to detect peptides

266

with extra molecular weight due to N-glycan attachment. Due to the highly

267

heterogeneous nature of glycan chain, in our study a unique glycopeptides was

268

designated as combination of both unique peptide sequence with a specific N-glycan

269

composition. According to this criteria, 419 and 467 unique N-glycopeptides were

270

identified from HCoV-19 S proteins and hACE2, respectively (Table 2 and 3). Out of

271

20 HCoV-19 S glycosylated sides identified by PNGase F experiment, 19 were

272

confirmed by intact glycopeptide profiling. Despite all 7 glycosylation sites in hACE2

273

were identified previously in deglycosylated peptides labeled with deamidation,

274

N-glycan profile was obtained in 5 sites: N90, N103, N432, N546 and N690. Example

275

N-glycopeptides spectra from HCoV-19 S and hACE2 could be found in

276

Supplementary Figure 1.

277

A total of 144 N-glycans were found in HCoV-19 S protein, with majority of

278

them containing the common N-acetylglucosamine core (Table 2). All N-glycosites in

279

S protein were attached with multiple types of N-glycans, with N343 decorated by the

most diverse N-glycans. The HCoV-19 S N-glycan composition preferentially

281

comprising pauci- or high-mannose type oligosaccharides, except in four N-glycosites

282

(N73, N343, N717 and N1173) containing a high proportion of complex and hybrid

283

N-glycans (Figure 3A, 3B and Table 2). By LC-MS intensity, pauci-mannose

284

Hex3HexNAc2 was the most common N-glycan in HCoV-19 S protein. Interestingly,

285

there was no evidence of sialic acid component in the N-glycan of HCoV-19 S

286

protein.

287

A total of 220 N-glycans was found in hACE2, with 78.2% of them being

288

complex type (Figure 3A), while hybrid, high-mannose and pauci-mannose glycan

289

only constitute 10.9%, 5.0% and 5.9%, respectively (Figure 3B and Table 3). By

290

LC-MS intensity, the most dominant hACE2 glycan was NeuGc1Hex5HexNAc4

291

which was predicted to be a bi-antennary complex containing a sialic acid end.

292

N-glycan profile in all hACE2 sites was primarily complex type. It is notable that N90,

293

N103 and N690 all contain more than 100 types of N-glycans, with their most

294

dominant N-glycan form all containing sialic acid.

295

Collectively, our LC-MSMS data confirms that both HCoV-19 spike protein and

296

its receptor hACE2 are indeed heavily N-glycosylated at most of its predicted

297

N-X-S/T sequon. Summary of most dominant N-glycan composition and predicted

298

structure in HCoV-19 spike protein and hACE2 were illustrated in Figure 3C.

By adding chemical structures of the most abundant N-glycans in each site based

303

on LC-MSMS results to the most updated cyro-EM model of HCoV-19 s protein and

304

hACE2, we generated atomic models that represented the most likely spatial

305

distribution of the N-glycans on both proteins (Fig. 3A and 3B). Despite 4 sites (N74,

306

N149, N1158, and N1194) of spike protein were not shown in the model for the

307

missing residues in model 6VXX, our model suggested the camouflaging N-glycans

308

shielded more than 2/3 of the HCoV-19 S protein surface, which could potentially

309

lead to host attachment and immune evasion. Additionally, both HCoV-19 s protein

and hACE2 model showed the glycans at N331, N343 of HCoV-19 s protein and N90

311

of hACE2 were in the proximity of, albeit not exactly inside of, the binding area of

312

both proteins (Fig. 3C and 3D). Model of S-hACE2 complex also showed that 3

313

methylation sites in hACE2 (57E, 68K and 329E) formed a trident structure which

314

enclosed the contact area formed between K353-R357 of hACE2 and N501 of

315

HCoV-19 S (Supplementary Figure 2).

316
317

Binding of HCoV-19 S protein and hACE2 does not depends on N-glycosylation

318

To understand the contribution of protein glycosylation to the interaction

319

HCoV-19 S protein with hACE2, we compared the binding kinetics and affinity of the

320

purified hACE2 ectodomain to glycosylated and deglycosylated HCoV-19 S-ECD

321

immobilized at the surface of biosensors in a BLI experiment. We found that hACE2

322

bound to HCoV-19 S pretreated with active or inactive PNGase F with comparable

323

equilibrium dissociation constants Kd of 1.7 nM (Figure 4A) and 1.5 nM (Figure 4B),

324

respectively. The affinity determined in this study for hACE2 binding to HCoV-19 S

325

is in line with (Walls et al., 2020a). Comparable affinity was also observed when

326

HCoV-19 S ECD was bound to the immobilized hACE2 (Kd = 16.7 nM, Figure 4C)

327

or deglycosylated hACE2 (Kd = 18.2 nM, Figure 4D). Detailed summary of BLI

328

binding kinetics can be found in Supplementary Table 3.

Discussion

331

Glycosylation is a ubiquitous and complex PTM that greatly extend the structural

332

and functional diversity for many proteins. However, comprehensive characterization

333

of protein N-glycosylation is technically challenging. In this study, deglycosylated

334

peptides which are easier to be analyzed by LC-MS than their glycosylated precursors,

335

were profiled to confirmed N-glycosylated sites in HCoV-19 S and hACE2. The O18

336

deamidation

337

identifications as the isotope was incorporated by PNGase F mediated hydrolysis in

338

H2O18. Intact N-glycopeptide analyses were then performed to further verify the

339

glycosites, and provided detailed information about the compositional and structural

modification significantly boost

the confidence

for

glycosite

340

heterogeneity of N-glycans associated with each site. Our investigation showed that

341

all sites except N17 were highly glycosylated in HCoV-19 S protein. According to the

342

N-linked glycan model of spike protein, a large proportion of the protein surface is

343

covered by glycans, which is consistent with that in previous reports (Walls et al.,

344

2020b; Wrapp et al., 2020). When compared spike proteins from HCoV-19 and

345

SARS-CoV, it is noticeable that the majority of differences of glycosylation sites

346

occurs in the distal S1 subunit, therefore leading to significant difference in glycan

347

profile in the outermost canopy of the virus formed by spike trimer clusters.

348

Alteration of glycosites might be the results of host or environmental selective

349

pressure, and could implicate dramatic difference in viral infectivity, pathogenesis and

350

host responses.

351

The N glycans in S protein are markedly heterogeneous, which greatly extends

352

conformational flexibility and epitope diversity. While a small proportion of complex

353

and hybrid N-glycans were found in S protein, most sites were occupied by

354

oligomannose glycans, which is in line with previous report on SARS-CoV (Krokhin

355

et al., 2003; Song et al., 2004; Ying et al., 2004). Many viral proteins are hallmarked

356

by high level of oligomannose-type glycans, probably as a sign of incomplete glycan

357

maturation due to high glycosite density that results in steric hindrance (Watanabe et

358

al., 2019). Interestingly, N343, the glycosite closet to the binding surface, is decorated

359

by the most diverse N-glycans and primarily by hybrid and complex forms. Moreover,

360

like in case of SARS-CoV and Marburg viral proteins (Feldmann et al., 1994; Ritchie

361

et al., 2010), we found that sialic acid incorporation in SARS-CoV spike protein

362

glycans is negligible. Regarding the ongoing global efforts to generate vaccine, which

363

primarily targets S protein as the candidate antigen, the diverse glycan forms

364

decorating large section of S trimer surface should be considered by vaccine

365

developers as they could drastically modulate the protein immunogenicity. We should

366

also expect that vaccines generated based on S proteoforms with different

367

glycosylation status could render varying efficacy against future infection.

368

The binding of coronavirus S proteins to their respective receptors has been

369

shown to be mediated by its oligomannose N-glycan (Li et al., 2017; Parsons et al.,
13

370

2019; Zheng et al., 2018). SARS-CoV spike protein contains 3 RBD-associated

371

glycosites (N318, N330 and N357), while HCoV-19 only has 2 (N331 and N343) that

372

surrounds the binding pocket. In contrary to our postulation that N-glycan at these two

373

sites might contribute polar interaction to receptor binding, the BLI binding assay

374

suggested deglycosylation did not change the affinity of SARS-CoV spike protein to

375

hACE2. However, this negative BLI binding results do not exclude the possibility that

376

glycosylation could affect other viral entry steps, including protease cleavage, and

377

glycans mediated interactions with DC/L-SIGN which were documented to enhance

378

viral entry in SARS-CoV (Han et al., 2007; Jeffers et al., 2004). Further investigations

379

are required to ascertain the role of glycosylation regarding the infectivity of

380

HCoV-19.

381

Antigen glycosylation greatly determines host immune responses. One of the

382

prominent consequence of viral envelope or surface proteins is immune evasion by

383

shield off immunogenic epitopes (Raman et al., 2016; Vigerust and Shepherd, 2007;

384

Yang et al., 2020). The complete occupancy of glycans in most glycosite of HCoV-19

385

S protein suggest the virus is able to invade the host in a stealth fashion. Successful

386

innate immune evasion by the HCoV-19 at the early stage of infection might explain

387

the long asymptomatic incubation period during which transmissible virion are

388

produced (Guan et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020). Cases of HCoV-19 reinfection were

389

also reported suggesting the virus is capable to escape from antibody-mediated

390

neutralization (Biswas et al., 2020). On the other hand, protein glycosylation can also

391

facilitate immune response by sensor molecules or antibodies specific for glycan

392

recognition. N-glycans are known ligands for galectins, which triggers inflammation

393

events such as cytokine release, immune cell infiltration (Robinson et al., 2019; Wang

394

et al., 2019), of which may contribute to the HCoV-19 pathogenesis and correlated

395

with the disease severity. Moreover, epidemiological studies have shown that ABO

396

polymorphism are linked to different susceptibility to both HCoV-19 and SARS-CoV

397

infections (Cheng et al., 2005; Zhao et al., 2020). Since the ABH carbohydrate

398

epitopes and viral protein glycans are likely to be synthesized by the same

399

ER-resident glycosylation enzymes, anti-A or -B antibodies could partially block the

400

viral-host interactions (Guillon et al., 2008), thereby with blood type O individuals

401

more resistant to virus infection. It remains to be explored if the glycosylation status

402

of S protein has implications in the inter-individual variation in terms of viral

403

response and clinical outcome within the infected population.

404

The glycosylation status of hACE2 was also profiled in this study. All 7

405

glycosites in hACE2 were completely occupied by glycan, including the N90 in the

406

vicinity of binding surface. However, we found the glycan did not directly contribute

407

to the its binding with HCoV-19 S protein. This is in agreement with previous

408

founding that the disruption of ACE2 glycosylation did not affect its binding of

409

SARS-CoV spike protein (Zhao et al., 2015). But deglycosylated ACE2 did

410

compromise the cellular entry and the subsequent production of infectious

411

SARS-CoV virion (Zhao et al., 2015). Therefore, ACE2 glycosylation was still

412

considered as an important target for intervention of coronavirus infection. In fact, the

413

ability of chloroquine to counter HCoV-19 infection was thought to be the results of

414

its inhibition ACE2 glycosylation in addition to its ability to increase endosomal pH

415

level (Liu et al., 2020; Vincent et al., 2005).

416

Additional PTM forms other than glycosylation were also investigated in this

417

study. Methylation was identified in several sites in both S protein and hACE2. In

418

particular, we found 57E, 68K and 329E in hACE2 that surrounding its binding site

419

with RBD of S protein are completed methylated. Methylation causes loss of charge

420

and increases hydrophobicity in these sites. Four hydroxyproline (253, 263, 321, 346)

421

were identified in the protease domain of hACE2. The extra hydroxyl group is like to

422

increase hydrophilicity of proline in this extracellular region of hACE2. Further study

423

is needed to investigate possible biological role of these PTMs. We did not found

424

phosphorylation and acetylation in our dataset as previous PTM investigation on

425

SARS-CoV also fail to identify these PTMs (Ying et al., 2004). Fatty acid acylations

426

were also been considered in our study since they are commonly found in surface

427

viral protein to facilitate membrane fusion and virus entry. However, our study found

428

no evidence of acylation PTM presence in HCoV-19 S protein. Given that our

429

multi-protease proteomic experiment provides almost full coverage for both proteins,

430

we believe the PTMome of HCoV-19 S protein and hACE2 mainly consist of

431

glycosylation, methylation and proline oxidation.
