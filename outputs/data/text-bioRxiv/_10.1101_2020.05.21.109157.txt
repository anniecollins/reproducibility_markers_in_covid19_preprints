Abstract:
A serious public health crisis is currently unfolding due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. SARSCoV-2 viral entry depends on an interaction between the receptor binding domain of the trimeric
viral Spike protein (Spike-RBD) and the dimeric human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)
receptor. While it is clear that strategies to block the Spike/ACE2 interaction are promising as antiSARS-CoV-2 therapeutics, our current understanding is insufficient for the rational design of
maximally effective therapeutic molecules. Here, we investigated the mechanism of Spike/ACE2
interaction by characterizing the binding affinity and kinetics of different multimeric forms of
recombinant ACE2 and Spike-RBD domain. We also engineered ACE2 into a split
Nanoluciferase-based reporter system to probe the conformational landscape of Spike-RBDs in
the context of the Spike trimer. Interestingly, a dimeric form of ACE2, but not monomeric ACE2,
binds with high affinity to Spike and blocks viral entry in pseudotyped virus and live SARS-CoV2 virus neutralization assays. We show that dimeric ACE2 interacts with an RBD on Spike with
limited intra-Spike avidity, which nonetheless contributes to the affinity of this interaction.
Additionally, we demonstrate that a proportion of Spike can simultaneously interact with multiple
ACE2 dimers, indicating that more than one RBD domain in a Spike trimer can adopt an ACE2accessible “up” conformation. Our findings have significant implications on the design strategies
of therapeutic molecules that block the Spike/ACE2 interaction. The constructs we describe are
freely available to the research community as molecular tools to further our understanding of
SARS-CoV-2 biology.

Introduction:
In late 2019, a novel, pathogenic coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) entered the human population and
has since spread throughout the world. The number of people suffering from the associated disease
(COVID-19) continues to rise, increasing the need for effective therapeutic interventions. SARSCoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 Spike proteins are highly homologous (~76% sequence identity). Similar
to SARS-CoV-1, the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and the angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on human cells is critical for viral entry into host cells (Gralinski &
Menachery, 2020; Tai et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020). SARS-CoV-2 Spike is an obligate trimer,
while ACE2 presents as a dimer on the cell surface (Chen, Liu, & Guo, 2020). Several highresolution structures of SARS-CoV-2 Spike receptor binding domain (Spike-RBD) bound to
ACE2 have been published (Lan et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2020). However, as of this writing,
structures of SARS-CoV-2 Spike trimer in complex with either the dimeric or monomeric form of
ACE2 have not been reported, resulting in an incomplete understanding of the nature of this
interaction.
Structural studies of trimeric SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 Spike protein demonstrate that each
of the Spike-RBDs, as in other coronaviruses, can undergo hinge-like movements to transition
between “up” or “down” conformations. The host ACE2 receptor can only interact with an RBD
in the “up” conformation, whereas the “down” conformation is inaccessible to ACE2 (Wrapp,
Vlieger, et al., 2020). The RBDs of SARS-CoV-1 Spike can rotate away from the “down” position
by different angles to an “up” position (Gui et al., 2017). Several cryo-EM structures report that
approximately half of the SARS-CoV-1 and 2 Spike particles are in the “three-down” closed
conformation and half in the “one-up” open conformation (Song, Gui, Wang, & Xiang, 2018;
Walls et al., 2020), while another cryo-EM study on SARS-CoV-1 Spike reported 39% of Spike
in the “two-up” conformation and 3% in the “three-up” conformation (Kirchdoerfer et al., 2018).
The different conformations of Spike observed by these cryo-EM studies may be affected and/or
limited by the properties of the grid and sample preparation conditions, and may also reflect
differences between SARS-CoV-1 and 2. Thus, it remains unknown how many RBDs of SARSCoV-2 are accessible within a trimeric Spike to bind ACE2 under physiological conditions, and
thus the degree to which intra-Spike avidity plays in the interaction of ACE2 with SARS-CoV-2
Spike. Recombinant ACE2 and an engineered dimeric ACE2-Fc fusion have been shown in several

studies to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 virus (Lei et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020; Monteil et al., 2020).
However, it remains unknown whether the dimeric form of ACE2 offers any affinity enhancements
through avidity compared to a monomer. Understanding the role and mechanism of intra-Spike
avidity in binding is important for engineering tight binding antagonists to neutralize virus
infection.
To elucidate the nature of the interaction between dimeric ACE2 and trimeric SARS-CoV-2 Spike,
we performed a thorough characterization of the binding interactions of the different multimeric
forms of Spike-RBD and ACE2 (Figure 1A). The results reveal that while both the ACE2
monomer and ACE2-Fc dimer can bind the isolated Spike-RBD, only the ACE2-Fc dimer can bind
tightly to the trimeric Spike ectodomain (FL-Spike). Interestingly, the affinity of the ACE2-Fc
dimer is much higher to the RBD-Fc dimer than to FL-Spike, suggesting that although intramolecular avidity plays a role in both interactions, its effect is compromised in the context of FLSpike. Consistent with this, we find that ACE2 associates more slowly to FL-Spike, which
indicates that the RBDs in FL-Spike protein are not readily accessible to ACE2. To further probe
the conformational landscape of the RBDs in FL-Spike, we engineered ACE2-Fc as splitNanoluciferase (NanoLuc) reporters. We found that a proportion of FL-Spike can interact with
multiple ACE2-Fc molecules simultaneously, indicating that more than one RBD domain in a
Spike trimer can adopt an “up” conformation. Using pseudotyped and SARS-CoV-2 virus
neutralization assays, we further show that ACE2-Fc dimer is much more potent at neutralizing
virus than ACE2 monomer. These findings extend our biochemical insight into how a Spike trimer
binds to an ACE2 dimer, and have important implications for how multimeric therapeutic
molecules, such as dimeric ACE2 or antibody-based biologics, can effectively target SARS-CoV2.
Results:
Design and generation of different multimeric Spike/ACE2 proteins
To study the interaction between ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 Spike, we constructed a panel of Spike
and ACE2 proteins in various multimeric formats (Figure 1A). Trimeric SARS-CoV-2 Spike
ectodomain (aa 1-1213) (FL-Spike) was expressed and purified as described (Amanat et al., 2020).
The construct generously provided by the F. Krammer Lab has the furin cleavage site removed, a

pair of stabilizing mutations and a C-terminal T4 trimerization motif followed by a 6xHis tag added.
These modifications have been widely used for structural analysis (Gui et al., 2017; Kirchdoerfer
et al., 2018; Song et al., 2018; Walls et al., 2020; Wrapp, Wang, et al., 2020). We designed a
dimeric form of the Spike Receptor Binding Domain (aa 328-533) (Spike-RBD-Fc) containing a
TEV-cleavable Fc-fusion molecule with a C-terminal Avi tag for biotinylation (Czajkowsky, Hu,
Shao, & Pleass, 2012). We also generated a monomeric form of Spike-RBD (aa 328-533) (SpikeRBD-monomer) with a C-terminal TEV-8xHis-Avi. The human ACE2 ectodomain contains a Nterminal peptidase domain (aa 18-614) and a C-terminal dimerization domain (aa 615-740). We
designed the monomeric form of ACE2 (aa 18-614) (ACE2-monomer) with a C-terminal TEV8xHis-Avi tag, and the dimeric form of ACE2 (aa 18-614) (ACE2-Fc) as a TEV-cleavable Fcfusion molecule with a C-terminal Avi tag (Czajkowsky et al., 2012). All of the ACE2 and Spike
proteins were expressed in BirA-ER-expressing Expi293 cells (Howarth et al., 2008; Martinko et
al., 2018).
The Fc-fusion molecules were purified by Protein A affinity chromatography, and the Spike-RBDmonomer and FL-Spike by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography (Figure 1B, 1C). However, the
ACE2 monomer did not express but was generated instead by TEV release from ACE2-Fc (Figure
1A, 1B). All these proteins, except the ACE2 monomer were >95% biotinylated during expression
(Figure 1B), facilitating their use on avidin-functionalized surfaces and beads. Size exclusion
chromatography was performed to confirm the oligomerization state of the different proteins. FLSpike, Spike-RBD-Fc, ACE2 monomer, and ACE2-Fc all eluted at their expected elution times
(Figure 1D), indicating successful generation of the different multimeric forms of Spike and
ACE2 proteins. The Spike-RBD-monomer eluted later than expected, but further analysis of the
associated SEC fractions by SDS-PAGE showed the pure protein at the correct molecular weight
(Supplementary Figure 1). Differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) of ACE2-Fc and ACE2
monomer showed these two proteins had similar Tm values (Supplementary Figure 2).
ACE2 dimerization is important for binding to the trimeric SARS-CoV-2 Spike
To understand how oligomerization affects Spike/ACE2 interaction, we determined the affinity
and binding kinetics of the different Spike-RBD and ACE2 proteins by bio-layer interferometry
(BLI) (Figure 2). Spike-RBD-monomer, Spike-RBD-Fc and FL-Spike were immobilized on

Streptavidin or Ni-NTA sensors, and allowed to bind ACE2 monomer or ACE2-Fc in solution. A
four-fold avidity effect was observed for the Spike-RBD-monomer/ACE2-Fc interaction (KD =
5.5 nM, Figure 2D) compared to the Spike-RBD-monomer/ACE2-monomer interaction (KD =
22.4 nM, Figure 2A). In contrast, the Spike-RBD-Fc/ACE2-Fc interaction (KD < 10-12 M, Figure
3E) showed >1000-fold increase in binding affinity compared to the Spike-RBD-Fc/ACE2monomer interaction (KD =13.2 nM, Figure 2B). This dramatic increase in affinity is driven by a
massive decrease in the off rate and little change in on rate, which indicates a strong intramolecular
two-on-two avidity between Spike-RBD-Fc and ACE2-Fc.
We next tested binding of ACE2 monomer and ACE2-Fc to FL-Spike to determine the affinity
and avidity effect. Surprisingly, we found that the binding interaction between ACE2 monomer
and FL-Spike is very weak and could not be measured accurately (Figure 2C). By contrast, the
ACE2-Fc interacts with FL-Spike with a KD of 5.9 nM, similar to the affinity for the isolated
Spike-RBD-monomer (Figure 2F). This suggests that the presence of two ACE2 molecules in
close proximity in ACE2-Fc is essential for a productive interaction with FL-Spike, and that a
single ACE2 monomer is not sufficient to bind an RBD on FL-Spike. However, the affinity
between FL-Spike/ACE2-Fc interaction was substantially less than Spike-RBD-Fc/ACE2-Fc
interaction (KD < 10-12 M, Figure 2E), suggesting that the high-avidity two-on-two interaction is
compromised in the context of FL-Spike. This could be due to geometric/steric constraints or the
unique conformations of the RBDs in the FL-Spike context. When FL-Spike is loaded to a much
higher density on the BLI sensor (load to 2.0 nm) and probed with ACE2-Fc, we see that avidity
can be recovered (Supplementary Figure S3A). This indicates that if Spike is presented at high
density, the ACE2-Fc arms can engage two RBDs if neighboring Spike trimers are close enough.
In contrast, monomeric ACE2 did not bind FL-Spike strongly even when FL-Spike was loaded
until saturation, further demonstrating the importance of ACE2 dimerization for interacting with
FL-Spike (Supplementary Figure S3B).
Interestingly, the kon of the FL-Spike/ACE2-Fc interaction (Figure 2C and 2F) is ~10-fold lower
than the interactions between Spike-RBD-monomer or Spike-RBD-Fc with ACE2 or ACE2-Fc
(Figure 2A, 2B, 2D, and 2E), while the koff is also ~10- to 20-fold lower. The decreased kon
suggests that the RBDs in FL-Spike protein may have to undergo a conformational change for

binding to ACE2. Previous cryo-EM studies on SARS-CoV-2 FL-Spike show that approximately
half of the particles have the three RBD domains in the “down” conformation (Walls et al., 2020).
Molecular dynamics simulations of SARS-CoV-2 FL-Spike suggest that the RBD exists in a series
of conformations between the “down” and “up” states, and any RBD with an angle lower than
52.2° from the body of the trimer are inaccessible to ACE2 (Peng et al., 2020). Our data supports
that a significant proportion of the RBDs in FL-Spike protein are in a “closed” or partially “closed”
state inaccessible to ACE2, and the RBD has to open up to allow binding to ACE2. The decreased
koff, on the other hand, suggests that the presence of multiple RBDs within the context of a FLSpike could slow down the dissociation of ACE2-Fc.
Split reporter assays indicate more than one RBD in a Spike trimer can be in the “up”
conformation when it binds ACE2
To further investigate the RBD conformational landscape in FL-Spike, we designed a splitNanoLuc system to orthogonally probe the Spike/ACE2 interaction. Split-NanoLuc enzymes, in
particular NanoBiT (Promega), have been broadly used to detect protein-protein interactions and
to study analyte concentrations (Dixon et al., 2016). The NanoBiT system is composed of LgBiT
and SmBiT. SmBiT is an 11 amino acid peptide which has a low intrinsic affinity to LgBiT (KD =
190 µM), but when SmBiT and LgBiT are in close proximity, the two subunits assemble to form
an active luciferase enzyme. To interrogate the interaction between ACE2 and Spike, we
engineered ACE2-Fc reporter molecules where SmBiT or LgBiT were fused at the N- or C-termini
(Figure 3A). All constructs expressed at high yield and purity (Figure 3B, 3C).
To functionally validate the split reporter system, we immobilized Spike-RBD-Fc on streptavidin
magnetic beads at high-density. Incubation with 1 nM of ACE2-Fc-SmBiT and ACE2-Fc-LgBiT,
or 1 nM of SmBiT-ACE2-Fc and LgBiT-ACE2-Fc with substrate showed dose-dependent
luminescence signal, consistent with an assembled functional split enzyme reporter and
intermolecular proximity (Figure 3D, 3E). We found the N-terminal fusion reporter pair showed
higher sensitivity compared to the C-terminal fusion reporter pair (Supplementary Figure S4)
suggesting that the increased entropy from the flexible linker and Fc domain reduces productive
luciferase reconstitution.

We next used these split reporters to interrogate the soluble FL-Spike trimer (Figure 3F, 3G).
Increasing concentrations of soluble FL-Spike were incubated with ACE2-Fc-SmBiT/LgBiT or
SmBiT/LgBiT-ACE2-Fc, followed by the addition of substrate. The SmBiT/LgBiT-ACE2-Fc
reporters showed dose-dependent increase in luminescence signal with 1-10 nM FL-Spike. This
result suggests that although FL-Spike cannot form a high-avidity two-on-two interaction with
both arms of ACE2-Fc at a time, there is a proportion of FL-Spike proteins with “two-up” or
perhaps even “three-up” RBDs that can simultaneously interact with multiple ACE2-Fc molecules.
We cannot resolve if these “two-up” or “three-up” conformations are present prior to ACE2
binding, or appear because ACE2 binding induces a conformational change, which enables two or
more of the RBD domains to engage in the binding to a second ACE2-Fc domain.
Pseudotyped virus and SARS-CoV-2 virus neutralization assays show that dimeric ACE2Fc can efficiently block viral entry
To translate these studies to cells, we compared the ability of ACE2 monomer and ACE2-Fc to
neutralize SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus to infect cells. Pseudotyped HIV-1 particles carry the
wildtype SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and are capable of delivering a NanoLuc luciferase reporter
gene to ACE2-expressing HEK293T cells. Cells and pseudovirus were pre-incubated with serially
diluted ACE2-Fc or monomeric ACE2, and luciferase activity was measured in cell lysates at 48
hours post infection. ACE2-Fc neutralized the SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped particles at an IC50 =
0.96 µg/mL (4.75 nM), while ACE2 monomer did not substantially neutralize at the concentrations
we tested, up to 48 µg/mL (237.5 nM) (Figure 4A, 4B). This stark difference in efficacy between
monomeric and dimeric ACE2 confirms that ACE2 monomer binds poorly to Spike.
We further tested the ability of ACE2-Fc and ACE2 monomer to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 virus.
SARS-CoV-2 live virus was pre-incubated with 100 nM of ACE2-Fc or ACE2 monomer prior to
infecting VeroE6 cells, a monkey kidney epithelial cell line broadly used for studying viral
infectivity. 16 hours post infection, cells were lysed and intercellular viral and host RNA was
isolated, converted to cDNA, and quantified by qPCR. Consistent with the pseudotyped virus
neutralization results, ACE2-Fc neutralized SARS-CoV-2 much more potently than ACE2
monomer (Figure 5A, 5B).

Discussion:
Worldwide efforts are currently underway to develop effective and fast-acting clinical
interventions to control the spread and mortality of SARS-CoV-2. While it is clear that the
interaction between ACE2 and Spike-RBD plays a crucial role in viral entry, our current
understanding is insufficient for the design of maximally effective therapeutic options. In this work,
we systematically interrogated how an ACE2 dimer interacts with SARS-CoV-2 Spike trimer to
understand the fundamental avidity properties of the Spike/ACE2 interaction.
The results from the BLI experiments, split reporter assays, and virus neutralization assays provide
important insight into the conformational landscape of the RBDs in SARS-CoV-2 Spike and are
summarized in Figure 6A. The decreased kon of ACE2-Fc suggests the majority of RBDs in FLSpike are in an ACE2-inaccessible, “down” conformation, which requires opening up for binding
ACE2 (Figure 6A). The poor binding of monomeric ACE2 (Figure 6B) and strong binding to
dimeric ACE2-Fc (Figure 6C) indicate intra-Spike avidity and ACE2 rebinding plays an important
role in promoting this interaction. However, while we observed a highly productive avidity effect
for the Spike-RBD-Fc/ACE2-Fc interaction, we did not observe the massive two-on-two avidity
for the FL-Spike/ACE2-Fc interaction (Figure 6D). This weaker interaction could be due to RBD
conformations in Spike, or a sub-optimal geometry of the two proteins for high-avidity binding.
Nonetheless, we show that two or more of the RBD domains can be in the “up” conformation
allowing binding of two ACE2-Fc on one Spike trimer (Figure 6E). This is evidenced in our BLI
experiment where once bound to FL-Spike, the presence of the other RBDs slows down the
dissociation of ACE2-Fc (Figure 2F in comparison to 2D). This is further shown in the splitNanoLuc reporter experiments where ACE2 domains from two separate ACE2-Fc split-reporters
can simultaneously bind a Spike trimer to generate an active luciferase (Figure 3). Together these
results indicate that trimeric SARS-CoV-2 Spike interacts with ACE2 with limited but important
intra-Spike avidity.
In addition to intra-Spike avidity, inter-Spike avidity could contribute to the improved affinity of
ACE2-Fc especially in the intact virus. It is possible that ACE2-Fc could bridge two Spike
molecules on the viral surface and bind with increased avidity, similar to what we observed in the
high-density loading BLI experiment (Supplementary Figure 3A). Previous structural studies of

SARS-CoV-1 shows the Spike proteins are densely distributed (Lin et al., 2004), with ~100 Spike
molecules displayed on a viral particle with a diameter of ~100 nm (Beniac, Andonov, Grudeski,
& Booth, 2006; Neuman et al., 2006). Using values from these studies, we estimate an inter-Spike
distance of ~180 Å. The structure of the native ACE2 dimer (PDB: 6M17) shows that the two
ACE2 arms (~80 Å apart) would not be able to span this predicted inter-Spike distance. An ACE2
monomer fused Fc with flexible linker (ACE2-Fc) may be sufficient to only bridge two Spikes
that are <150 Å apart. Structural studies of IgGs have shown the antigen binding sites in the Fab
arms on a flexible-hinge region of an Fc to be roughly ~117-134 Å apart (Sosnick et al. 1992).
This would still fall short of the inter-Spike distance. However, these estimates are based on a rigid
membrane where Spike proteins are uniformly distributed and also do not account for
heterogeneity in Spike presentation across viral particles. This may not be the case as
coronaviruses are an enveloped virus with a fluid lipid membrane that allows for Spike protein
mobility and clustering, and potentially enable inter-Spike binding by ACE2 dimers or IgGs.
Indeed, cryo-EM images of SARS-CoV-1 show irregularity and lack of symmetry of Spike
distribution on the coronavirus envelope (Beniac et al., 2006). As there are no direct reports of
inter-Spike avidity for dimeric ACE2, further experiments are needed to thoroughly examine the
Spike/ACE2 interaction on the viral surface.
While all cryo-EM structural studies to date on SARS-CoV-2 Spike have identified only the
“closed” or “one-up” RBD conformation (Cao et al., 2020; Pinto et al., 2020; Walls et al., 2020;
Wrapp, Wang, et al., 2020), our split reporter assay identified a population of Spike in “two-up”
or “three-up” conformation. The relative population of these RBD conformers and whether they
exist in an ACE2-unbound state or emerge only upon ACE2 binding remains unknown (Figure
6F). Previous studies have suggested that ACE2 binding could lead to conformational change in
SARS-CoV-1 or 2 Spike (Song et al., 2018; Yuan et al., 2020). Molecular dynamic simulation of
SARS-CoV-2 Spike bound to ACE2 found that there is significant flexibility in the RBD
conformation (Peng et al., 2020), and an EM study of SARS-CoV-1 Spike reported that the
distribution of the RBD conformers was very different in the ACE2-bound structure compared to
the unbound structure (Kirchdoerfer et al., 2018). In accordance with these studies, our results
support the model that ACE2 binding induces a conformational change in Spike and enables two
or more RBDs to be in the “up” conformation (Figure 6F). This complex and dynamic nature of

the Spike/ACE2 interaction is likely to play a key role in the biology of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
We anticipate that further characterization of the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 Spike and
native ACE2 will elucidate the exact nature of this binding.
Furthermore, our findings have important ramifications in developing a successful protein
therapeutic for COVID-19. Recombinant ACE2 proteins or antibodies which can block the host
ACE2-viral Spike interaction are promising as anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics. The much higher
potency of ACE2-Fc in comparison to ACE2 monomer we observed in the live virus neutralization
assays suggest that monovalent therapeutics such as ACE2 monomers or Fab domains will likely
be much less effective than multimeric formats such as dimeric ACE2 ectodomain (Monteil et al.,
2020), ACE2-Fc (Lei et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2020) or IgG (Figure 6G). Finally, our results
highlight the importance of understanding the ACE2-Spike interaction in the context of the FLSpike trimer. We also hope that the Spike and ACE2 constructs generated here are useful tools to
the greater research community to enable better understanding of SARS-CoV-2 biology.

Materials and Methods:
Plasmids construction
Plasmids were constructed by standard molecular biology methods. The FL-Spike plasmid was a
generous gift from the Pak lab (Chan Zuckerberg Initiative Biohub) and Krammer lab (Icahn
School of Medicine at Mount Sinai). The DNA fragments of Spike-RBD, ACE2 and LgBiT were
synthesized by IDT Technologies. The Spike-RBD-TEV-Fc-AviTag, ACE2-TEV-Fc-AviTag,
Spike-RBD-8xHis-AviTag, ACE2-8xHis-AviTag plasmids were generated by subcloning the
Spike-RBD or ACE2 DNA fragment into a pFUSE-hIgG1-Fc-AviTag vector (adapted from the
pFUSE-hIgG1-Fc vector from InvivoGen). The ACE2-Fc-LgBiT fusion plasmids were generated
by subcloning the gene fragments of LgBiT to the N- or C-terminus of the ACE2-TEV-Fc-AviTag
vector with a 10-amino acid (N-terminal fusion) or 5-amino acid (C-terminal fusion) linker. The
SmBiT tag in the ACE2-Fc-SmBiT fusion plasmids was generated by overlap-extension PCR,
which also has a 10-amino acid (N-terminal fusion) or 5-amino acid (C-terminal fusion) linker to
the ACE2 or Fc domains. The C-terminal AviTag was removed from all the ACE2-Fc reporter
plasmids. Complete plasmid sequences are available upon request.
Expression and purification of ACE2 and Spike constructs
The ACE2 and Spike proteins were expressed and purified from Expi293 BirA cells according to
established protocol from the manufacturer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Briefly, 30 µg of pFUSE
(InvivoGen) vector encoding the protein of interest was transiently transfected into 75 million
Expi293 BirA cells using the Expifectamine kit (Thermo Fischer Scientific). Enhancer was added
20 h after transfection. Cells were incubated for a total of 3 d at 37 °C in an 8% CO2 environment
before the supernatants were harvested by centrifugation. Fc-fusion proteins were purified by
Protein A affinity chromatography and His-tagged proteins were purified by Ni-NTA affinity
chromatography. Purity and integrity were assessed by SDS/PAGE. Purified protein was buffer
exchanged into PBS and stored at -80 °C in aliquots.
Generation of ACE2 monomer
ACE2 monomer was obtained by TEV treatment of ACE2-Fc and subsequent purification. 50 µl
Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen) and 50 µl Neutravidin resin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were washed
with PBS-25 mM imidazole twice and combined in 100 µl PBS-25 mM imidazole. Next, 20 µg

His-Tagged recombinant TEV protease and 1 mg purified ACE2-Fc protein were mixed, and the
reaction tube was rotated at 4 °C for 30 minutes. The cleavage reaction was then incubated with
the washed beads, rotating, at 4 °C for 30 minutes. While the incubation occurred, an additional
25 µl of magnetic Protein A beads and 25 µl or Ni-NTA beads were prepared as described before.
Supernatant from the first bead clearance was transferred to the newly prepared beads and allowed
to incubate for an additional 30 minutes at 4 °C. To remove beads from the protein supernatant,
reaction mixture was spin filtered at 1000 g for 2 min and washed with an additional 250 uL of
PBS-25 mM imidazole. The His-tagged TEV, biotinylated Fc, and the uncut ACE2-Fc remained
on the beads while the monomeric ACE2 was isolated in the flow-through. The purity of
monomeric ACE2 was confirmed by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. Purified protein was buffer
exchanged to PBS and store at -80 °C in aliquots.
Differential scanning fluorimetry
To assess the stability of proteins, we measured the melting temperature (Tm) by doing differential
scanning fluorimetry (DSF) as the method described previously (Hornsby et al., 2015). Briefly,
purified protein was diluted to 0.5 µM or 0.25 µM in DSF buffer containing Sypro Orange 4x
(Invitrogen) and PBS. 10 µL of reaction mixture was transferred to one well of a 384-well PCR
plate. Duplicate was prepared as needed. In a Roche LC480 LightCycler, the reaction was heated
from 30°C to 95°C with a ramp rate of 0.3°C per 30 sec. The intensities of the fluorescent signal
at an ~490 nm and ~575 nm (excitation and emission wavelengths) were continuously collected.
The curve peak corresponds to the melting temperature of the protein. Data was processed and Tm
was calculated using the Roche LC480 LightCycler software.
In vitro binding experiments
Biolayer interferometry data were measured using an Octet RED384 (ForteBio). Biotinylated
Spike or Spike RBD protein were immobilized on the streptavidin (SA) biosensor (ForteBio).
After blocking with biotin, purified ACE2 proteins in solution was used as the analyte. PBS with
0.05% Tween-20 and 0.2% BSA was used for all diluents and buffers. A 1:1 monovalent binding
model was used to fit the kinetic parameters (kon and koff).
Magnetic bead and solution based NanoBiT assays

For the Spike-Fc magnetic bead assay, magnetic beads were prepared by taking 100 µL of
Streptavidin Magnesphere Paramagnetic Particles (Promega) and incubated with 5 µM of SpikeFc-AviTag for 30 minutes, rotating at room temperature. Following, the beads were blocked with
10 uM biotin for 10 minutes. The beads were washed three times with PBS + 0.05% Tween +
0.2% BSA. 10 µL of 10-fold dilutions of the beads were incubated with 10µL of premixed 2 nM
ACE2-Fc-SmBiT and ACE2-Fc-LgBiT fusions. The sample was incubated shaking at room
temperature for 20 minutes. NanoGlo Lucfierase substrate (Promega) diluted in NanoGlo
Luciferase buffer was added to each well (15 µL) and luminescence was measured on a Tecan
M1000 plate reader after 10 minutes. For the FL-Spike detection, 10 µL of FL-Spike dilutions
were combined with 10 µL of premixed 2 nM SmBiT-ACE2-Fc and LgBiT-ACE2-Fc. Samples
were incubated with substrate and luminescence was detected as described above.
Pseudotyped virus neutralization assay
HEK293T cells overexpressing full-length ACE2 carrying two inactivating mutations in the
catalytic domain (H374N & H378N) were generated using standard lentivirus transduction. The
cells were maintained in DMEM (Gibco) with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum,
Gentamycin and 5 µg/ml Blasticidin.
Pseudotyped HIV-1 particles expressing the SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein and NanoLuc
luciferase as a reporter were generated by transfection of HEK293T cells with pNL4-3DEnvNanoLuc and pSARS-CoV2-Strunc. pNL4-3DEnv-NanoLuc was derived from pNL4-3 (Adachi et
al., 1986) by inserting a 940 bp deletion after the vpu stop-codon, resulting in loss of Envexpression. The NanoLuc Luciferase reporter gene (Nluc, Promega) was inserted in place of bp 1100 in the nef-frame. pSARS-CoV2-Strunc was generated by insertion of a human-codon optimized
gene encoding for 19 AAs C-terminally truncated SARS-CoV-2 Spike (Geneart) into pCR3.1.
Supernatants containing virus were harvested and filtered 48 hr post transfection and used for
infection of ACE2-overexpressing 293T cells. Pseudotyped virus was pre-incubated with serially
diluted ACE2-Fc or ACE2 monomer at 37 °C for 1 hr before addition to cells., Cells were washed
twice with PBS 48 hr post infection and lysed with Luciferase Cell Culture Lysis 5x reagent
(Promega). Relative luminescence units were normalized to those derived from cells infected with

SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus in the absence of Ace2-Fc/Ace2 monomer. The half maximal
inhibitory concentration (IC50) was determined using 4-parameter nonlinear regression (GraphPad
Prism). Each concentration of Ace2-Fc/Ace2 monomer was tested in duplicate and reported as an
average and standard deviation for each experiment. Two biological replicates of ACE2-Fc
treatment were obtained (exp #1, exp #2).
SARS-CoV-2 virus neutralization assay
All handling and experiments using SARS-CoV-2 was conducted under Biosafety Level 3
containment with approved BUA and protocols. SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolate 2019-nCoV/USAWA1/2020 was obtained through BEI Resources (Harcourt et al., 2020). Prior to experiments,
virus was passed in Vero E6 cells to create working stocks and titers were measured by plaque
formation assay. For experiments, Vero E6 cells were cultured in Minimal Essential Media (MEM),
10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), 1% Pen-Strep and seeded on 6-well culture plates at 3.8E5
cells/well the day prior. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 was performed using MOI of 0.1. Virus was
incubated in infection media (EMEM 0% FBS) containing 100 nM monomeric ACE2, 100 nM
dimeric ACE2-Fc, or no blocker for 1 hour at 37 °C. Culture media was removed from Vero E6
cells and 300 µL of the blocker/virus inoculum was added for 1 hour at 37 °C. Subsequently, 1
mL of cell culture media was added and cells were incubated at 37 °C for an additional 16 hours
before RNA harvest.
Viral entry into cells and cellular transcription of viral genes was measured by qPCR. Cellular
RNA was isolated and converted to cDNA using RNAeasy RNA extraction kit (Qiagen) and
Quantitect Reverse-transcriptase kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer instructions. qPCR
reactions were prepared using SYBR Select Master Mix (Thermo) and the following conditions:
for N gene, E gene, and hGUSB gene primer (cross reactive with Cercopithecus aethiops)
concentration was 400 nM and annealing temperature was 58 °C, and for hACTB gene primer
(cross reactive with Cercopithecus aethiops) concentration was 500 nM and annealing temperature
was

60 °C.

Figure 2. BLI characterization of binding affinity and kinetics of Spike and ACE variants
Bio-layer Interferometry (BLI) data of ACE2 monomer or ACE2-Fc dimer binding to immobilized
Spike RBD-monomer, RBD-Fc dimer, or trimeric FL-Spike ectodomain. Spike variants were
loaded onto sensors until binding was between 0.4-0.6 nm. ACE2 monomer or ACE2-Fc were
used as analytes in solution, with concentrations ranging from 100 nM to 3.125 nM. Although
ACE2 monomer bound Spike-RBD-monomer and Spike-RBD-Fc at KD of 18.5 and 12.0 nM,
respectively, it did not bind FL-Spike strongly (A-C). In contrast, the ACE2-Fc dimer bound to
these forms with affinities of 5.5 nM, <1 pM, and 5.9 nM (D-F). Although ACE2-Fc can bind
Spike-RBD-Fc with strong intramolecular avidity, this 2-on-2 interaction is not present in the
context of FL-Spike, indicating that only one arm of ACE2-Fc can engage an RBD in FL-Spike.
The decreased kon and koff of ACE2-Fc in the context of FL-Spike (F) compared to Spike-RBDmonomer (D) indicates that conformational changes of the RBD in the context of the Spike trimer
are important in the interaction of ACE2-Fc to FL-Spike.

ACE2 NanoBiT split luciferase constructs. (B) SDS-PAGE gel showing expression and
purification of ACE2 fusions. All show a major band at the expected molecular weight of the
dimer. (C) All of the ACE2 split-reporter fusions had good yields (>5 mg/L). (D) Cartoon
depiction of the N-terminal ACE2 NanoBiT sensor system to detect Spike-RBD-Fc bound to
streptavidin magnetic beads. (E) The N-terminal ACE2 NanoBiT system is able to detect SpikeRBD-Fc bound magnetic beads with better sensitivity than the C-terminal fusions
(Supplementary Figure S4). (F) Cartoon depiction of the N-terminal ACE2 NanoBiT sensor
system to detect FL-Spike in solution. (G) The N-terminal ACE2 NanoBiT system is able to detect
FL-Spike in solution, indicating that more than one RBD in a FL-Spike trimer can be in the “up”
conformation for two ACE2-Fc molecules to bind and reconstitute the split enzyme. For all assays,
the luminescence signal is normalized to a no-bead control and the average and standard deviation
is plotted (N=3).

Figure 4. ACE2-Fc neutralizes pseudotyped virus more potently than ACE2 monomer.
(A) Neutralization of luciferase-encoding pseudotyped lentivirus expressing SARS-CoV-2 Spike
glycoprotein. Pseudotyped virus pre-incubated with ACE2-Fc or ACE2 monomer at indicated
concentrations was used to infect HEK293T cells overexpressing ACE2. Luciferase activity in cell
lysates were determined at 48 hours post infection and normalized to no treatment control. (B) The
half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) was obtained for the two ACE-Fc treatment by fitting
the normalized data to a 4-parameter nonlinear regression. The average IC50 between two two
biological replicates of ACE2-Fc treatment was 0.98 µg/ml (4.8 nM).

Figure 5. ACE2-Fc neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 live virus more potently than ACE2 monomer.
SARS-CoV-2 live virus pre-incubated with 100 nM of ACE2-Fc or ACE2 monomer was used to
infect VeroE6 cells. 16 hours post infection, cells were lysed and intercellular RNA was isolated
and converted to cDNA. Viral entry and cellular transcription of viral genes was measured by
qPCR. Relative copy number of viral N or E gene transcript for each treatment arm was determined
using either (A) host gene GUSB (hGUSB) or (B) host gene ACTB (hACTB) as the reference
control. Primers are cross reactive between Homo sapiens and Cercopithecus aethiops (VeroE6
cells).

Figure 6. Model of the ACE2/Spike interaction and therapeutic strategies. (A) The majority
of FL-Spike proteins are in the “closed” or partially “closed” conformation and “opening up” of
RBD on Spike is necessary for ACE2 binding. (B) Monomeric ACE2 binds poorly to trimeric
Spike, (C) ACE2-Fc binds much stronger to Spike than monomer, indicating that rebinding and
intra-Spike avidity contribute significantly to the high-affinity nature of this interaction. (D)
Dimeric ACE2-Fc does not interact with FL-Spike with a full two-on-two intramolecular avidity.
(E) More than one RBD can be in the “up” conformation, enabling the engagement of separate
ACE2 molecules. For (B-E), only the “two-up” conformation is shown but other RBD
conformations are also possible. (F) A proposed model where ACE2 binding may induce a
conformational change in Spike, resulting in “two-up” or “three-up” RBD conformations. (H)
Dimeric molecules such as ACE2-Fc or IgG will be more potent than a monomeric inhibitor for
neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 virus. For all panels, RBD in the “open” conformation is colored in
green and RBD in the “closed” formation colored in grey.

Supplementary Figure 3: Saturating FL-spike on biosensor reveals intermolecular avidity of
ACE2-Fc. FL-Spike was loaded onto sensors until saturation. (A) ACE2-Fc was used as analytes
in solution, with concentrations beginning at 100 nM to 3.125 nM at 2-fold dilutions. The affinities
for the ACE2 dimeric to saturating trimeric FL-Spike was 0.33 nM, or 18-fold higher in affinity
compared to non-saturating conditions (5.9 nM, Figure 2F). (B) ACE2 monomer did not bind FLSpike strongly even when FL-Spike was loaded until saturation.
