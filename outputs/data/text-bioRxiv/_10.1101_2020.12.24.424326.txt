Abstract
Development of effective adaptive immune responses after coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
and after vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 is predicated on recognition of viral peptides, presented in
the context of HLA class II molecules, by CD4+ T-cells. We capitalised on extensive high resolution
HLA data deposited in the National Marrow Donor Program registry to obtain detailed information
on human HLA haplotype frequencies of twenty five human populations and used a bioinformatics
approach to investigate the role of HLA polymorphism on SARS-CoV-2 immunogenicity at the
population and at the individual level. Within populations, we identify wide inter-individual
variability in predicted CD4+ T-cell reactivity against structural, non-structural and accessory SARSCoV-2 proteins, according to expressed HLA genotype. However, we find similar potential for antiSARS-CoV-2 cellular immunity at the population level, across all ethnic groups examined, suggesting
that HLA polymorphism is unlikely to account for observed disparities in clinical outcomes after
COVID-19 among different race and ethnic groups. We predict robust immune reactivity against
SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, the basis for the majority of current vaccination efforts, both at the
population and individual level, despite significant variation in Spike-derived peptide presentation by
individual HLA genotypes. Finally, we provide comprehensive maps of SARS-CoV-2 proteome
immunogenicity accounting for population coverage in major ethnic groups. Our findings provide
important insight on the potential role of HLA polymorphism on development of protective
immunity after SARS-CoV-2 infection and after vaccination and a firm basis for further experimental
studies in this field.

Introduction
The new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), responsible for coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19), has caused an ongoing pandemic with 75,704,857 confirmed cases and
1,690,061 deaths worldwide (as of 21 December 20201). Several risk factors for severe COVID-19 are
now well-established, including age, gender, obesity and various co-morbidities such as diabetes,
cancer and cardiovascular or chronic lung disease2, 3, 4, 5. There is, however, an urgent need to better
understand the role of race and ethnic differences on health outcomes. Several studies have
highlighted a disproportionate prevalence of COVID-19 infections, higher rates of hospitalisation,
and increased incidence of death in people from black and minority ethnic groups but the underlying
reasons for these observations are not well understood2, 6, 7, 8, 9.
Even after accounting for well-known risk factors, there is still wide inter-individual clinical variability
of COVID-19 outcomes within considered risk groups, which may reflect underlying genetic
differences10.The principal genetic region involved in immunity against viral pathogens is the Major
Histocompatibility Complex encompassing the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) loci. HLA class I (HLAA, -B, -C) and HLA class II (HLA-DR, -DQ, -DP) proteins present viral peptides for recognition by CD8+
and CD4+ T-cells, respectively. The latter orchestrate adaptive anti-viral immunity and drive B-cell
activation and maturation for robust humoral responses. Extensive polymorphism is observed in the
HLA system, resulting in differences in HLA allele frequency both within and across human
populations. HLA genotype can be a determining factor in development of protective immunity and,
in turn, may account for part of the observed heterogeneity in measured immune responses and in
clinical outcomes after SARS-CoV-2 infection11, 12, 13. It is also well established that there is marked
biological variation in how individuals respond and maintain immunity after vaccination which is, in
part, attributable to genetic factors14. It is, therefore, important to consider the role of HLA
polymorphism when designing viral subunit or peptide vaccine formulations and in assessing
population coverage and likelihood of immune protection after vaccination15.
When considering the role of the HLA system in COVID-19 susceptibility and vaccine responses, it is
essential to account for differences in HLA allele frequencies across human populations and,
importantly, for the linkage disequilibrium between HLA loci that result in population-specific
haplotype frequencies. Here, we utilise information on human HLA haplotype frequencies of twenty
five human populations (four broad population categories and twenty one detailed population
subcategories) at an unprecedented scale, capitalising on the extensive high-resolution HLA data
deposited in the National Marrow Donor Program Registry, to compute population level immune
responses against SARS-CoV-2 based on predicted high-affinity binding of viral proteome derived

peptides by HLA class II molecules. Overall, we find similar potential for anti-SARS-CoV-2 cellular
immunity across all populations examined suggesting that HLA polymorphism is unlikely to account
for observed disparities in clinical outcomes after COVID-19 among different race and ethnic groups.
However, within populations, we identify wide variability among individuals in predicted CD4+ T-cell
reactivity against structural, non-structural, and accessory SARS-CoV-2 proteins, according to HLA
genotype. Nevertheless, we predict robust immune reactivity against the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein,
the basis for the majority of current vaccination efforts, both at the population and at the individual
level.

Methods
SARS-CoV-2 viral proteome and identification of potential T-cell epitopes
Full viral proteome sequences for SARS-CoV-2 were downloaded from UniProt16. FASTA-formatted
protein sequence data for each protein and protein class were examined individually and in
combination. We produced potential peptides of 15 amino acids length (15mers), using sliding
windows over the entire proteome. Proteins of fewer than 15 amino acids in length were not
examined. Analyses were performed considering proteins individually, some protein domains
individually, and in groupings of proteins (both the whole proteome, and all structural, nonstructural, and accessory proteins).
HLA population frequency computation
HLA population frequencies were obtained from US unrelated stem cell donor registry National
Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) / Be The Match. High resolution HLA Class II haplotype frequencies
(DRB1, DRB3/4/5, DQA1, DQB1, DPA1 and DPB1 loci) were estimated using an expectationmaximization algorithm (as described by Gragert et al. 201317) utilising a cohort of 8.9 million US
volunteer donors (NMDP/Be The Match registry snapshot 29/05/2020) HLA typed by molecular
methods (supplementary Table 1 showing number of individuals genotyped). US population
categories were developed based on a race/ethnicity questionnaire included on the donor consent
form. There were four broad population categories (European American, African American, Asian or
Pacific Islander and Hispanic) and 21 detailed populations subcategories (African American, African
Black, South Asian Indian, American Indian - South or Central American, Alaska native of Aleut, North
American Indian, Caribbean Black, Caribbean Hispanic, Caribbean Indian, European Caucasian,
Filipino, Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, Japanese, Korean, Middle Eastern or North Coast of
Africa, Mexican or Chicano, Chinese, Hispanic - South or Central American, Black - South or Central
American, Southeast Asian, Vietnamese). Some individuals had membership only within a broad
population category.

Following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium proportions, multi-locus HLA Class II genotypes were
generated by randomly sampling two haplotypes from the same population HLA haplotype
frequency distribution. Simulated genotypes were generated for each of the four broad and 21
detailed population groups, with ten replicates at each population of size 1,000, 5,000 and 10,000.
For population-based analyses at the haplotype level, we analysed haplotypes up to 99% cumulative
coverage within each population. HLA alleles, when examined individually, included all HLA alleles
present in any of these selected haplotypes for the four broad and 21 detailed population groups.
Computational peptide-HLA prediction model for T-cell epitope selection
Peptide binding affinity was assessed for all HLA that featured in haplotypes in any of the ethnic
populations studied using NetMHCpan v4.018. Peptides were examined both for their predicted
binding affinity (nM) and their percentage rank (compared to a pool of representative peptides for
that HLA). Peptides were counted as binding if their binding affinity was equal to or less than 500nM
and their percentage rank was equal to or greater than 2% (default parameter for strong HLA class II
peptide binders). The NetMHCIIpan-4.0 programme also identifies the predicted 9-mer binding core.
Total predicted peptide counts for an individual HLA per protein or per whole proteome were
calculated by counting peptides only if they were both unique to one another (i.e a unique 15-mer),
but also if the predicted binding core (9-mer) was also unique. This prevented the count from
appearing falsely elevated due to sequential overlapping peptides which were presenting the same
core, from being counted twice. Total predicted peptide counts for an HLA haplotype or genotype
similarly required the peptide and the peptide binding core to be unique, except in this case the
peptide could be presented in any of the HLA expressed in the haplotype or genotype.
Statistical analysis
Classification performance of peptide-MHC scoring models was calculated using scikit-learn19 in
Python using the sklearn.metrics.roc_auc_score (AUROC), sklearn.metrics.average_precision_score
(Average Precision), sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score (Accuracy), and
sklearn.metrics.classification_report (Sensitivity and Specificity) functions. Population comparisons
of peptide scores were performed by calculating the mean and standard deviation using NumPy in
Python, and between repeat population simulations using statistics.shaipro (Shapiro-Wilk test for
normality) and statistics.kruskal (Kruskal–Wallis one-way analysis of variance) both in Python.

Results
Experimental approach
The principal objective of our study was to examine whether genetic variation at the HLA loci may
influence immune responses, and therefore COVID-19 clinical outcomes or response to vaccination,
among patients from different ethnic populations. HLA class II molecules present peptides from
exogenous antigens for CD4+ T-cell recognition and are therefore critical components for an effective
adaptive immune response that incorporates humoral (B-cell) and cytotoxic (CD8+ T-cell) arms.
We analysed peptide binding for all classical HLA class II loci (HLA-DRB1, -DRB3/4/5, -DQA1, -DQB1,
and -DPA1, -DPB1). The main analysis focused on four broad population categories, African
Americans (AFA), European Caucasians (CAU), Hispanics (HIS) and Asian/Pacific Islanders (API) and
sub-analysis included 21 detailed population subgroups of these broad categories. To account for
linkage disequilibrium between HLA class II loci, we analysed HLA haplotypes rather than assuming
allele frequencies were independent at each locus. HLA haplotype frequencies were estimated
utilising HLA genotype data obtained from a cohort of approximately 8.9 million donors (NMDP/Be
The Match registry; supplementary Table 1). We analysed a total of 25,128 unique haplotypes to
enable 99% coverage of each population which in turn required the analysis of 803 HLA class II
molecules (see supplementary information). Supplementary Figure 1 depicts the number of distinct
HLA-DRB1, -DRB345 alleles and HLA-DQA1/DQB1, DPA1/DPB1 heterodimers examined and
associated haplotype coverage in each population. To confirm the robustness of our observations at
the individual level, we analysed multiple replicate genotype samples and demonstrate with
replicate sets of simulated genotypes of 10,000 individuals that HLA diversity, as measured by the
alpha parameter fits to the power law distribution, was stable, and the number of unique haplotypes
needed to reach 95% cumulative frequency was also stable across replicates (supplementary Table
6).
Immunogenic T-cell epitopes were identified using the full-length reference SARS-CoV-2 sequence20
with 9,744 amino acids, which was subdivided into the four structural proteins (E, M, N, and S) and 7
additional open reading frames encoding non-structural proteins (NSP1-16) and accessory proteins
(proteins 3a, 6, 7a, 7b, 8 and 10). A sliding window of 15 amino acids length was used and, to
minimise redundancy, peptides were only counted towards totals if the HLA class II binding core was
unique. To evaluate peptide binding and stable display by HLA class II molecules we employed
NetMHCIIpan-4.0 which outputs predicted peptide-HLA binding affinity (IC50) in nanomolar units
and percentile rank of binding affinity compared to a set of 100,000 random natural peptides. The
percentile rank enables incorporation of information from the biological antigen presentation

pathway in addition to the peptide-MHC binding event18, 21. We aimed to detect strongly binding
peptides and, therefore, elected to use a threshold of ≤2% percentile rank (default parameter for
HLA class II strong peptide binding) combined with an affinity threshold ≤500nM18. To further
increase the stringency of criteria for prediction of peptide binding, such that we maximise precision
and reduce the rate of false positive peptides (accepting we may not recall all possible peptides that
could be displayed), we also explored a model involving a threshold of ≤0.5% percentage rank and
≤500nM binding affinity. Finally, we examined a binding affinity threshold of ≤50nM, as previously
suggested15. To validate the computational models we analysed publicly available datasets of
experimentally determined, immunogenic SARS-CoV-2 peptides. We focused on the two largest
datasets recently described by Snyder et al22, 23 (336 HLA class II peptides) and by Mateus et al24 (135
HLA class II peptides) that contain peptides from the entire SARS-CoV-2 proteome. We also
examined two relatively small datasets encompassing 9 nucleocapsid and 25 structural proteinderived (Spike, nucleocapsid or membrane) peptides25, 26. In the aforementioned datasets, the HLA
restriction was not known and validation focused on positive identification of experimental peptides
by the computational models (supplementary information). Finally, we used an HLA-DRB1*04:01
restricted peptide dataset determined using an in vitro peptide-HLA stability assay27. Our analyses
showed that scoring peptide binding based on a combination of ≤2% percentile rank and ≤500nM
binding affinity achieved the best true positive rate (sensitivity) for predicting experimentally derived
SARS-CoV-2 peptides (supplementary Table 2). Similarly, in the HLA restricted dataset by Prachar et
al, the combined ≤2% percentile rank and ≤500nM binding affinity threshold had an AUROC of 0.85
and provided the best combination of precision and specificity in classifying stable peptide binders
compared to alternative scoring methods (supplementary Table 3). It was also notable that using a
50nM threshold, without accounting for binding characteristics of natural peptides, resulted in 46%
of HLA alleles examined lacking presentation of any SARS-CoV-2 peptides and a bias towards HLA-DR
as the major SARS-CoV-2 peptide presenting molecules (supplementary Figure 2). Nevertheless, we
have confirmed key aspects of our analyses using both a ≤0.5% percentage rank in combination with
a ≤500nM peptide binding affinity threshold, and using a ≤50nM peptide binding affinity threshold
alone. Overall, a total of 9,590 15-mer peptides, derived from all 11 SARS-CoV-2 genes, were
examined and 4,289 peptides were predicted to bind strongly according to our defined criteria to at
least one HLA class II molecule.
SARS-CoV-2 viral proteome presentation at the molecular HLA class II level
We first examined presentation of viral epitopes by all HLA class II molecules contained in
haplotypes representing 99% of the four major broad ethnic populations. Assessment of
presentation capacity at the entire viral proteome level (Figure 1A) showed that the majority of HLA

class II molecules are capable of presenting SARS-CoV-2 peptides, albeit with significant variability.
HLA-DR alleles have the highest viral peptide presentation capacity followed by HLA-DP and, to a
significantly lower extent, HLA-DQ molecules. Notably, certain common individual HLA molecules
were predicted to have very limited ability to present viral peptides, including
DQA1*03:01~DQB1*02:01 (no peptide presentation from any protein within the SARS-CoV-2
proteome; with frequency of 3.2% within AFA haplotypes, <0.01% within API haplotypes, 0.1%
within CAU haplotypes and 0.5% within HIS haplotypes), DRB1*03:02 (two peptides presented in
total from the entire proteome; with frequency of 6.3% within AFA haplotypes, 0.01% within API
haplotypes, 0.04% within CAU haplotypes and 1.0% within HIS haplotypes). Consistent with its
known high immunogenicity28, 29, 30, 31, Spike protein derived peptides showed strong binding for the
majority of HLA class II molecules although presentation capacity again varied and was lowest (no
peptides presented) for relatively common alleles such as DQA1*01:01~DQB1*05:03, with a
frequency of 1.9-5.4% in each of the four broad population groups (Figure 1B). This observation was
more prominent for Nucleocapsid derived peptides where strong binding was predicted to be absent
in 117 out of 306 HLA molecules found in 99% of haplotypes in the four broad ethnic populations
(mostly reflecting HLA-DP molecules and to some extent -DQ molecules; Figure 1C). Similar findings
were noted for the relatively small Membrane and Envelope structural proteins, with the latter
predicted to be non-immunogenic for the majority of common HLA class II molecules (Figures 1D-E).
For non-structural proteins, HLA class II presentation capacity was variable and dependent upon
protein amino acid sequence length (data not shown).
SARS-CoV-2 proteome immunogenicity at the population level
The capacity of individuals to present viral peptides for recognition by CD4+ T-cells depends on the
composition of their HLA class II alleles in their inherited haplotypes. Given variation in populationspecific HLA haplotype frequencies, we hypothesised that potential differences in SARS-CoV-2
proteome immunogenicity (as reflected by HLA class II peptide presentation) at the population level
may reflect disparities in capacity for effective anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunity which could in turn
influence response to vaccination or underpin observed variability in COVID-19 clinical outcomes
among different ethnic populations. To investigate this hypothesis, we examined viral proteome
presentation by HLA class II, accounting for the distribution of HLA haplotypes in a population. This
analysis showed that the overall capacity for HLA peptide presentation, at the whole SARS-CoV-2
proteome level, among the four broad ethnic populations examined was remarkably similar (Figure
2A). This was also the case considering T-cell epitopes from each SARS-CoV-2 protein
(supplementary Table 4), suggesting that polymorphism at the HLA genomic region is unlikely to
underpin potential differences in immune responses and, thus, in clinical outcomes among ethnic

groups. It was notable, however, that within ethnic populations the capacity of individual HLA
haplotypes to present viral peptides varied widely, with the top 5% of haplotypes predicted to
present between 497 and 591 peptides from the entire viral proteome (such as
DRB1*04:01~DRB4*01:01~DQA1*03:01~DQB1*03:01~DPA1*01:03~DPB1*04:01 which represents
1% of AFA haplotypes, 0.14% of API haplotypes, 3.9% of CAU haplotypes and 0.9% of HIS haplotypes,
predicted to present 506 SARS-CoV-2 peptides) as opposed to 5% of haplotypes at the opposite end
of the spectrum predicted to present approximately 316 viral peptides or fewer (e.g.
DRB1*03:01~DRB3*01:01~DQA1*05:01~DQB1*02:01~DPA1*02:01~DPB1*01:01 which represents
0.25% of AFA haplotypes, 0.02% of API haplotypes, 3.5% of CAU haplotypes and 1.4% of HIS
haplotypes, predicted to present 258 peptides). This observation suggests that individual capacity to
mount CD4+ T-cell immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 is not uniform and is likely dependent on
HLA phenotype. Similar inter-individual variability was noted for peptide presentation derived from
structural and from non-structural proteins as well as for distinct SARS-CoV-2 proteins examined
(Figure 2B-E and Supplementary Figure 3). Recent experimental studies suggested that up to 70% of
CD4+ T-cell responses against SARS-CoV-2 target the Spike, Membrane and Nucleocapsid antigens11;
our analysis showed the predicted CD4+ T-cell response to these structural proteins is highly variable
at the haplotype level (Figure 2B-D). In agreement with the observed immunogenicity of Spike
protein in experimental studies28, 29, 30, 31, relatively high numbers of Spike-derived peptides were
predicted to be recognised both within and across ethnic populations (Figure 2B). In contrast, our
analysis suggests that on average 13.9% of HLA haplotypes within each population have low capacity
(≤2 peptides) to present Nucleocapsid-derived peptides (e.g.
DRB1*03:02~DRB3*01:01~DQA1*04:01~DQB1*04:02~DPA1*02:02~DPB1*01:01 which presents one
peptide, and accounts for 4.98% of haplotypes found in AFA populations and 0.44% in HIS
populations, although it is rare in API and CAU populations; Figure 2C). This inter-individual
variability may, in part, account for the heterogeneity in the presence and magnitude of CD4+ T-cell
and antibody responses against the Nucleocapsid protein noted in recent COVID-19 studies11, 32, 33.
Among non-structural viral proteins, our analysis suggested NSP3, NSP4 and NSP12 as the most
immunogenic, in part reflecting their size, in each population (supplementary Figure 3). The above
noted similarity in overall capacity for SARS-CoV-2 peptide presentation among different populations
was also observed at different (more stringent) thresholds for HLA-peptide binding, albeit with even
higher individual variability within ethnic populations (500nM binding affinity and ≤0.5% percentage
rank or ≤50nM binding affinity; supplementary Figure 4).
To further explore the consequences of the above observations at the individual level, and given that
every individual expresses two HLA haplotypes, we generated 10 replicates each of random

genotype datasets encompassing 1,000, 5,000 and 10,000 simulated individuals for each population,
as described in the methods. Populations encompassing 10,000 individuals achieved >95%
cumulative HLA haplotype coverage in every population. As shown in Figure 3, this analysis
confirmed equivalent HLA class II presentation of SARS-CoV-2 peptides across all four broad ethnic
populations, both at the entire viral proteome level and for individual proteins (supplementary Table
4). As noted for the HLA haplotype analysis, there was wide inter-individual variability in predicted
potential for CD4+ T-cell immune responses, according to HLA genotype. We noted significant, but
variable, capacity for T-cell reactivity against the entire Spike glycoprotein across individuals,
whereas reactivity against the Nucleocapsid protein was predicted to be weaker for 10% of
individuals in each population, on average (range 7.8-13.3%, as defined by HLA presentation of less
than 5 nucleocapsid peptides). These observations were confirmed (but, again, inter-individual
variability was higher) using more stringent thresholds for defining HLA class II peptide presentation
(data not shown). In further analysis, we considered immune reactivity against the Receptor Binding
Domain (RBD) of Spike glycoprotein, as it represents a proposed target of coronavirus subunit
vaccines currently in clinical trials34, 35, 36. Although, overall, there was no significant difference in
predicted CD4+ T-cell reactivity at the population level, there were notable differences at the
individual level (both based on HLA haplotype and on genotype analyses) with wide variation in
predicted RBD specific peptide presentation (Figure 3F). The above analyses were consistent
irrespective of the size of the population sampled and among the 10 replicates at each population
size (Kruskal-Wallis test p-value >0.05 for peptide comparisons at the population level).
We next examined HLA class II presentation of SARS-CoV-2 peptides for a further 21 detailed
population subgroups, as described above (Figure 4/supplementary Table 4). Overall, analysis of the
entire viral proteome identified similar capacity for HLA class II viral peptide presentation across
population subgroups. This was also the case for structural proteins, including Spike and RBD,
mirroring the findings above for the broad population groups. Although we did not identify SARSCoV-2 vulnerability of particular populations at the HLA level, again we observed inter-individual
variation in predicted cellular immunity within ethnic groups. This was reflected in the range of
predicted viral peptide presentation within simulated populations of 10,000 individuals including 24112 for Spike, 4-25 for RBD, 1-24 for Nucleocapsid and 208-854 for the entire proteome
(Supplementary Table 4).
Immunogenicity maps of SARS-CoV-2 proteome at the population level
The effectiveness of peptide and subunit vaccine formulations against SARS-CoV-2 depends on
robust presentation by individual HLA class II molecules and, therefore, investigated vaccines should
account for linkage disequilibrium and HLA haplotype frequencies in different ethnic populations to

achieve universal coverage. Capitalising on extensive HLA haplotype frequency data from the NMDP
/ Be The Match registry, we generated maps of SARS-CoV-2 immunogenicity for the entire viral
proteome. This analysis showed that each viral protein contains immunogenic peptide segments
with variable degree of population coverage which is, on the whole, similar across different
populations for a given protein region, as well as peptide segments of variable length that are nonimmunogenic in any population (Figure 5). Similar observations were made for coronavirus subunit
components that are being investigated as potential vaccines with several immunogenic peptides
predicted to achieve universal coverage across population groups (Figure 5). This was particularly
evident for the Spike protein underlying its inherent immunogenicity and its potential as vaccination
target. Supplementary Table 5, depicts SARS-CoV-2 immunogenic peptide segments predicted to
cover over 90% of HLA genotypic variation in every broad ethnic group examined.

Discussion
Recognition of SARS-CoV-2 peptides in the context of HLA class II molecules is essential for CD4+ Tcell activation and proliferation which, in turn, orchestrate the development of effector cellular
(CD8+ T-cell) and humoral adaptive immune responses after viral infection and after vaccination. In
this computational study, we investigated the role of HLA on SARS-CoV-2 immunogenicity at the
individual and at the population level, considering population-specific HLA allele, haplotype, and
genotype frequencies. We accounted for genetic polymorphism and for HLA linkage disequilibrium
in twenty five ethnic populations by capitalising on, to our knowledge, the most extensive HLA
haplotype frequency information to date to predict SARS-CoV-2 specific CD4+ T-cell epitopes
covering the entire viral proteome. We find that the overall capacity for anti SARS-CoV-2 cellular
immunity according to HLA class II genotype is similar at the population level across all ethnic groups
examined. However, we identify wide inter-individual variability in predicted CD4+ T-cell reactivity
against every SARS-CoV-2 protein according to expressed HLA genotype. We predict robust immune
reactivity against the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, the basis for the majority of current vaccination
efforts, both at the population and at the individual level regardless of population origin. Finally, we
provide comprehensive maps of SARS-CoV-2 proteome immunogenicity accounting for population
coverage in ethnic groups.
Several recent studies have examined the cellular immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and revealed
strong associations between the T-cell response and COVID-19 severity29, 37. Although this
relationship is complex to untangle when the peripheral T-cell repertoire is sampled during the acute
phase, it is notable that SARS-CoV-2 specific CD4+ T-cells have been associated with lessened COVID19 severity and that high frequency of Spike-specific CD4+ T-cell responses were observed in patients

who had recovered from COVID-1911, 29, 38, 39. A coordinated and regulated response involving all
branches of adaptive immunity (CD4+, CD8+ and antibody responses) is likely required to reduce
COVID-19 severity, with the cellular response being key for both initiating the adaptive response and
for controlling the acute infection29. Even though neutralising antibody titres are not predictive of
disease severity29, 40, humoral responses are a key aspect of protective immunity after infection and
critical for generating sterilising immunity after vaccination34, 41. In this respect, current evidence
suggests a strong association between the magnitude of Spike-specific CD4+ T-cells and neutralising
antibody titres11, 30, 38. Finally, the majority of recent literature on anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunity
indicates there is a high degree of heterogeneity in the breadth and magnitude of both humoral and
cellular responses to SARS-CoV-2 both at the individual patient level and in relation to specific viral
proteins11, 29, 33. Within this context, the observation that patients with severe COVID-19 had
decreased diversity of T-cell responses suggested that recognition of multiple SARS-CoV-2 T-cell
epitopes may be required for development of protective immunity after infection or after
vaccination42.
The above observations on anti-SARS-CoV-2 cellular immunity from experimental studies and the
role of HLA in shaping the diversity of the T-cell repertoire43, 44, place the findings of our study into
context. With regards to susceptibility to COVID-19, we hypothesised that genetic variation at the
HLA complex may account for observed differences in clinical outcomes between ethnic groups2, 45,
. We performed a comprehensive analysis of HLA haplotypes and genotypes covering 99% of

46

genetic HLA variation within twenty five ethnic populations and showed that the predicted CD4+ Tcell response is overall remarkably similar at the population level both looking at the entire SARSCoV-2 proteome and for individual viral proteins. This observation is supported by more nuanced
recent investigations which show equivalent COVID-19 clinical outcomes after adjustment for
potential socioeconomic and clinical confounders7, 8. We did, however, find significant interindividual variability in predicted SARS-CoV-2 proteome immunogenicity according to HLA
phenotype. This variability was more pronounced for particular viral proteins, such as nucleocapsid,
membrane protein and envelope protein and less evident when the entire viral proteome was
considered where, even at the lower end of the spectrum, HLA haplotypes were predicted to
present a significant number of CD4+ T-cell epitopes. Given the relevance of diversity and magnitude
of cellular immunity against SARS-CoV-2, as discussed above, it is tempting to speculate that HLA
phenotype might underpin some of the observed inter-individual variability in COVID-19 outcomes,
along with more established clinical factors. This might depend on the relative contribution of SARSCoV-2 proteins to the quality of the immune response. For example, Grifoni et al11 have shown that
up to 70% of CD4+ T-cell responses against SARS-CoV-2 target the Spike, Membrane and

Nucleocapsid antigens whereas significant reactivity was also noted against nsp3, nsp4 and ORF8.
Despite significant differences between the highest and lowest peptide presenting HLA haplotypes,
we noted substantial numbers of Spike-specific CD4+ T-cell peptides presented by the majority of
HLA haplotypes in all ethnic groups examined; in comparison, inter-individual variability according to
HLA haplotype was more pronounced for the remaining of the above, and other, viral proteins.
Whether this observation might translate into differential clinical outcomes or levels of protective
immunity according to expressed HLA type would need a large clinical study that encompasses a
cohort representative of the HLA polymorphism within a particular population. Certainly, evidence
supporting an important role of HLA class II in viral immunity has been previously reported47, 48. The
current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic represents a unique opportunity to address such fundamental
questions which have recently started to be explored49.
It is also well established that individual response, including efficacy and relative antibody levels, and
maintenance of immunity after vaccination varies markedly and this biological variation results from
a combination of environmental (such as age, size, sex, comorbid status, ethnicity, and dose and
route of vaccine administration) and genetic factors14, 48. Non-responsiveness affects approximately
2-10% (and up to 20% following hepatitis B vaccination) of vaccinated healthy individuals50, 51. HLA
class II haplotype plays a central role in the presentation of vaccine epitopes and is a known genetic
risk factor for primary vaccination failure50, 52, 53. Given that the majority of current vaccination
efforts are focused on generating immunity against the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, we calculated
the number of Spike-specific CD4+ T-cell epitopes according to HLA genotype. Our analysis suggests
that immune reactivity against Spike is likely to be robust both at the population level, including all
25 ethnic groups examined, and at the individual level. This finding is now supported experimentally
by studies reporting high degree of seroconversion against Spike after natural infection and after
vaccination28, 30, 33, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59. Nevertheless, we noted inter-individual variation ranging from 112
peptides for the highest presenting HLA class II genotypes to 24 for the lowest. Whether such
variation may affect the magnitude and diversity of protective immunity generated after vaccination
requires further study but it is notable that variation in the degree of cellular immunity has been
reported with a few vaccine formulations55, 58, 60.
It is important to acknowledge the limitations of our study. We used a computational approach to
predict SARS-CoV-2 peptides presented by HLA class II molecules, however, peptide presentation
does not always lead to CD4+ T-cell activation; peptide recognition is complex and incompletely
understood and is influenced by many factors, including relative expression of individual viral
proteins61. Nevertheless, NetMHCIIpan-4.0 is an established and validated algorithm for T-cell
epitope prediction that has recently been updated resulting in improved performance21. Recent

computational studies investigating SARS-CoV-2 vaccine immunogenicity have based their approach
for T-cell epitope selection exclusively on peptide-HLA binding affinity incorporating different
thresholds (e.g. 500nM or 50nM) and identified population coverage gaps in predicted cellular
immunity15, 62, 63, 64. This approach is affected by inherent bias of certain HLA molecules towards
higher or lower mean predicted affinities; thus, we show that the 50nM binding affinity threshold,
one of the most commonly used, is heavily biased towards HLA-DR as the main SARS-CoV-2 peptide
presenting locus with the majority of HLA-DQ and -DP molecules showing no peptide binding.
Accordingly, using a 50nM binding affinity threshold for defining peptide immunogenicity resulted in
very wide inter-individual variability in predicted CD4+ T-cell reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 proteins
(supplementary Figure 4). To overcome this limitation, we incorporated both binding affinity
prediction and percentile rank, compared to a set of 100,000 random natural peptides, for epitope
selection. Notwithstanding that currently there is limited information on experimentally determined
SARS-CoV-2 immunogenic T-cell epitopes and even less information on peptide HLA restriction, we
have used available information in the published literature to validate our approach. We focused on
prediction of strongly HLA binding peptides and demonstrated that our peptide selection threshold
correctly identified the majority of experimentally determined immunogenic viral peptides in the
largest published datasets22, 24. We also aimed to minimise the rate of false positive peptides and
showed, in a limited experimental SARS-CoV-2 peptide dataset with HLA restrictions published by
Prachar et al20, that our 500nM binding affinity and ≤2% rank threshold for peptide selection,
achieves high precision and specificity (1.0 for both). Finally, we confirmed that our observations on
SARS-CoV-2 immunogenicity, both in relation to the comparison of population level responses and in
relation to inter-individual variability, remained valid when we used more stringent peptide
selection criteria (500nM and ≤0.5% rank) and the commonly used 50nM binding affinity threshold.
In conclusion, we present a rigorous immune-informatics approach to evaluate the potential for
cellular immunity against SARS-CoV-2 at the population and at the individual level capitalising on, to
our knowledge, the most comprehensive assessment of HLA genetic variation to date. Our findings
provide important insight on the potential role of HLA polymorphism on development of protective
immunity after SARS-CoV-2 infection and after vaccination and a firm basis for further experimental
studies in this field.

Figure 3. SARS-CoV-2 derived peptide presentation at the HLA genotype level (broad population
groups). Panels depict the number of SARS-CoV-2 peptides presented by individual HLA class II
genotypes in simulated populations of 10,000 individuals for four broad population groups (African
Americans, Asian Pacific Islanders, Caucasians and Hispanics). A. Whole Proteome. B. Spike protein
(S protein). C. Nucleocapsid protein (N protein). D. Membrane protein (M protein). E. Envelope
protein (E protein). F. Receptor Binding Domain of Spike protein. The width of each step in the
curves is proportional to the relative frequency of a specific HLA genotype. The boxplot charts depict
the median, interquartile range (box) and range (whiskers - excluding outliers) for the number of
viral peptides presented at the population level for each of the above ethnic groups.
Figure 4. SARS-CoV-2 derived peptide presentation at the HLA genotype level (detailed population
subgroups).
The top panel (A) shows boxplot charts depicting the median, interquartile range (box) and range
(whiskers - excluding outliers) for the number of viral peptides (from the entire SARS-CoV-2
proteome) presented at the population level for each of 4 broad population groups and 21 detailed
ethnic population subgroups (shown on the right inset). Panels B-G depict the number of SARS-CoV2 peptides presented by individual HLA class II genotypes in simulated populations of 10,000
individuals for each of the 21 population subgroups. B. Whole Proteome. C. Spike protein (S protein).
