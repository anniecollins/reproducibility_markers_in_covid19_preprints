Abstract

43

Combating the COVID-19 pandemic requires potent and low-cost therapeutics.

44

We identified a novel series of single-domain antibodies (i.e., nanobody), Nanosota-1,

45

from a camelid nanobody phage display library. Structural data showed that Nanosota-1

46

bound to the oft-hidden receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein,

47

blocking out viral receptor ACE2. The lead drug possessing an Fc tag (Nanosota-1C-Fc)

48

bound to SARS-CoV-2 RBD with a Kd of 15.7picomolar (~3000 times more tightly than

49

ACE2 did) and inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection with an ND50 of

50

0.16microgram/milliliter (~6000 times more potently than ACE2 did). Administered at a

51

single dose, Nanosota-1C-Fc demonstrated preventive and therapeutic efficacy in

52

hamsters subjected to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Unlike conventional antibody drugs,

53

Nanosota-1C-Fc was produced at high yields in bacteria and had exceptional

54

thermostability. Pharmacokinetic analysis of Nanosota-1C-Fc documented a greater than

55

10-day in vivo half-life efficacy and high tissue bioavailability. Nanosota-1C-Fc is a

56

potentially effective and realistic solution to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Introduction
The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has led to the COVID-19 pandemic,

60

devastating human health and the global economy (1, 2). Anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs are

61

urgently needed to treat patients, save lives, and revive economies. Yet daunting

62

challenges confront the development of such drugs. Though small molecule drugs could

63

theoretically target SARS-CoV-2, they can take years to develop and their use is often

64

limited by poor specificity and off-target effects. Repurposed drugs, developed against

65

other viruses, also have low specificity against SARS-CoV-2. Therapeutic antibodies can

66

be identified and generally have high specificity; however, their expression in

67

mammalian cells often leads to low yields and high production costs (3, 4). A realistic

68

therapeutic solution to COVID-19 must be potent and specific, yet easy to produce.

69

Nanobodies are unique antibodies derived from heavy chain-only antibodies

70

found in members of the camelidae family (llamas, alpacas, camels, etc.) (Fig. S1) (5, 6).

71

Because of their small size (2.5 nm by 4 nm; 12-15 kDa) and unique binding domains,

72

nanobodies offer many advantages over conventional antibodies including the ability to

73

bind cryptic epitopes on their antigen, high tissue permeability, ease of production and

74

thermostability (7, 8). Although small, nanobodies bind their targets with high affinity

75

and specificity due to an extended antigen-binding region (7, 8). Furthermore, it has been

76

documented that they have low toxicity and immunogenicity in humans, if any (7, 8).

77

One drawback of nanobodies is their quick clearance by kidneys due to their small size;

78

this can be overcome by adding tags to increase the molecular weight to a desired level.

79

Underscoring the potency and safety of nanobodies as human therapeutics, a nanobody

80

drug was recently approved for clinical use in treating a blood clotting disorder (9).

81

Additionally, due to their superior stability, nanobodies can be inhaled to treat lung

82

diseases (10) or ingested to treat intestine diseases (11). Nanobodies are currently being

83

developed against SARS-CoV-2 to combat COVID-19 (12, 13). However, to date, none

84

of the reported nanobodies have been evaluated for therapeutic efficacy in vivo.

85

The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is a prime

86

target for therapeutic development (14). The spike protein guides coronavirus entry into

87

host cells by first binding to a receptor on the host cell surface and then fusing the viral

88

and host membranes (15, 16). The RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and a closely related SARS-

89

CoV-1 both recognize human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as their receptor

90

(14, 17-19). Previously, we showed that SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 RBDs both

91

contain a core structure and a receptor-binding motif (RBM), and that SARS-CoV-2

92

RBD has significantly higher ACE2-binding affinity than SARS-CoV-1 RBD due to

93

several structural changes in the RBM (20, 21). We further showed that SARS-CoV-2

94

RBD is more hidden than SARS-CoV-1 RBD in the entire spike protein as a possible

95

viral strategy for immune evasion (22). Hence, to block SARS-CoV-2 binding to ACE2,

96

a nanobody drug would need to bind to SARS-CoV-2 RBD more tightly than ACE2.

97

Here, we report the development of a novel series of anti-SARS-CoV-2 nanobody

98

therapeutics, Nanosota-1. Identified by screening a camelid nanobody phage display

99

library against the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, the Nanosota-1 series bound potently to the

100

SARS-CoV-2 RBD and were effective at inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. The

101

best performing drug, Nanosota-1C-Fc, demonstrated preventative and therapeutic

102

efficacy in a hamster model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nanosota-1C-Fc was produced at

103

high yields easily scalable for mass production and was also found to have a

104

pharmacologically relevant in vivo half-life and excellent bioavailability. Our data

105

suggest that Nanosota-1c-Fc may provide an effective solution to the COVID-19

106

pandemic.

Results

109

Nanosota-1 was identified by phage display

110

For the rapid identification of virus-targeting nanobodies, we constructed a naïve

111

nanobody phage display library using B cells isolated from the spleen, bone marrow, and

112

blood of nearly a dozen non-immunized llamas and alpacas (Fig. 1). Recombinant SARS-

113

CoV-2 RBD, expressed and purified from mammalian cells, was screened against the

114

library to identify RBD-targeting nanobodies. Select nanobody clones were tested in a

115

preliminary screen for their ability to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus entry into

116

target cells (see below for more details about the assay). The nanobody that demonstrated

117

the highest preliminary neutralization potency was named Nanosota-1A and then

118

subjected to two rounds of affinity maturation. For each round of affinity maturation,

119

random mutations were introduced to the whole gene of Nanosota-1A through error-

120

prone PCR, and mutant phages were selected for enhanced binding to SARS-CoV-2

121

RBD. Nanobodies contain four framework regions (FRs) as structural scaffolds and three

122

complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) for antigen binding. The nanobody after

123

the first round of affinity maturation, named Nanosota-1B, possessed one mutation in

124

CDR3 and two other mutations in FR3 (near CDR3). Affinity maturation of Nanosota-1B

125

resulted in Nanosota-1C, which possessed one mutation in CDR2 and another mutation

126

in FR2. We next made an Fc-tagged version of Nanosota-1C, termed Nanosota-1C-Fc, to

127

create a bivalent construct with increased molecular weight.

128

Nanosota-1 tightly bound to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and completely blocked out

129

ACE2

130

To understand the structural basis for the binding of Nanosota-1 drugs to SARS-

131

CoV-2 RBD, we determined the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 RBD complexed with

132

Nanosota-1C. The structure showed that Nanosota-1C binds close to the center of the

133

SARS-CoV-2 RBM (Fig. 2A). When the structures of the RBD/Nanosota-1C complex

134

and the RBD/ACE2 complex were superimposed together, significant clashes occurred

135

between ACE2 and Nanosota-1C (Fig. 2B), suggesting that Nanosota-1C binding to the

136

RBD blocks ACE2 binding to the RBD. Moreover, trimeric SARS-CoV-2 spike protein

137

is present in two different conformations: the RBD stands up in the open conformation

138

but lies down in the closed conformation (22-24). When the structures of the

139

RBD/Nanosota-1C complex and the closed spike were superimposed together, no clash

140

was found between RBD-bound Nanosota-1C and the rest of the spike protein (Fig.

141

S2A). In contrast, severe clashes were identified between RBD-bound ACE2 and the rest

142

of the spike protein in the closed conformation (Fig. S2B). Additionally, neither RBD-

143

bound Nanosota-1C nor RBD-bound ACE2 had clashes with the rest of the spike protein

144

in the open conformation (Fig. S2C, S2D). Thus, Nanosota-1C can access the spike

145

protein in both its open and closed conformations, whereas ACE2 can only access the

146

spike protein in its closed conformation. Overall, our structural data reveal that Nanosota-

147

1C is an ideal RBD-targeting drug that not only blocks virus binding to its receptor, but

148

also accesses its target in the spike protein in different conformations.

149

To corroborate our structural data on the Nanosota-1/ACE2 interactions, we

150

performed binding experiments between Nanosota-1 drugs and SARS-CoV-2 RBD using

151

recombinant ACE2 for comparison. The binding affinity between the nanobodies and the

152

RBD were measured by surface plasmon resonance (Table 1; Fig. S3). Nanosota-1A, -1B,

153

and -1C bound to the RBD with increasing affinity (Kd - from 228 nM to 14 nM),

154

confirming success of the stepwise affinity maturation. Nanosota-1C-Fc had the highest

155

RBD-binding affinity (Kd - 15.7 pM), which was ~3,000 times tighter than the RBD-

156

binding affinity of ACE2. Moreover, compared with ACE2, Nanosota-1C-Fc bound to

157

the RBD with a higher kon and a lower koff, demonstrating significantly faster binding and

158

slower dissociation. Next, we investigated the competitive binding among Nanosota-1C,

159

ACE2, and RBD using protein pull-down assay (Fig. S4A). ACE2 and Nanosota-1C

160

were mixed together in different ratios in solution, with the concentration of ACE2 kept

161

constant; RBD-Fc was added to pull down ACE2 and Nanosota-1C from solution. The

162

result showed that as the concentration of Nanosota-1C increased, less ACE2 was pulled

163

down by the RBD. Thus, ACE2 and Nanosota-1C bound competitively to the RBD. We

164

then analyzed the competitive binding using gel filtration chromatography (Fig. S4B).

165

ACE2, Nanosota-1C, and RBD were mixed, with both ACE2 and Nanosota-1C in molar

166

excess over the RBD. Analysis by gel filtration chromatography documented that no

167

ternary complex of ACE2, Nanosota-1C, and RBD formed; instead, only binary

168

complexes of RBD/ACE2 and RBD/Nanosota-1C were detected. Hence, the bindings of

169

ACE2 and Nanosota-1C to the RBD are mutually exclusive.

170

Nanosota-1C-Fc potently neutralized SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro and in vivo

171

The ability of the Nanosota-1 drugs to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro

172

was investigated nex. Both a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus entry assay and authentic SARS-

173

CoV-2 infection assay were performed (Fig. 3). For the pseudovirus entry assay,

174

retroviruses pseudotyped with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (i.e., SARS-CoV-2

175

pseudoviruses) were used to enter human ACE2-expressing HEK293T cells in the

176

presence of an inhibitor. The efficacy of the inhibitor was expressed as the concentration

177

capable of neutralizing 50% of the entry efficiency (i.e., 50% Neutralizing Dose or

178

ND50). Nanosota-1C-Fc had an ND50 for the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus of 0.27 µg/ml,

179

which was ~10 times more potent than monovalent Nanosota-1C (2.52 µg/ml) and over

180

100 times more potent than ACE2 (44.8 µg/ml) (Fig. 3A). Additionally, Nanosota-1

181

drugs potently neutralized SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus bearing the D614G mutation in the

182

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (Fig. S5), which has become prevalent in many strains (25).

183

For the authentic virus infection assay, live SARS-CoV-2 was used to infect Vero cells in

184

the presence of an inhibitor. Efficacy of the inhibitor was described as the concentration

185

capable of reducing the number of virus plaques by 50% (i.e., ND50). Nanosota-1C-Fc

186

had an ND50 of 0.16 µg/ml, which was ~20 times more potent than monovalent

187

Nanosota-1C (3.23 µg/ml) and ~6000 times more potent than ACE2 (980 µg/ml) (Fig.

188

3B; Fig. S6). Overall, both Nanosota-1C-Fc and Nanosota-1C are potent inhibitors of

189

SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus entry and authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection.

190

After the in vitro studies, we next evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of the lead drug

191

Nanosota-1C-Fc in a hamster model challenged with SARS-CoV-2 via intranasal

192

inoculation. In addition to an untreated control group, three groups of animals were

193

injected with a single dose of Nanosota-1C-Fc: (i) 24 hours pre-challenge at 20 mg/kg

194

body weight, (ii) 4 hours post-challenge at 20 mg/kg, and (iii) 4 hours post-challenge at

195

10 mg/kg. As previously validated in this model (26), body weight, tissue pathology and

196

virus titers in nasal swabs were used as metrics of therapeutic efficacy. In the untreated

197

control group, weight loss was precipitously starting on day 1 post-challenge with the

198

lowest weight recorded on day 6 (Fig. 4A). Nasal virus titers were high on day 1 and

199

remained high on day 5 before a decline (Fig. S7). Pathology analysis on tissues collected

200

on day 10 revealed moderate hyperplasia in the bronchial tubes (i.e., bronchioloalveolar

201

hyperplasia) (Fig. 4B), with little hyperplasia in the lungs. These data are consistent with

202

previous reports showing that SARS-CoV-2 mainly infects the nasal mucosa and

203

bronchial epithelial cells of this hamster model (26). In contrast, hamsters that received

204

Nanosota-1C-Fc 24-hours pre-challenge were protected from SARS-CoV-2, as

205

evidenced by the metrics of no weight loss, no bronchioloalveolar hyperplasia, and

206

significantly reduced nasal virus titers (Fig. 4, Fig. S7). When administered 4 hours post-

207

challenge, Nanosota-1C-Fc also effectively protected hamsters from SARS-CoV-2

208

infections at either dosage (20 or 10 mg/kg), as evidenced by the favorable therapeutic

209

metrics (Fig. 4, Fig. S7). Overall, Nanosota-1C-Fc was effective at combating SARS-

210

CoV-2 infections both preventively and therapeutically.

211

Nanosota-1C-Fc is stable in vitro and in vivo with excellent bioavailability

212

With the lead drug Nanosota-1C-Fc demonstrating therapeutic efficacy in vivo,

213

we characterized other parameters important to its clinical translation. First, we expressed

214

Nanosota-1C-Fc in bacteria for all the experiments carried out in the current study (Fig.

215

5A). After purification on protein A column and gel filtration, the purity of Nanosota-1C-

216

Fc was nearly 100%. With no optimization, the expression yield reached 40 mg/L of

217

bacterial culture. Second, we investigated the in vitro stability of Nanosota-1C-Fc

218

incubated at four temperatures (-80oC, 4oC, 25oC or 37oC) for one week and then

219

measured the remaining SARS-CoV-2 RBD-binding capacity by ELISA (Fig. 5B). With

220

-80oC as a baseline, Nanosota-1C-Fc retained nearly all of its RBD-binding capacity at

221

the temperatures surveyed. Third, we measured the in vivo stability of Nanosota-1C-Fc

222

(Fig. 5C). Nanosota-1C-Fc was injected into mice via tail vein. Sera were obtained at

223

different time points and measured for their SARS-CoV-2 RBD-binding capacity by

224

ELISA. Nanosota-1C-Fc retained most of its RBD-binding capability after 10 days in

225

vivo. Antithetically, Nanosota-1C was stable for only several hours in vivo. (Fig. S8A).

226

Last, we examined the biodistribution of Nanosota-1C-Fc in mice (Fig. 5D). Nanosota-

227

1C-Fc was radiolabeled with zirocinium-89 and injected systemically into mice. Tissues

228

were collected at various time points and biodistribution of Nanosota-1C-Fc was

229

quantified by scintillation counter. After three days, Nanosota-1C-Fc remained at high

230

levels in the blood, lung, heart, kidney, liver and spleen, all of which are targets for

231

SARS-CoV-2 (27); moreover, it remained at low levels in the intestine, muscle and

232

bones. In contrast, Nanosota-1C had poor biodistribution documenting high renal

233

clearance (Fig. S8B). Overall, our findings suggest that Nanosota-1C-Fc is potent SARS-

234

CoV-2 therapeutic with translational values applicable to the world’s vast population.

235

237

Discussion
Nanobody therapeutics derived from camelid antibodies potentially offer a

238

realistic solution to the COVID-19 pandemic compared to conventional antibodies.

239

Currently, there have only been a few reports of nanobody drugs that specifically target

240

SARS-CoV-2 (12, 13). Those reported were developed against SARS-CoV-2 RBD,

241

either blocking out ACE2 or locking the RBD in the closed inactive state on the spike

242

protein (12, 13). None of the nanobodies have been evaluated in animal models for their

243

anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic efficacy. From our novel library, we developed a series of

244

nanobody drugs, named Nanosota-1, that specifically target the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Two

245

rounds of affinity maturation yielded Nanosota-1C which bound to the RBD with high

246

affinity. Addition of an Fc tag to make a bivalent construct with increased molecular

247

weight and picomolar RBD-binding affinity resulted in the best performing drug

248

Nanosota-1C-Fc. Our structural and biochemical data showed that binding of Nanosota-

249

1C to the RBD blocked virus binding to viral receptor ACE2. A unique feature of the

250

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is that it is present in two different conformations, an RBD-

251

up open conformation for receptor binding and an RBD-down closed conformation for

252

immune evasion (20, 22, 23). Due to its small size as well as its ideal binding site on the

253

RBD, Nanosota-1 can bind to the spike protein in both conformations. In contrast, ACE2

254

can only bind to the spike protein in its open conformation. Thus, Nanosota-1 drugs are

255

ideal RBD-targeting therapeutics - they can chase down and inhibit SARS-CoV-2 viral

256

particles whether they are infecting cells or hiding from immune surveillance. As a result

257

of this unique property, both Nanosota-1C and Nanosota-1C-Fc exhibited a profound

258

therapeutic effect in vitro against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and authentic SARS-CoV-2.

259

Nanosota-1C-Fc was also found to be the first anti-SARS-CoV-2 camelid nanobody-

260

based therapeutic reported in the literature to demonstrate efficacy in an animal model.

261

Additionally, Nanosota-1C-Fc was the first anti-SARS-CoV-2 nanobody to have been

262

characterized for ease of production and purification, in vitro and in vivo stabilities, and

biodistribution. These features are critical for the implementation of Nanosota-1C-Fc as a

264

COVID-19 therapeutic.

265

When evaluating the anti-SARS-CoV-2 potency of the nanobody therapeutics, we

266

used recombinant ACE2 as a comparison. Recombinant ACE2 was selected because

267

Nanosota-1 series directly compete with cell-surface ACE2 for the same binding site on

268

the RBD. Our study showed that compared with ACE2, the best performing drug

269

Nanosota-1C-Fc bound to the RBD ~3000 fold more strongly, blocking out ACE2

270

binding to the RBD. Furthermore, compared with ACE2, Nanosota-1C-Fc inhibited

271

SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus entry ~100 fold more effectively and inhibited authentic

272

SARS-CoV-2 infections ~6000 fold more effectively. Note that recombinant ACE2 has

273

been shown to be a potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor (28) and is currently undergoing

274

clinical trials in Europe as an anti-COVID-19 drug. Compared with ACE2, the much

275

higher anti-SARS-CoV-2 potency of Nanosota-1C-Fc was due to both its much higher

276

RBD-binding affinity and its better access to the oft-hidden RBD in the spike protein. As

277

a result, Nanosota-1C-Fc was a potent therapeutic in vivo. Remarkably, a single dose of

278

Nanosota-1C-Fc effectively prevented SARS-CoV-2 infection in hamsters and also

279

effectively treated SARS-CoV-2 infection in the same model. The hamster model is one

280

of the best non-primate models available for studying anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic

281

efficacy, but it is limited by a short virus infection window; hence, repeated dosing was

282

not evaluated. As a result, we were only able to dose the mice once via intraperitoneal

283

injection. Because SARS-CoV-2 is fast acting in hamsters, the time points and dosages

284

for drug administration in hamsters are difficult to directly translate to humans. Our

285

supporting data document that Nanosota-1c-Fc is easy to produce in bacteria and has

286

excellent bioavailability and pharmacokinetics when administered intravenously in mice.

287

This suggests that Nanosota-1C-Fc may have therapeutic potential when administered

288

intraperitoneal, intravenous or even intramuscular. These parameters will need to be

289

determined in future studies in anticipation of clinical trials. Overall, Nanosota-1C-Fc

290

has proven to be an effective therapeutic in the model that we currently have available.

291

How can the novel nanobody therapeutics help to end the COVID-19 pandemic?

292

First, as evidence by our animal study, Nanosota-1C-Fc can be used to prevent SARS-

293

CoV-2 infection. Because of its long in vivo half-life (>10 days), a single injected dose of

294

Nanosota-1C-Fc can theoretically protect a person from SARS-CoV-2 infection for days

295

or weeks in the outpatient setting, reducing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in human

296

populations. Second, we also learned from our in vivo study that Nanosota-1C-Fc can

297

potentially be used to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections, thus, saving lives and alleviating

298

symptoms in infected patients in the clinical setting. Third, though ephemeral in nature

299

given its short half-life and rapid clearance from the blood, Nanosota-1C could be used

300

as an inhaler to treat infections in the respiratory tracts (10) or as an oral drug to treat

301

infections in the intestines (11). Overall, the novel series of Nanosota-1 therapeutics can

302

help minimize the mortality and morbidity of SARS-CoV-2 infections and help restore

303

the economy and daily human activities. Given the wide distribution of SARS-CoV-2 in

304

the world, large quantities of anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics would need to be

305

manufactured to provide for the world’s populations. This is only feasible with easy to

306

produce and scalable molecules, such as Nanosota-1 drugs, that are produced at high

307

yields and have long in vitro and in vivo half-life. Therefore, if further validated in

308

clinical trials, Nanosota-1 therapeutics can provide a realistic and effective solution to

Cell lines, plasmids and virus

334

HEK293T cells (American Type Culture Collection) were cultured in Dulbecco’s

335

modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-

336

glutamine, 100 units/mL penicillin, and 100 µg/mL streptomycin (Life Technologies).

Construction of camelid nanobody phage display library
The camelid nanobody phage display library was constructed as previously

357

described (29, 30). Briefly, total mRNA was isolated from B cells from the spleen, bone

358

marrow and blood of over a dozen non-immunized llamas and alpacas. cDNA was

359

prepared from the mRNA. The cDNA was then used in nested PCR reactions to construct

360

the DNA for the library. The first PCR reaction was to amplify the gene fragments

361

encoding the variable domain of the nanobody. The second PCR reaction (PCR2) was

362

used to add restriction sites (SFI-I), a PelB leader sequence, a His6 tag, and a HA tag. The

363

PCR2 product was digested with SFI-I (New England Biolabs) and then was ligated with

364

SFI-I-digested PADL22c vector. The ligated product was transformed via electroporation

365

into TG1 E. coli (Lucigen). Aliquots of cells were spread onto 2YT agar plates

366

supplemented with ampicillin and glucose, incubated at 30°C overnight, and then scraped

367

into 2YT media. After centrifugation, the cell pellet was suspended into 50% glycerol

368

and stored at -80°C. The library size was 7. 5 × 1010. To display nanobodies on phages,

369

aliquots of the TG1 E. coli bank were inoculated into 2YT media, grown to early

370

logarithmic phase, and infected with M13K07 helper phage.

Camelid nanobody library screening

373

The above camelid nanobody phage display library was used in the bio-panning

374

as previously described (31). Briefly, four rounds of panning were performed to obtain

375

the SARS-CoV-2 RBD-targeting nanobodies with high RBD-binding affinity. The

376

amounts of the RBD antigen used in coating the immune tubes in each round were 75 µg,

377

50 µg, 25 µg, and 10 µg, respectively. The retained phages were eluted using 1 ml 100

378

mM triethylamine and neutralized with 500 µl 1 M Tris-HCl pH 7.5. The eluted phages

379

were amplified in TG1 E. coli and rescued with M13K07 helper phage. The eluted

380

phages from round 4 were used to infect ss320 E. coli. Single colonies were picked into

381

2YT media and nanobody expressions were induced with 1 mM IPTG. The supernatants

382

were subjected to ELISA for selection of strong binders (described below). The strong

383

binders were then expressed and purified (described below) and subjected to SARS-CoV-

384

2 pseudovirus entry assay for selection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 efficacy (described below).

385

The lead nanobody after initial screening was named Nanosota-1A.

386
387
388

Affinity maturation
Affinity maturation of Nanosota-1A was performed as previously described (32).

389

Briefly, mutations were introduced into the whole gene of Nanosota-1A using error-prone

390

PCR. Two rounds of error-prone PCR were performed using the GeneMorph II Random

391

Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent Technologies). The PCR product was cloned into the PADL22c

392

vector and transformed via electroporation into the TG1 E. coli. The library size was 6 x

393

108. Three rounds of bio-panning were performed using 25 ng, 10 ng and 2 ng RBD-Fc,

394

respectively. The strongest binder after affinity maturation was named Nanosota-1B. A

395

second round of affinity maturation was performed in the same way as the first round,

396

except that three rounds of bio-panning were performed using 10 ng, 2 ng and 0.5 ng

397

RBD-Fc, respectively. The strongest binder after the second round of affinity maturation

398

was named Nanosota-1C.

401

Production of Nanosota-1 drugs
Nanosota-1A, 1B and 1C were each purified from the periplasm of ss320 E. coli

402

after the cells were induced by 1 mM IPTG. The cells were collected and re-suspended in

403

15 ml TES buffer (0.2 M Tris pH 8, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5 M sucrose), shaken on ice for 1

404

hour and then incubated with 40 ml TES buffer followed by shaking on ice for another

405

hour. The protein in the supernatant was sequentially purified using a Ni-NTA column

406

and a Superdex200 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) as previously described (20).

407

Nanosota-1C-Fc was purified from the cytoplasm of Shuffle T7 E. coli. The induction of

408

protein expression was the same as above. After induction, the cells were collected, re-

409

suspected in PBS and disrupted using Branson Digital Sonifier (Thermofisher). The

410

protein in the supernatant was sequentially purified on protein A column and

411

Superdex200 gel filtration column as previously described (20).

Production of SARS-CoV-2 RBD and ACE2.

414

HEK293T cells stably expressing SARS-CoV-2 RBD (containing a C-terminal

415

His tag or Fc tag) or human ACE2 ectodomain (containing a C-terminal His tag) were

416

made according to the E and F sections of the pLKO.1 Protocol from Addgene

417

(http://www.addgene.org/protocols/plko/). The proteins were secreted to cell culture

418

media, harvested, and purified on either Ni-NTA column (for His-tagged proteins) or

419

protein A column (for Fc-tagged protein) and then on Superdex200 gel filtration column

420

as previously described (20).

421
422

ELISA

423

ELISA was performed to detect the binding between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and

424

Nanosota-1 drugs (either purified recombinant drugs or drugs in the mouse serum) as

425

previously described (33). Briefly, ELISA plates were coated with recombinant SARS-

426

CoV-2 RBD-His or RBD-Fc, and were then incubated sequentially with nanobody drugs,

427

HRP-conjugated anti-llama antibody (1:5,000) (Sigma) or HRP-conjugated anti-human-

428

Fc antibody (1:5,000) (Jackson ImmunoResearch). ELISA substrate (Invitrogen) was

429

added to the plates, and the reactions were stopped with 1N H2SO4. The absorbance at

430

450 nm (A450) was measured using a Synergy LX Multi-Mode Reader (BioTek).

431
432

Determination of the structure of SARS-CoV-2 RBD complexed with Nanosota-1C

433

To prepare the RBD/Nanosota-1C complex for crystallization, the two proteins

434

were mixed together in solution and purified using a Superdex200 gel filtration column

435

(GE Healthcare). The complex was concentrated to 10 mg/ml in buffer 20 mM Tris pH

436

7.2 and 200 mM NaCl. Crystals were screened at High-Throughput Crystallization

437

Screening Center (Hauptman-Woodward Medical Research Institute) as previously

438

described (34), and were grown in sitting drops at room temperature over wells

439

containing 50 mM MnCl2, 50 mM MES pH 6.0, 20% (W/V) PEG 4000. Crystals were

soaked briefly in 50 mM MnCl2, 50 mM MES pH 6.0, 25% (W/V) PEG 4000 and 30%

441

ethylene glycol before being flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data were

442

collected at the Advanced Photon Source beamline 24-ID-E. The structure was

443

determined by molecular replacement using the structures of SARS-CoV-2 RBD (PDB

444

6M0J) and another nanobody (PDB 6QX4) as the search templates. Structure data and

445

refinement statistics are shown in Table S1.

446
447
448

Surface plasmon resonance assay
Surface plasmon resonance assay using a Biacore S200 system (GE Healthcare)

449

was carried out as previously described (20). Briefly, SARS2-CoV-2 RBD-His was

450

immobilized to a CM5 sensor chip (GE Healthcare). Serial dilutions of purified

451

recombinant Nanosota-1 drugs were injected at different concentrations: 320 nM – 10

452

nM for Nanosota-1A; 80 nM - 2.5 nM for Nanosota-1B and Nanosota-1C; 20 nM - 1.25

453

nM for Nanosota-1C-Fc. The resulting data were fit to a 1:1 binding model using Biacore

454

Evaluation Software (GE Healthcare).

455
456
457

Protein pull-down assay
Protein pull-down assay was performed using Immunoprecipitation kit

458

(Invitrogen) as previously described (20). Briefly, 10 µl protein A beads were incubated

459

with 1 µg SARS-CoV-2 RBD-Fc at room temperature for 1 hour. Then different amounts

460

(7.04, 3.52. 1.76, 0.88, 0.44, 0.22, or 0 µg) of Nanosota-1C (with a C-terminal His tag)

461

and 4 µg human ACE2 (with a C-terminal His tag) were added to the RBD-bound beads.

462

After one-hour incubation at room temperature, the bound proteins were eluted using

elution buffer (0.1 M glycine pH 2.7). The samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE

464

and analyzed through Western blot using an anti-His antibody.

465
466
467

Gel filtration chromatography assay
Gel filtration chromatography assay was performed on a Superdex200 column.

468

500 µg human ACE2, 109 µg Nanosota-1C and 121 µg SARS-CoV-2 RBD were

469

incubated together at room temperature for 30 min. The mixture was subjected to gel

470

filtration chromatography. Samples from each peak off the column were then subjected to

471

SDS-PAGE and analyzed through Coomassie blue staining.

472
473
474

SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus entry assay
The potency of Nanosota-1 drugs in neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus entry

475

was evaluated as previously described (20, 22). Briefly, HEK293T cells were co-

476

transfected with a plasmid carrying an Env-defective, luciferase-expressing HIV-1

477

genome (pNL4-3.luc.R-E-) and pcDNA3.1(+) plasmid encoding SARS-CoV-2 spike

478

protein. Pseudoviruses were collected 72 hours after transfection, incubated with

479

individual drugs at different concentrations at 37°C for one hour, and then were used to

480

enter HEK293T cells expressing human ACE2. After pseudoviruses and target cells were

481

incubated together at 37°C for 6 hours, the medium was changed to fresh medium,

482

followed by incubation of another 60 hours. Cells were then washed with PBS buffer and

483

lysed. Aliquots of cell lysates were transferred to plates, followed by the addition of

484

luciferase substrate. Relative light units (RLUs) were measured using an EnSpire plate

reader (PerkinElmer). The efficacy of the drug was expressed as the concentration

486

capable of neutralizing 50% of the entry efficiency (Neutralizing Dose 50 or ND50).

487
488
489

SARS-CoV-2 plaque reduction neutralization test
The potency of Nanosota-1 drugs in neutralizing authentic SARS-CoV-2

490

infections was evaluated using a SARS-CoV-2 plaque reduction neutralization test

491

(PRNT) assay. Specifically, individual drugs were serially diluted in DMEM and mixed

492

1:1 with 80 pfu SARS-CoV-2 at 37°C for 1 hour. The mixtures were then added into

493

Vero E6 cells at 37°C for an additional 45 minutes. After removing the culture medium,

494

cells were overlaid with 0.6% agarose and cultured for 3 days. Plaques were visualized

495

by 0.1% crystal violet staining. The efficacy of each drug was calculated and expressed

496

as the concentration capable of reducing the number of virus plaques by 50% compared

497

to control serum-exposed virus (i.e., ND50).

SARS-CoV-2 challenge of hamsters

500

Equal sex Syrian hamsters (n=24) were obtained from Envigo (IN) and

501

challenged via intranasal inoculation with SARS-CoV-2 (at a titer of 1 x 106 Median

502

Tissue Culture Infectious Dose or TCID50) in 100 µL DMEM (50 µL per nare). Sample

503

size was comparable to previous animal challenge studies (33) and constrained by the

504

availability of resources. At a sample size of 6 animals per group, G*Power analysis

505

indicates that we can detect an effect size of 1.6 with a power of .80 (alpha = .05 one-

506

tailed). Four groups of hamsters (n=6 each randomly assigned) were treated with

507

Nanosota-1C-Fc via intraperitoneal injection at one of the following time points and

dosages: (1) 24 hours pre-challenge at 20 mg/kg body weight of hamsters; (2) 4 hours

509

post-challenge at 20 mg/kg body weight of hamsters; (3) 4 hours post-challenge at 10

510

mg/kg body weight of hamsters. Hamsters in the control (negative) group were

511

administered PBS buffer 24 hours pre-challenge. An additional group was tested for a

512

different hypothesis and the data were not included in the current study. Body weights

513

were collected daily beginning prior to challenge. Nasal swabs were collected prior to

514

challenge and additionally 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, 5 days and 10 days post-challenge for

515

quantitative real-time RT-PCR (nasal swabs collected on day 2 and day 3 were lost due to

516

Hurricane Laura). Hamsters were humanely euthanized 10 days post-challenge via

517

overexposure to CO2. The lungs and bronchial tubes were collected and fixed in formalin

518

for histopathological analysis. This experiment was performed in accordance with the

519

guidelines set by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of

520

Half-life of Nanosota-1 drugs in mice
Male C57BL/6 mice (3 to 4 weeks old) (Envigo) were intravenously injected (tail-

524

vein) with Nanosota-1C or Nanosota-1C-Fc (100 µg in 100 µl PBS buffer). At varying

525

time points, mice were euthanized and whole blood was collected. Then sera were

526

prepared through centrifugation of the whole blood at 1500xg for 10 min. The sera were

527

then subjected to ELISA for evaluation of their SARS-CoV-2 RBD-binding capability.

To evaluate the in vivo biodistribution of Nanosota-1C-Fc and Nanosota-1C, the

531

nanobodies were labeled with Zirconium-89 [89Zr] and injected into male C57BL/6 mice

532

(5 to 6 weeks old) (Envigo). Briefly, the nanobodies were first conjugated to the

533

bifunctional chelator p-SCN-Bn-Deferoxamine (DFO, Macrocyclic) as previously

534

described (35), and [89Zr] (University of Wisconsin Medical Physics Department) was

535

then conjugated as previously described (36). [89Zr]-labeled nanobodies (1.05 MBq, 1-2

536

µg nanobody, 100 µl PBS) were intravenously injected (tail-vein). Mice were euthanized

537

at different time points. Organs were collected and counted on an automatic gamma-

538

counter (Hidex). The total number of counts per minute (cpm) for each organ or tissue

539

was compared with a standard sample of known activity and mass. Count data were

540

corrected to both background and decay. The percent injected dose per gram (%ID/g) was

541

calculated by normalization to the total amount of activity injected into each mouse.

concentrations. Infection was characterized as the number of virus plaques formed in

669

overlaid cells. Images of virus plaques for each inhibitor at the indicated concentrations

are shown. Each image represents data from triplications. The efficacy of each inhibitor

671

was calculated and expressed as the concentration capable of reducing the number of

Figure S2. The binding of Nanosota-1C to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in different
conformations. (A) The binding of Nanosota-1C to the spike protein in the closed
conformation. The structures of the RBD/Nanosota-1C complex and SARS-CoV-2 spike
protein in the closed conformation (PDB: 6ZWV) were superimposed based on their
common RBD structure (in cyan). Nanosoto-1C is in red. The rest of the spike protein is
in gray. (B) The binding of ACE2 to the spike protein in the closed conformation. The
structures of the RBD/ACE2 complex (PDB 6M0J) and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in
the closed conformation (PDB: 6ZWV) were superimposed based on their common RBD
structure. ACE2 is in green. Clashes between ACE2 and the rest of the spike protein were
circled. (C) The binding of Nanosota-1C to the spike protein in the open conformation
(PDB: 6VSB). (D) The binding of ACE2 to the spike protein in the open conformation
(PDB: 6VSB).

Figure S3. Measurement of the binding affinities between Nanosota-1 drugs and
SARS-CoV-2 RBD by surface plasmon resonance assay using Biacore. Purified
recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RBD was covalently immobilized on a sensor chip through its
amine groups. Purified recombinant nanobodies flowed over the RBD individually at one
of five different concentrations. The resulting data were fit to a 1:1 binding model and the
value of Kd was calculated for each nanobody. The assay was repeated three times
(biological replication: new aliquots of proteins and new sensor chips were used for each
repeat).

Figure S4. Binding interactions between Nanosota-1 drugs and SARS-CoV-2 RBD.
(A) Binding interactions between SARS-CoV-2 RBD, Nanosota-1C, and ACE2 as
evaluated using a protein pull-down assay. Various concentrations of Nanosota-1C and a
constant concentration of ACE2 (all His tagged) were combined in different molar ratios.
SARS-CoV-2 RBD (Fc tagged) was used to pull down Nanosota-1C and ACE2. A
western blot was used to detect the presence of Nanosota-1C and ACE2 following pull
down by SARS-CoV-2 RBD. The assay was repeated three times (biological replication:
new aliquots of proteins were used for each repeat). (B) Binding interactions between
SARS-CoV-2 RBD, Nanosota-1C, and ACE2 as examined using gel filtration
chromatography. Nanosota-1C, ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 RBD (all His tagged) were
mixed together in solution (both Nanosota-1C and ACE2 in molar excess of SARS-CoV2 RBD) and purified using gel filtration chromatography. Protein components in each of
the gel filtration chromatography peaks were analyzed with SDS-PAGE and stained by
Coomassie blue. The assay was repeated three times (biological replication: new aliquots
of proteins were used for each repeat).

Figure S5. Neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus, which contains the D614G
mutation in the spike protein, by Nanosota-1 drugs. The procedure was the same as
described in Fig. 3A, except that the mutant spike protein replaced the wild type spike
protein. The assay was repeated three times (biological replication: new aliquots of
pseudoviruses and cells were used for each repeat).

Figure S6. Detailed data on the neutralization of authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection of
target cells by Nanosota-1 drugs. Data are the mean ± SEM (n = 3). Nonlinear
regression was performed using a log (inhibitor) versus normalized response curve and a
variable slope model (R2 > 0.95 for all curves). The assay was repeated twice (biological
replication: new aliquots of virus particles and cells were used for each repeat).

Figure S7. Additional data on the efficacy of Nanosota-1 drugs in protecting
hamsters from SARS-CoV-2 infections. Nasal swabs were collected from each hamster
on days 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 10. Nasal swab samples from day 2 and day 3 were lost due to
Hurricane Laura. qRT-PCR was performed to determine the virus loads in each of the
samples. The qRT-PCR results are displayed on a log scale (since qRT-PCR amplifies
signals on a log scale). Data are the mean ± SEM (n = 6). Missing data from one animal
in the 4-hour post-challenge (10mg/kg) group on Day 7 were replaced by the average of
that animal’s days 5 and 10 data. ANOVA analysis using group as a between-group
factor and day (1, 5, 7, and 10) as a within-group factor revealed significant differences
between the control group and each of the following groups: 24 hour pre-challenge (20
mg/kg) group (F(1, 10) = 6.02, p = .017, effect size ηp2 = .38), 4 hour post-challenge (20
mg/kg) group (F(1, 10) = 5.38, p = .037, ηp2 = .31), and 4 hour post-challenge (10 mg/kg)
group (F(1, 10) = 3.40, p = .048, ηp2 = .25). All p-values are one-tailed for directional
tests.

Figure S8. Pharmacokinetics of Nanosota-1C. In vivo stability and biodistribution of
Nanosota-1C were measured in the same way as described in Fig. 5C and Fig. 5D,
respectively, except that time points for Nanosota-1C differed from those for Nanosota1C-Fc due to pharmacokinetic differences of the small molecular weight nanobody
versus the larger Fc tagged nanobody.
