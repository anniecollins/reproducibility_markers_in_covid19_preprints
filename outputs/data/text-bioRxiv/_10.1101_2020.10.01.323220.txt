Abstract
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has developed into a global pandemic since its
first outbreak in the winter of 2019. An extensive investigation of SARS-CoV-2 is critical
for disease control. Various recombinant monoclonal antibodies of human origin that
neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infection have been isolated from convalescent patients and will
be applied as therapies and prophylaxis. However, the need for dedicated monoclonal
antibodies in molecular pathology research is not fully addressed. Here, we produced
mouse anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike monoclonal antibodies that exhibit not only robust
performance in immunoassays including western blotting, ELISA, immunofluorescence,
and immunoprecipitation, but also neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 infection in
vitro. Our monoclonal antibodies are of mouse origin, making them compatible with the
experimental immunoassay setups commonly used in basic molecular biology research
laboratories, and large-scale production and easy distribution are guaranteed by
conventional mouse hybridoma technology.

Introduction
The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a threat to global public health and economic
development (Huang et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020). Vaccine and therapeutic discovery
efforts are paramount to restrict the spread of the virus. Passive immunization could have
a major effect on controlling the virus pandemic by providing immediate protection,
complementing the development of prophylactic vaccines (Klasse & Moore, 2020;
Walker & Burton, 2018). Passive immunization against infectious diseases can be traced
back to the late 19th century and the work of Shibasaburo Kitasato and Emil von Behring
on the serotherapy of tetanus and diphtheria. There have been significant developments
in therapies and prophylaxis using antibodies over the past 50 years (Graham &
Ambrosino, 2015).
The advent of hybridoma technology in 1975 provided a reliable source of mouse
monoclonal antibodies (Kohler & Milstein, 1975). With the development of humanized
mouse antibodies and subsequent generation of fully human antibodies by various
techniques, monoclonal antibodies have become widely used in therapy and prophylaxis
for cancer, autoimmune diseases, and viral pathogens (Walker & Burton, 2018). Indeed,
a humanized mouse monoclonal antibody neutralizing respiratory syncytial virus (RSV),
palivizumab, is widely used in clinical settings prophylactically to protect vulnerable
infants (Connor, 1999). In recent years, highly specific and often broadly active
neutralizing monoclonal antibodies have been developed against several viruses (Caskey,
Klein, & Nussenzweig, 2019; Corti et al., 2017; Davide Corti et al., 2016; Corti, Passini,
Lanzavecchia, & Zambon, 2016; Walker & Burton, 2018). Passive immunization with a
monoclonal antibody is currently under consideration as a treatment for COVID-19

caused by SARS-CoV-2 (Dhama et al., 2020; Jawhara, 2020; Jiang, Hillyer, & Du, 2020;
Klasse & Moore, 2020; Ni et al., 2020).
Isolation of multiple human neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against SARSCoV-2 has been reported (Cao et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020; Chi et al., 2020; Hassan et
al., 2020; Ju et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020; Pinto et al., 2020; Robbiani et al., 2020; Rogers
et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2020; Wan et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020; Zeng et
al., 2020; Zost et al., 2020). These antibodies can avoid the potential risks of human-antimouse antibody responses and other side effects (Hansel, Kropshofer, Singer, Mitchell,
& George, 2010). They will be appropriate for direct use in humans since they are
humanized even if these monoclonal antibodies are recombinant. Owing to the recent
rapid development of single-cell cloning technology, the process of antibody isolation has
been dramatically shortened compared with the generation of a conventional monoclonal
antibody secreted from a hybridoma resulting from the fusion of a mouse myeloma with
B cells (Wan et al., 2020). However, since they are recombinant human antibodies
produced in HEK293 cell lines derived from human embryonic kidney, they have a
disadvantage compared to conventional hybridoma-produced antibodies in terms of their
lot-to-lot quality control and manufacturing costs (Cohen, 2020). Instead, monoclonal
antibodies produced by hybridomas are secreted into the culture supernatant, thus their
production is straightforward and of low cost, and their quality is stable. It is also easy to
distribute them to researchers worldwide, although they will not be applicable for
treatment, if not chimeric and humanized, due to their immunogenicity (Hansel et al.,
2010; Reichert, Rosensweig, Faden, & Dewitz, 2005).
In addition to the impact of monoclonal antibodies on therapy and prophylaxis,
they significantly impact the characterization of SARS-CoV-2. To overcome the long-

underlying its lifecycle, including viral entry, genome replication, budding from the
cellular membrane, and interaction with host immune systems. These essential pieces of
information are required for drug discovery, vaccine design, and therapy development.

as

blotting,

and

immunoprecipitation to study the viral life cycle.
Here, we established six monoclonal antibodies against the spike glycoprotein
of SARS-CoV-2. The trimeric spike glycoproteins of SARS-CoV-2 play a pivotal role in
viral entry into human target cells through the same receptor, angiotensin-converting
enzyme 2 (ACE2) as SARS-CoV-1 (Hoffmann et al., 2020). Our antibodies were
produced by a hybridoma resulting from the fusion of a mouse myeloma SP2/0 with
splenocytes obtained from BALB/c mice immunized with purified recombinant spike
proteins. We evaluated these antibodies for application in molecular pathology research.
Among them, two antibodies were shown to attenuate the interaction of spike proteins
with ACE2 and neutralized infection of VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells by SARS-CoV-2. Our
antibodies will accelerate research on SARS-CoV-2 and lead to new therapies and
prophylaxis.

Results
Production of six monoclonal antibodies against spike glycoprotein
The SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein is a homotrimeric fusion protein composed
of two subunits: S1 and S2. During infection, the receptor binding domain (RBD) on S1
subunit binds to ACE2, resulting in destabilization of the spike protein’s metastable
conformation. Once destabilized, the spike protein is cleaved into the N-terminal S1 and
C-terminal S2 subunits by host proteases such as TMPRSS2 and changes conformation
irreversibly from the prefusion to the postfusion state (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Ou et al.,
2020; Song, Gui, Wang, & Xiang, 2018), which triggers an infusion process mediated by
the S2 region (Tai, Zhang, He, Jiang, & Du, 2020; Walls et al., 2020). The instability
needs to be addressed to obtain high-quality spike proteins for downstream applications.
We adopted the design principle reported by Wrapp et al. (Wrapp et al., 2020), in which
the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was engineered to form a stable homotrimer that was
resistant to proteolysis during protein preparation. In our practice, recombinant spike
protein RBD and ectodomain were constructed. A T4 fabritin trimerization motif (foldon)
was incorporated into the C-terminal of the recombinant spike ectodomain to promote
homotrimer formation (Miroshnikov et al., 1998) (Fig. 1A). Recombinant RBD proteins
tagged with GST or MBP were produced using an E. coli expression system (Fig. 1B).
Both recombinant spike protein RBD and ectodomain (S∆TM) were produced using a
mammalian expression system that retained proper protein glycosylation equivalent to
that observed during virus replication (Fig. 1C, S1A). Mice were immunized with these
recombinant spike proteins to generate antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus,
followed by cell fusion to generate a hybridoma-producing antibody. Culture supernatants
were pre-screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), western blotting

(WB), and immunoprecipitation (IP), and six monoclonal hybridomas were isolated and
evaluated.
To characterize these antibodies in detail, they were first purified from the
culture supernatant and examined in terms of ELISA and WB performance. Four
monoclonal antibodies derived from the antigen produced by E. coli (Clones R15, R22,
R31, and R52) and two from mammalian cells (S1D7 and S3D8) showed remarkable
performance. In the ELISA binding assay, all six clones bound glycosylated RBD with
high affinity. When tested against spike glycoprotein (S∆TM), two clones (R15 and R52)
could not be distinguished from non-immune IgG (Fig. 1D). We noted that IgG2 subclass
members tended to have higher binding affinities. Half maximal effective concentration
(EC50) required for these antibodies to bind RBD and S∆TM glycoproteins falls at the
low hundreds ng/mL (Fig. 1E). In WB, where target proteins are reduced and denatured,
all clones established by E. coli produced-antigens performed well at detecting RBD and
S∆TM proteins regardless of glycosylation (Fig. 1F, left, and 1G, S1B). Among them,
clones R15 and R52 showed higher sensitivity in WB. In addition, R52 was capable of
detecting not only artificial spike glycoprotein carrying T4 foldon, but also native spike
glycoprotein expressed in 293T cells on WB (Fig. 1H). However, neither RBD nor S∆TM
could be detected by antibody clones established by the mammalian antigen (S1D7 and
S3D8) on WB, suggesting a strong preference for intact tertiary structure (Fig. 1F, right).

S1D7 and S3D8 antibodies showed higher performance on IP and IF
An antibody capable of recognizing the intact tertiary structure of spike proteins
would contribute to research dissecting the molecular mechanism of SARS-CoV-2
infection, especially cell entry, where these proteins play a significant role. The IP activity

of antibodies can be correlated with the activity of capturing the native structure of the
target protein and neutralizing the infection. We examined the IP performance of our
monoclonal antibodies. Although all clones were capable of immunoprecipitating RBD
and S∆TM glycoproteins, clone R22, R31, S1D7, and S3D8 demonstrated superior IP
efficiency for S∆TM, whereas R22, S1D7, and S3D8 showed higher IP efficiency for
RBD glycoprotein (Fig 2A). As shown in Fig. 2B, our antibodies recognize the spike
protein in a glycosylation-independent manner, and the IP efficiencies of R22, R31, S1D7,
and S3D8, although mild, outperformed others. Noticeably, although clones S1D7 and
S3D8 are not capable of performing WB (Fig. 1F), a strong preference for tertiary
structure grants them remarkable performance in IP, where RBD and S∆TM
glycoproteins were pulled down in their native conformation. Of note, we found that
S1D7 and S3D8 could maintain intact IP efficiency under highly stringent experimental
conditions where sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) was present (Fig S2A).
Next, we examined whether our antibodies could be used in the
immunofluorescence assay (IF). An antibody applicable for IP would also have activity
in IF. Cellular localization of spike proteins is essential for elucidating the mechanism of
packaging and maturation of virions during release from the cellular membrane. We tested
our antibodies' performance in IF using HeLa cells overexpressing trimeric spike protein
with the transmembrane domain. Consistent with their performance in the abovementioned assays (Fig. 2A and 2B), both S1D7 and S3D8 could detect spike proteins
expressed homogeneously on the apical side of HeLa cells with a high signal-to-noise
ratio (Fig. 2C and S2B). However, their localization pattern is different from a previous
report that observed spike proteins exclusively in the Golgi during SARS-CoV-1 infection
(Stertz et al., 2007). One possible reason for the difference could be that the spikes were

expressed with no other viral proteins (see also Fig. 4B). Mouse hepatitis coronavirus
spike protein localizes in the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment
(ERGIC) in a membrane (M) protein dependent manner. In contrast, when expressed by
itself, the spike had a faint reticular appearance (Artika, Dewantari, & Wiyatno, 2020;
Opstelten, Raamsman, Wolfs, Horzinek, & Rottier, 1995).

ACE2-Spike binding inhibition of the monoclonal antibodies
The manner in which antibodies bind and pull down spike glycoproteins in an IP
experiment resembles the process of antibody-mediated neutralization, where spikeACE2 interaction is intercepted by competitive binding between neutralizing antibodies
and spike glycoprotein. The performance of our antibodies in IP experiments prompted
us to examine whether they were capable of inhibiting spike-ACE2 binding or even
neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 infection. First, we performed a spike pull-down assay in
which the spike glycoprotein was pulled down by ACE2 in the presence of monoclonal
antibodies (Fig. 3A and S3A). Clones S1D7 and S3D8 clearly inhibited spike-ACE2
binding, as shown by the dimmed spike signal in WB (Fig. 3B). To quantify the inhibition
ability, we performed a bead-based neutralization assay by measuring the amount of
ACE2 bound to RBD beads after blocking with monoclonal antibodies (Fig. 3C).
Antibodies R22 and R31 showed no disruption of ACE2-RBD interaction, whereas S1D7
and S3D8 showed robust hindrance of ACE2-RBD binding with IC50 values of 248.2
ng/mL and 225.6 ng/mL, respectively (Fig. 3D and 3E). S1D7 and S3D8’s abilities to
inhibit spike-ACE2 binding was consistent with their superior performance in IP
experiments.

S1D7 and S3D8 showed neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2
Next, we asked whether our antibodies inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection in
VeroE6/TMPRSS2 (TM2) cells, which is susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection compared
with the parental VeroE6 cell line by expressing TMPRSS2 (Matsuyama et al., 2020). In
WB, antibodies R52 and R22, but not S1D7 and S3D8, could detect spike glycoprotein
along with the progression of SARS-CoV-2 infection in VeroE6/TM2 cells (Fig. 4A). On
the other hand, S1D7 and S3D8 were applicable to IF in infected VeroE6/TM2 cells.
Spike showed a punctate distribution pattern in the perinuclear region resembling ER and
ERGIC (Sadasivan, Singh, & Sarma, 2017) (Fig. 4B). The subcellular localization of
spike resembled that of the N protein in Vero cells infected with SARS-CoV-1 (Stertz et
al., 2007), suggesting assembly of SARS-CoV-2 virion in the cytoplasm. We then
conducted a live virus neutralization assay to examine whether clones S1D7 and S3D8
inhibit the live virus infection. As expected, although clone R22 failed to protect
VeroE6/TM2 from SARS-CoV-2 infection, S1D7 and S3D8 blocked SARS-CoV-2
infection significantly with IC50 values of 405.2 ng/mL and 139 ng/mL, respectively, even
at relatively high titers of 1500 TCID50 (Fig. 4C, Table 1). A cocktail of S1D7 and S3D8
showed intermediate neutralizing activity (200.1 ng/mL), suggesting that S1D7 and S3D8
share an inhibitory mechanism.

Discussion
Emerging SARS-CoV-2 is a global public health threat to society, which is
predicted to be long-term for several years (Kissler, Tedijanto, Goldstein, Grad, &
Lipsitch, 2020). Although there are multiple ongoing endeavors to develop neutralizing
antibodies, vaccines, and drugs against the virus (Callaway, 2020; Riva et al., 2020), the
lack of adequate, licensed countermeasures underscores the need for a more detailed and
comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis
of the virus (Artika et al., 2020). Fundamental knowledge has significant implications for
developing countermeasures against the virus, including diagnosis, vaccine design, and
drug discovery. Due to the above reasons, and our experiences with routine antibody
productions (Iwasaki et al., 2016; Murano et al., 2019), we have established and
characterized mouse monoclonal antibodies that can be used to dissect the molecular
mechanism of the virus life cycle. These antibodies would serve as a reliable toolset for
basic research investigating the expression profile and subcellular localization of spike
glycoprotein during viral entry, replication, packaging, and budding. These antibodies
could help to identify novel host factors interacting with spike glycoprotein when used in
IP in combination with mass spectrometry. Therefore, advancement in basic research
would accelerate the discovery of drugs targeting virus transmission.
Since passive immunization with neutralizing antibodies has been proposed as a
treatment for COVID-19 (Dhama et al., 2020; Jawhara, 2020; S. Jiang et al., 2020; Klasse
& Moore, 2020; Ni et al., 2020), research interests have largely focused on cloning human
neutralizing antibodies from COVID-19 patients. Our antibodies, S1D7 and S3D8, have
been shown to attenuate the interaction of spike proteins with ACE2 and neutralize
infection of VeroE6/TM2 cells by SARS-CoV-2. It is worth noting that although their

neutralizing activities (IC50 of 405.2 ng/ml and 139 ng/ml) appeared to be lower than
those of human antibodies reported previously (Fig. 4C and Table 1), the stringency of
experimental conditions (relatively high virus titer of 1500 TCID50) tend to underestimate
neutralizing activities of our antibodies compared to other research groups. Specifically,
we used a high multiplicity of live SARS-CoV-2 virus to infect VeroE6/TM2 cells, which
are more prone to virus infection than the commonly adopted VeroE6 cell line. Therefore,
it is difficult to compare antibody efficacy among them (Tse, Meganck, Graham, & Baric,
2020). In addition to in vitro infection, their neutralizing activity in vivo should be
examined in animal models that recapitulate SARS-CoV-2 disease. Our mouse antibodies
will not be applicable for use in clinical treatment, if not chimeric and humanized, due to
their immunogenicity (Hansel et al., 2010; Reichert et al., 2005). On the other hand, they
may be valuable for investigating the mechanism of immune responses to the virus during
passive immunization using mouse models for SARS-CoV-2 infection (Bao et al., 2020;
Dinnon et al., 2020; Hassan et al., 2020; Israelow et al., 2020; R. D. Jiang et al., 2020;
Winkler et al., 2020). They could show stable performance due to lot-to-lot consistency
and act as benchmarks for other antibodies and drug developments.

Materials and Methods
Expression and purification of proteins in human cells
Synthetic DNA sequences encoding SARS-CoV-2 spike protein ectodomain
(S∆TM, residue 1-1208; strain Wuhan-hu-1; GenBank: QHD43416.1) and RBD (residue
319-591; strain Wuhan-hu-1; GenBank: QHD43416.1) fused with an N-terminal signal
peptide, a C-terminal trimerization motif, an HRV3C cleavage site, an SBP purification
tag, and an 8xHis-tag were inserted into pEFx mammalian expression vector. S1/S2 (682RRAR-685) and S2’ (986-KV-987) cleavage sites of spike protein were mutated (682GSAS-685, 986-PP-987, respectively) to prevent protease cleavage. The codon
composition of DNA fragments was optimized and synthesized for protein expression in
human cells (FASMAC). Full-length spike, human ACE2-SBP (residue 1-708;
NP_001358344), and ACE2-FLAG were synthesized and cloned into pcDNA3.4 vector
(Thermo Fisher). Recombinant proteins were prepared by Expi293 Expression System
(Thermo Fisher) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. They were secreted into
culture medium supernatant of the Expi293F cells, and then affinity purified by
Streptavidin Sepharose High Performance (Cytiva). Purification tags were removed by
treating recombinant proteins with HRV3C protease (TaKaRa) and cOmplete™ His-tag
Purification Resin (Roche). Purity and glycosylation of recombinant proteins were
examined by PNGase F (N-Zyme Scientifics) treatment followed by SDS-PAGE and

The DNA sequence encoding SARS-CoV-2 spike protein RBD (residue 410580; strain Wuhan-hu-1; GenBank: QHD43416.1) was amplified from a nasopharyngeal
swab of a patient treated in the Keio University Hospital, and in-framed inserted into
pGEX-5X-1 and pMAL-c2G E. coli expression plasmid, downstream of GST-tag and
MBP-tag encoding sequence respectively. Sample collection is approved by Keio
University Bioethics Committee with the number 20200063. Recombinant proteins were
expressed in overnight 16ºC cultured BL21(DE3)pLysS competent cells transformed by
corresponding vector under induction of 1 mM Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside
(IPTG). MBP-tagged RBD was affinity purified by Amylose Resin (NEB) according to
manufacturer’s instructions; GST-tagged RBD was affinity purified by Glutatione
Sepharose 4B (Cytiva) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Purity of purified
recombinant proteins were examined by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining.

Cell cultures
The mouse myeloma cell line SP2/0-Ag14 (RCB0209) was provided by the
Riken Bioresouces Center (Tsukuba, Japan). The cells were cultured in RPMI 1640
(Nissui) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated calf serum (Biowest) and 1 ng/mL
recombinant human interleukin 6 (IL-6, PeproTech). HeLa and 293T cells were cultured
in DMEM (Nacalai tesque) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Biowest). We maintained
hybridoma clones against spike glycoproteins in Hybridoma Serum-free Medium
(FUJIFILM Wako) supplemented with 1 ng/mL IL-6.

Production of monoclonal antibodies

immunization serving as a booster. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with 100 µL
chyle containing 10-50 µg antigen prepared with TiterMax Gold adjuvant (SigmaAldrich) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Four days after boosting,
splenocytes of immunized mice were collected by grinding the spleens in RPMI 1640
medium. Splenocytes (1×108) were immediately mixed with 5×107 SP2/0 myeloma cells
and fused using an electro cell fusion generator ECFG21 (NepaGene) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. After fusion, cells were cultured in HAT medium (RPMI

aminopterin (Sigma-Aldrich)) for 10 days to select hybridomas. Hybridomas were
subsequently screened by ELISA, in which RBD glycoproteins were generated from the
Expi293F expression system. We performed western blotting and immunoprecipitation
for further screening and subjected to monoclonization by serial dilution. For antibody
production, monoclonal hybridomas were cultured in Hybridoma Serum-Free Medium
(FUJIFILM Wako) supplemented with IL-6. Monoclonal antibodies were purified from
hybridoma culture supernatants using Thiophilic-Superflow Resin (Clontech) or AbCapcher MAG2 (ProteNova) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The isotype of
antibodies was determined using the IsoStrip Mouse Monoclonal Antibody Isotyping Kit
(Roche).

Western blotting and immunoprecipitation
S∆TM and RBD glycoproteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE and transferred
onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Protran, GE Healthcare). Lysates of 293T
cells transfected with plasmids encoding full-length spike glycoproteins was also
separated by SDS-PAGE for WB. The membrane was blocked in 1% nonfat skim milk

and then incubated in 1 µg/mL anti-spike antibodies for 1h at room temperature. After
three times washing in PBS-T (0. 1% Tween-20), the membrane was incubated in 1:5000
dilution of the peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (MP
Biomedicals) for 30 min at room temperature. Signals were detected using ECL Western
Blotting Detection Reagents (GE Healthcare).
For immunoprecipitation assay, 1 µg of purified antibodies was conjugated to 10
µl Dynabeads Protein G (Thermo Fisher) for 30 min at room temperature, followed by
washing twice in IP buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl(pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% NP-40).
Antibody conjugated beads were incubated with 100 ng S∆TM in 50 µl IP buffer for 2
hours at room temperature. Beads were washed three times in IP buffer and eluted with
SDS-PAGE loading dye at 95ºC for 5 min. Immunoprecipitation of S∆TM was examined
by SDS-PAGE followed by western blotting using antibody R52.

Immunofluorescence
Before performing immunofluorescence, HeLa cells seeded on cover glasses
were transfected with plasmids encoding full length SARS-CoV-2 spike protein for 2 days
using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher). Cells were fixed with 2% formaldehyde in
PBS for 10 min at room temperature, washed in PBS-T once, and permeabilized with
0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were blocked by 1%
non-fat skim milk in PBS-T for 10 min, then incubated with 0.5 µg/mL antibody for 1 h
at room temperature. After three times wash in PBS-T, cells were incubated in 1:500
diluted Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Thermo
Fisher) and 1 µg/mL DAPI solution for 30 min at room temperature. The cover glasses
were mounted with Prolong Glass Antifade Mountant (Thermo Fisher) overnight at room

microscope.

ELISA of antibody binding to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein
Nunc MaxiSorp™ flat-bottom 96-well plates (Thermo Fisher) were coated with
170 ng S∆TM in 50 µl PBS overnight at 4ºC, then blocked at room temperature for 1 hour
by applying 200 µl of 3.75% BSA in PBS-T. Monoclonal antibodies starting from 100
µg/mL were four-folds serial diluted with blocking buffer to 12 gradients and incubated
with plates for 1 hour at room temperature, followed by incubation with horseradish
peroxidase (HRP) conjugated sheep anti-mouse secondary antibody (MP Biomedicals)
1:5000 diluted in blocking buffer for 30 min at room temperature. Plates were incubated
for 15 min at room temperature with 1-Step Turbo TMB-ELISA Substrate Solution
(Thermo Fisher), then terminated with equal volume of 1M phosphoric acid. Signal was
quantified by measuring absorbance at 450 nanometer using iMark Microplate
Absorbance Reader (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Half-maximum effective concentration
(EC50) was calculated by non-linear regression analysis of absorbance curve.

ACE2-binding inhibition assay
For spike pull-down assay, S∆TM glycoprotein was incubated with 1 µg antispike antibody in 50 µl binding buffer (PBS supplemented with 0.1% NP-40) at room
temperature for 1 hour, then 3 µg of ACE2-SBP recombinant protein was applied the
reaction for 1 hour. The ACE2-SBP was pull-down by 10µl Dynabeads M-270

with binding buffer and elution with SDS-PAGE loading dye at 95ºC for 5 min. ACE2Spike binding inhibition was examined by SDS-PAGE, followed by WB using antibody
R52.
For bead-based neutralization assay, 20 µl of Streptavidin beads were incubated
with 4 µg of RBD-SBP in 100 µl of TBSTx (TBS supplemented with 1% TritonX-100)
overnight at 4°C with shaking. After washing, beads were incubated with diluted
antibodies for 20 min at 4°C, washed, incubated with 4 µg/mL of ACE2-FLAG for 20
min at 4°C, washed, and incubated with an anti-DYKDDDDK antibody conjugated with
APC fluorophore (MBL) for 20 min at 4°C. After the final wash, the mean fluorescence
intensity (MFI) of beads was analyzed by a FACS Verse (BD). The relative MFI of beads
was calculated by normalization using the MFI of beads incubated with non-immune
mouse IgG.

Virus neutralization assay
SARS-CoV-2 virus (obtained from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases)
was prepared from culture fluids harvested from infected VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells (JCRB
Cell Bank, JCRB1819) (Matsuyama et al., 2020). The virus titer was 3 × 107 TCID50/mL.
The virus solution containing 1500 TCID50 was incubated with each antibody at
concentrations of serial threefold dilutions starting from 5 µg/mL. After incubating at
room temperature for 1 h, the antibody-treated virus solution was mixed with
VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells in glass-bottom 96-well plates. At 7 h post-infection, cells were
fixed in 4% PFA and subjected to indirect immunofluorescence assays using S1D7
antibody as described above. The number of infected cells were imaged and analyzed
using ArrayScan (Thermo Fisher). Mouse anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) was also used
