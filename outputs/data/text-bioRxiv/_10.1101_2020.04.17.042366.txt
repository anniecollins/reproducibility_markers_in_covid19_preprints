There is an ongoing worldwide coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic caused by severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). At present, confirmatory diagnosis is by reverse
transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), typically taking several hours and requiring a molecular
laboratory to perform. There is an urgent need for rapid, simplified and cost-effective detection methods. We
have developed and analytically validated a protocol for direct rapid extraction-free PCR (DIRECT-PCR)
detection of SARS-CoV-2 without the need for nucleic acid purification. As few as 6 RNA copies per reaction
of viral nucleocapsid (N) gene from respiratory samples such as sputum and nasal exudate can be detected
directly using our one-step inhibitor-resistant assay. The performance of this assay was validated on a
commercially available portable PCR thermocycler. Viral lysis, reverse transcription, amplification and
detection are achieved in a single-tube homogeneous reaction within 36 minutes. This minimized hands-on
time, reduces turnaround-time for sample-to-result and obviates the need for RNA purification reagents. It
could enable wider use of Covid-19 testing for diagnosis, screening and research in countries and regions
where laboratory capabilities are limiting.

Introduction
A novel coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) caused
by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) was reported in Wuhan, China in
December 2019 (1). The World Health Organization
(WHO) has declared Covid-19 a pandemic, triggering
various travel restrictions, border control, contact
tracing, quarantine and social distancing measures in
many countries (2). Despite these interventions,
Covid-19 continues to spread, with 2 million cases
reported globally (3), and even in countries with welldeveloped public health systems and aggressive
implementation of measures (4). For instance,
Singapore which reported its first imported case on
23rd Jan 2020 and the first local transmission on 4
February 2020 (5, 6), has seen a ten-fold increase in
cumulative cases in the past 25 days (7).
The first SARS-CoV-2 genome was published and
deposited in NCBI database as Wuhan-Hu-1,
GenBank accession number MN908947 on 14
January 2020 (8). This allowed several laboratories
around the world, including our laboratory, to develop

DIRECT-PCR of SARS-CoV-2

nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) to detect
SARS-CoV-2 genetic materials (9). Currently, there
are many quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) based
NAAT being developed for SARS-CoV-2 (10). These
target various viral genes including the nucleocapsid
(N), polyprotein (ORF1ab), spike (S) and envelope
(E) gene region of the positively stranded 29.9 kb
RNA virus. These tests are widely used to screen
suspected Covid-19 patients, returning travelers from
outbreak areas, close contacts of cases, and healthy
individuals who may be asymptomatic carriers of the
virus (5, 11). Typically, respiratory samples such as
sputum or nasal, throat, nasopharyngeal swabs
collected consecutively over two days are tested to
confirm a diagnosis or to confirm recovery. (5).
Diagnostic testing is recognized as a rate-limiting
step, and there is a global need to ramp up laboratory
capacity, in both well-developed and low-income
countries (4, 12). This is worsened by the possibility
that asymptomatic individuals in the community could
transmit infection, hence increasing the need to
screen healthy individuals or those with mild
symptoms (13-15).

Quantitative RT-PCR is being deployed as primary
method for SARS-CoV-2 detection in research and
hospital laboratories on account of its singlemolecule sensitivity, ease of assay design and
availability of reagents. However, there are several
technical challenges. These tests require RNA
extraction, followed by amplification and detection.
Current state-of-art PCR typically require 70 minutes
for RNA extraction and a further 90 minutes for
amplification (15, 16). Highly trained technical staff,
costly equipment (costing USD 20K - 50K) and
facilities are required. These factors contribute to
longer turnaround-time, costs of manpower, capital
and consumables as well as risks of carryover
contamination and biosafety risks when handling
clinical samples. There is a limited supply of
extraction reagents and test kits worldwide (16, 17).
In addition, asymptomatic individuals have also led to
pre-symptomatic transmission in the community
which further increases demand for laboratory testing
(13). These factors have motivated us to explore
ways to simplify and shorten the protocols, without
significant compromise to the high sensitivity and
specificity of RT-qPCR. We therefore propose a
novel method, which we termed direct rapid
extraction-free PCR (DIRECT-PCR) for Covid-19
diagnosis.
PCR directly from crude samples without nucleic acid
purification has been attempted before using
inhibitor-resistant enzymes, modified buffers and
additives in the mastermix. Our group (Sivalingam et
al, unpublished) and others (18) have previously
detected whole dengue virus in a single tube reaction
containing serum and plasma in up to 8% (v/v). Direct
amplification from samples has also been reported
for the detection of other RNA viruses, including
African Chikungunya virus (19), noroviruses (20),
and bovine viral diarrhea virus (21) and from a variety
of matrices, including serum, throat swab and faeces
(22). However the presence of PCR inhibitors, such
as mucin and proteins, poses a challenge for direct
amplification from respiratory samples (23), and
there are limited studies amplifying coronaviruses
directly from such specimens. We have developed a
DIRECT-PCR protocol using widely used and
validated PCR primers, established its analytical
performance with both DNA and RNA templates in
respiratory samples, and transferred the protocols
from benchtop to a portable thermocycler.

DIRECT-PCR of SARS-CoV-2

Materials and Methods
Samples and controls used for assay
development
For biosafety purposes, synthetic nucleic acids rather
than whole virus templates were used for the
development of this assay. As SARS-CoV-2 is a
positive stranded RNA coronavirus, we synthesized
single stranded RNA (ssRNA) of the amplicon
sequence (99 bp) for SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N)
gene (Integrated DNA Technologies, San Diego).
Plasmid DNA containing the N gene of SARS-CoV2, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV were also used as
positive controls (2019-nCoV RUO Plasmid Controls,
Integrated DNA Technologies, San Diego). ssRNA of
human ribonuclease P (RP) gene amplicon
sequence (65 bp) was synthesized for use as internal
control (Integrated DNA Technologies, San Diego).
Collection and processing of sputum and nasal
exudate samples
Approximately 1 mL of SARS-CoV-2-negative
sputum and nasal exudate from a healthy adult
research team member was collected by hypersaline
inhalation, and used for spike-in of ssRNA and
plasmid controls. Briefly, the respiratory samples
were mixed in 1:1 (v/v) ratio with Sputasol (Oxoid,
England) and vortexed for 5 minutes to remove the
viscosity to allow direct addition to the PCR reaction
mix.
Primer and probes
All primers and probes targeting SARS-CoV-2
ORF1ab and N genes were previously published by
Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention,
Beijing, China (24, 25). The human Ribonuclease P
(RP) gene primer and probe were previously
published by US Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) protocol and was added as an
internal control to detect the presence of human RNA
in the samples (26). All oligonucleotides, primers and
probes were commercially purchased from
Integrated DNA Technologies (San Diego).
RT-qPCR and DIRECT-PCR
Quantitative RT-PCR was initially performed in
monoplex single-tube reaction mixture using two
different separate mastermixes. For standard RTqPCR, PCR master mix containing Invitrogen

(Life Technologies, USA) mastermix, 400 nM of
forward and reverse primers, 200 nM of FAM-based
probe, and 16 U of RNaseOUT™ Recombinant
Ribonuclease Inhibitor (Life Technologies, USA) was
used. For DIRECT-PCR, it was performed using a
PCR enhancer and inhibitor-resistant enzymes
(Direct One-Step S/P RT-qPCR TaqProbe Kit,
VitaNavi Technology LLC, USA), supplemented with
400 nM of forward and reverse primers, 200 nM of
FAM-based probe, and 16 U of RNaseOUT™
Recombinant
Ribonuclease
Inhibitor
(Life
Technologies, USA). 2 μL of ten-fold diluted RNA
template in duplicates was added in a total volume of
20 µL. DNase/RNase-free water was used as the
non-template control (NTC). All reactions were
completed in a 96-well plate format (MicroAmp™
Fast Optical 96-Well Reaction Plate with Barcode,
0.1 mL). The RT-qPCR assays were performed
under the following conditions: reverse transcription
at 50°C for 15 minutes and initial denaturation at
95°C for 1 minute, 45 cycles of denaturation at 95°C
for 10 seconds and annealing at 55°C for 45 seconds
using a standard benchtop real-time thermocycler
(StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System, Applied
Biosystems, USA). A specimen was considered
positive if the amplification curve crossed the
threshold line within 40 quantification cycle (Cq < 40).
DIRECT-PCR of SARS-CoV-2 N gene in sputum
and nasal exudate
All samples used for the spike-in experiments were
freshly prepared. Briefly, 8.5 µL of sputum and nasal
exudates sample mix with Sputasol were aliquoted.
0.5 µL (20 U) of RNaseOUT™ Recombinant
Ribonuclease Inhibitor (Life Technologies, USA) was
added to each aliquot and inverted to mix. Meantime,
the RNA template was ten-fold serially diluted in
DNase/RNase-free water to achieve 8 orders of
magnitude. Next, 1 µL of diluted RNA template was
spiked into the sputum and nasal exudate mix
forming a total volume of 10 µL. Subsequently, 2 μL
of RNA spiked-matrices containing 42.5% sputum
and nasal exudate respectively were directly added
into the 20 µL reaction volume of inhibitor-resistant
PCR reaction mix containing a PCR enhancer and
inhibitor-resistant enzymes (Direct One-Step S/P RTqPCR TaqProbe Kit, VitaNavi Technology LLC,
USA), forward and reverse primers, FAM-based
probe,
and

described above. RNA template in DNase/RNasefree water was used as positive control. A sputum
only and nasal exudate only sample containing
Sputasol were also added as a blank non-template
control (NTC) for the respective matrices. The
reaction mixture was incubated at 50°C for 15
minutes, denatured at 95°C for 1 minute, followed by
45 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 10 seconds and
annealing at 55°C for 45 seconds on a standard
benchtop real-time thermocycler (StepOnePlus RealTime PCR System, Applied Biosystems, USA).
The lowest limit of detection (LoD) was determined
using SARS-CoV-2 N RNA template that was ten-fold
serially diluted in SARS-CoV-2-negative sputum and
nasal exudate samples. LoD was defined as the last
dilution in which quantification cycle (Cq) value could
be detected in all replicates. The linear range
correlation between the theoretical log copy number
calculated from the concentration molarity of
synthetic nucleic acids and Cq value was established
applying a best-fit line to the data by linear regression
analysis. PCR efficiency (E) was calculated from the
slope of the linear equation.
Optimization of Fast DIRECT-PCR assay
The DIRECT-PCR assay was modified in order to
further reduce turnaround time and reagent cost. The
final reaction volume was reduced from 20 µL to 10
µL, while reducing the number of cycles from 45 to
40, reducing reverse transcription (RT) step from 15
minutes to 5 minutes, reducing initial denaturation
from 1 minute to 30 seconds and reducing annealing
duration from 45 seconds to 15 seconds. Ten-fold
serially diluted RNA spike-in matrices described
above were used in duplicates to evaluate the
modified assay to determine a fast protocol for
detection of SARS-CoV-2. Briefly, an aliquot of 1 μL
of template was added in the 10 μL PCR reaction mix
mentioned above. Similarly, the plasmid controls of N
gene from SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV and SARSCoV were ten-fold serially diluted in DNase/RNasefree water to achieve 6 orders of magnitude
respectively. Subsequently, 1 µL of diluted plasmid
template was spiked into the sputum and nasal
exudate mix containing Sputasol and RNaseOUT
forming a total volume of 10 µL as described above.
The internal control using human Ribonuclease P
(RP) gene was evaluated by the DIRECT-PCR of
human RP in the sputum and nasal exudate using the

assay described. Serially diluted human RP RNA
template in water was used as the positive control.
MERS-Cov and SARS-Cov plasmid controls were
added as negative controls. The amplification was
performed on a standard benchtop real-time
thermocycler (StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System,
Applied Biosystems, USA).
The detailed protocol of DIRECT-PCR for SARSCoV-2 is available as Supplementary Information
(Supplementary S1).
Performance of portable real-time thermocycler
DIRECT-PCR assays were validated on the portable
thermocycler (MyGo Mini, IT-IS Life Science Ltd,
Ireland) using the same monoplex single-tube
protocols
described
above.
The
portable
thermocycler is lightweight at less than 2 kg with a
dimension of 12 cm (width) by 12 cm (depth) by 16
cm (height). It can perform up to 16 reactions using
standard 0.1 mL clear qPCR tubes with 10 to 100 µL
reaction volume each. The performance of this
portable qPCR thermocycler was evaluated by
comparing the LoD and amplification efficiency (E) of
DIRECT-PCR assays.
Statistical Analysis
The limit of detection (LoD) was determined by
plotting quantification cycle (Cq) against log10 copy
number concentration. Correlation coefficient (R2)
was calculated by linear regression analysis.
Amplification efficiency (E) was calculated from the
slope of the log-linear curve using the given equation:
E = -1+10(-1/slope). The slopes and intercepts of the
linear regression lines were tested for statistical
significance using Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA)
(GraphPad
Prism
6).
Repeatability

reproducibility of the RT-qPCR assay was

sputum and nasal exudate using this standard
mastermix. Using a PCR inhibitor-resistant
mastermix, the LoD of DIRECT-PCR was determined
to be 120 RNA copies per reaction with a Cq mean
value of 38.48 ± 0.57 at the 7th order of magnitude
(Table 1). The lowest Cq was observed at 17.37 ±
0.04 which corresponded to 1.2 x 108 RNA copies per
reaction (Fig. 1A). The DIRECT-PCR assay was
completed in 72 minutes on the benchtop
thermocycler. The control assay has amplification
efficiency (E) of 84.94% with a correlation coefficient
(R2) of 0.9884 (Fig. 1D). No amplification was
observed for the NTC.
Next, the DIRECT-PCR assay was evaluated using
RNA spiked in sputum and nasal exudate matrices.
The amplification of spiked RNA with PCR inhibition
tolerance was observed with the concentration of
sputum and nasal exudate at 4.25% (v/v) in the PCR
reaction. In RNA spiked sputum samples, the
sensitivity was greater than the control at 12 RNA
copies per reaction with a Cq of 38.79 (Table 1). The
lowest Cq was observed at 16.22 ± 0.24 which
corresponded to 1.2 x 108 RNA copies per reaction
(Fig. 1B). When RNA was spiked in nasal exudate,
we found the LoD of 12 RNA copies per reaction with
a Cq of 38.72 (Table 1). These LoDs were achieved
in one out of two duplicates tested. The lowest Cq in
nasal exudate was observed at 15.18 ± 0.36 which
corresponded to 1.2 x 108 RNA copies per reaction
(Fig. 1C). The PCR efficiency revealed lower
amplification efficiency (E) when spiked into sputum
(82.62%) and nasal exudate (81.27%) compared to
control while the correlation coefficient (R2) at 0.9944
and 0.9986 for sputum and nasal exudate
respectively. The linear regression lines had similar
slopes (p-value = 0.6503) while the intercepts were
significantly different (p-value < 0.0001) (Fig. 1D).

amplification of SARS-CoV-2 N gene ssRNA control (blue line), N gene spiked in sputum (red line) and N
gene spiked in nasal exudate (black line). Templates were ten-fold diluted in 8 orders of magnitude. 2 µL of
template was used in 20 µL of PCR mastermix on the benchtop thermocycler. The amplification efficiency
(E) was determined by plotting of mean Cq values against log10 copy number calculated using theoretical
molarity of templates.
Evaluation of Fast DIRECT-PCR assay
To reduce the duration and cost of the DIRECT-PCR
assay, we modified the total reaction volume to 10 µL
and duration of cycling conditions with the addition of
1 µL template. Amplification of RNA template using
the fast DIRECT-PCR demonstrated detection at 600
RNA copies per reaction (Cq of 39.42) in contrast to
120 RNA copies per reaction (Cq of 38.48 ± 0.57)
detected on the DIRECT-PCR assay. This fast
DIRECT-PCR was completed in 36 minutes as
compared to 72 minutes for the DIRECT-PCR assay.
The LoD was similar at 6 (Cq of 39.28) and 60 RNA
copies per reaction (Cq of 39.34) when spiked into
sputum and nasal exudate samples respectively
(Table 1). Using positive control plasmids encoding
the N gene of SARS-CoV-2, the LoD was found to be
2 copies per reaction (Cq of 39.75) using the
benchtop thermocycler. LoD of 2 and 20 copies per

reaction was observed when the plasmids were
spiked into sputum and nasal exudate samples with
Cq of 38.93 and Cq mean of 38.02 ± 0.55 respectively
over four orders of magnitude (Fig. 2). No
amplification was observed for the negative controls
using MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV plasmids. Human
RP primers were used as an internal control to
amplify and detect the presence of human RNA
present in the crude samples (data not shown). Using
crude sputum and nasal exudate directly, the mean
Cq values for human RP was 26.12 ± 0.24 and 27.76
± 0.81 respectively on the benchtop thermocycler.

Performance of portable thermocycler
A
commercially
available
portable
qPCR
thermocycler was validated by comparing to the
benchtop thermocycler using the fast DIRECT-PCR
assay of RNA and plasmid templates spiked in
sputum and nasal exudate. The amplification
efficiency of RNA control showed that there was no
significant difference (p-value = 0.4344) between
benchtop and portable thermocycler. Both
thermocyclers had similar LoD at 600 RNA copies
per reaction. When using RNA spike-in sputum, the
portable thermocycler had LoD of 600 RNA copies
per reaction (Cq of 36.25 ± 0.46) compared to 6 RNA
copies per reaction when using the benchtop
thermocycler (Table 1). On the other hand, both
thermocyclers had the same LoD of 60 RNA copies
per reaction when using RNA spike-in nasal exudate
(Table 1). Using plasmid controls, there was no
significant difference (p-value = 0.7799) in
amplification efficiency between both thermocyclers
(Fig. 2). Next, using plasmids encoding the N gene of
SARS-CoV-2 as control, the LoD was found to be 2
and 20 copies per reaction when using plasmid
template and plasmid spike-in sputum for benchtop

DIRECT-PCR of SARS-CoV-2

and portable thermocycler respectively. Both
thermocyclers had similar sensitivity of 20 copies per
reaction when using plasmid spike-in nasal exudate
(Table 1). In terms of duration, the reaction took 49
minutes on the portable thermocycler and 36 minutes
on

benchtop

thermocycler.

Discussion
Quantitative RT-PCR of SARS-CoV-2 RNA is
currently the method of choice for the diagnosis of
Covid-19. In our DIRECT-PCR method, we used
inhibitor-resistant enzymes and reagents to eliminate
the RNA extraction step. The use of synthetic RNA
as template obviated the need to handle viral nucleic
acids. With fast DIRECT-PCR protocol, we achieved
further reduction in assay time by optimizing the
thermocycling conditions. We also validated the
analytical performance of DIRECT-PCR on spiked
crude samples and demonstrated its use on a
portable platform.
Current RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2 involves RNA
purification as part of the pre-PCR sample

preparation procedure and at least four to six hours
are needed for time-to-results in most laboratories
(16). When the cycling conditions were optimized in
our fast DIRECT-PCR with small reaction volumes
(10 µL), and shorter RT and annealing durations, we
were able to amplify SARS-CoV-2 in less than an
hour (Fig. 3). Furthermore, there are cost savings on
nucleic acid extraction kits, and the availability of
reagents themselves may be limiting when laboratory
capacity is ramped up and demand is increased
globally. Moreover, DIRECT-PCR is a single-tube
homogeneous reaction that reduces hands-on time
and biosafety risk for laboratory personnel, as well as
the likelihood for carryover contamination. One
caveat however for fast DIRECT-PCR of samples
with low viral load is that of sampling error, since only
1 µL of sample is used. Nucleic acid extractions, on
the other hand, serve to concentrate RNA from
typical sample volumes of 150-300 µL, although their
yield can also be low and variable. Hence, where
samples are expected to have low counts near to the
limit of detection, DIRECT-PCR with larger volume
reactions (25 µL) to include higher template volume
may be necessary to reduce risk of false negatives.

DIRECT-PCR of SARS-CoV-2

Reduction in amplification efficiency is a common
concern in DIRECT-PCR from crude samples (e.g.
respiratory samples, blood and serum). The
presence of PCR inhibitors can decrease the
sensitivity and accuracy of pathogen detection
through interfering with polymerase activity,
degradation of nucleic acids and efficient cell lysis
(23). A variety of methods have been developed to
overcome such inhibition, including inhibitor tolerant
polymerases, additives and buffer modification. In
our study, we used one commercially available
formulation that tolerated PCR inhibition in sputum
and nasal exudates as well as blood/serum/urine
(data not shown), and it is not unlikely that other
formulations could be used as well in our study. While
amplification directly from sputum and nasal exudate
reduced the efficiency of PCR compared to water
controls, there was no net effect on the threshold of
detection.
Nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum have been
suggested to be effective clinical samples for
diagnosis (27, 28), and we have assessed direct
PCR using these matrices. It should be feasible to
extend this to other common samples used for Covid-

19 testing, such as swabs of the throat and
endotracheal tubes, and bronchoalveolar lavage
fluid. While we have focused our DIRECT-PCR
protocols on commonly used primer-probe sets
developed by the China CDC and US CDC that target
the SARS-CoV-2 N gene as well as ORF1ab gene
and the internet control RP (data not shown), we
expect direct PCR to be similarly useful for other viral
primer targets and PCR amplicons developed for
Covid-19 (8, 9), as well as for multiplexed
amplification of several targets in the same tube.
Nevertheless, there may be other inhibitors of PCR
that were not present in our samples that we tested,
and clinical validation with a larger series is needed
to exclude this possibility.
Quantitation of viral nucleic acid in samples by RTqPCR has been used in studies to correlate viral load
with severity, prognosis and transmissibility. The Cq
values in patients’ samples can range from 19 to late
cycles close to 40 during the course of infection. The
nasal viral load has been shown to peak within days
of symptom onset according to small study of throat
and nasal swabs from 17 patients (29). Using RNA
as template, our DIRECT-PCR assay has a dynamic
range of over 7 orders of magnitude with mean Cq
range from 17 to 38, indicating it is reproducibly
quantitative over a wide range, including very high
viral titers. This method could be useful in future
studies, such as to assess viral survivability,
decontamination
methods
and
preventive
intervention.
We have observed, even in spiked water samples,
that amplification efficiencies and the Cq values
obtained at the limit of detection are dependent on
factors such as the reagent mastermix, the model of
thermocycler, the reaction volumes and the cycling
protocols used (Table 1). This variability would be
even more significant in a clinical setting, with the
added confounding factors such as type of sample,
sampling method, dilution in transport buffers,
duration and conditions of storage, and the reagents
and protocols for RNA extraction, that are difficult to
standardize across healthcare settings and
laboratories. While removing the RNA extraction step
could help to reduce this variability in RNA yield and
quality, variability in sample type and sampling
procedure still renders the entire assay nonquantitative. Hence, we caution over-interpretation of

DIRECT-PCR of SARS-CoV-2

Cq values, especially in the absence of in-house
quality control and calibration data for each
combination of protocol, reagents and thermocycler.
These technical factors may also partly explain some
of the false negatives and temporal variability in viral
RNA shedding reported in various studies, that use
fixed criteria Cq < 37 for positive, Cq between 37 to 40
as inconclusive for repeat testing and Cq > 40 as
negative. In fact, our data demonstrates that as viral
RNA concentrations approach the threshold of
detection, our assay LoD has Cq mean value of > 37
and may exceed 40 (Table 1). Since negative
controls in these probe-based assays remain
consistently negative, it should be possible to report
Cq > 37 as positive. Hence to achieve better
standardization of quantitative results, we propose
that instead of reporting Cq, laboratories may report
the equivalent viral copy number in per unit sample
volume, derived from running serial dilutions of viral
or RNA controls in-house.
Our DIRECT-PCR assay has been demonstrated on
a commercially available portable thermocycler that
weighs less than 2 kg, potentially allowing PCR to be
performed outside molecular biology laboratories, in
mobile laboratories, and in low resource settings.
There are many real-time fieldable thermocyclers
available, that are smaller, portable and less costly
than benchtop ones, and three of these we have
evaluated perform similar to benchtop ones (data not
shown). While the optical detection modules and their
fluorescence sensitivity vary between designs, the
overall sensitivity of our assay was similar in both
types of thermocyclers tested (Table 1).
Thermocycling parameters could also be optimized
for rapidity (Fig. 3). As the need to transport samples
to central laboratories could prolong the availability of
test results to beyond 24 hours (16), use of portable
thermocyclers, coupled with appropriate training and
quality control procedures, could allow the use of RTqPCR nearer to the patients and in primary
healthcare settings. Such rapid point-of-care (POC)
tests for use at community level were identified by a
WHO expert group as a key research priority (30). As
the need to transport samples to central laboratories
could prolong the availability of test results to beyond
24 hours (16), use of portable thermocyclers, coupled
with appropriate training and quality control
procedures, could allow the use of RT-qPCR nearer

to the patients and in primary healthcare settings
(12).
Though it is unlikely that DIRECT-PCR would
completely replace conventional RNA extraction with
RT-qPCR in large laboratories as a confirmatory
diagnosis, the trade-off in reliability for portability,
ease of use and cost-effectiveness could be useful
for patient screening and public health surveillance
and in settings with limited laboratory resources and
facilities (4). DIRECT-PCR for Covid-19 could
address the specific requirements and challenges of
delivering molecular genetic testing at the POC
setting. POC diagnostics could play an important role
in the detection, diagnosis and control of this
pandemic (17), such as for more timely diagnosis in
primary healthcare facilities, and to complement realtime fever surveillance and screening. Several
technologies have been proposed and used to
enable molecular testing at POC, including
isothermal amplification methods that do not require
such thermocyclers, like loop-mediated isothermal
amplification (LAMP) (12). However, given the widespread validation of existing SARS-CoV-2 PCR
primer/probe sets, as well as the likely need to modify
amplification primers and probes as the viral
sequences evolve in the future, we argue that
performing PCR using our DIRECT-PCR method is a
more generic and adaptable approach.

Conclusion
Direct amplification of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA from
samples without RNA purification has been
developed, reducing hands-on-time, time-to-results,
and costs. Viral lysis, reverse transcription,
amplification and detection are achieved in a singletube homogeneous reaction taking less than an hour,
and they can be performed on a portable
thermocycler. Analytical validation was performed
with sputum and nasal exudate. The DIRECT-PCR
assay has a high sensitivity of 6 RNA copies per
reaction and is quantitative over a dynamic range of
7 orders of magnitude. This method may be useful
during the current global Covid-19 pandemic in
situations where resources are constrained or where
timely results are needed.
