SUMMARY
The ongoing pandemic caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2) is currently affecting millions of lives worldwide. Large retrospective studies indicate that
an elevated level of inflammatory cytokines and pro-inflammatory factors are associated with
both increased disease severity and mortality. Here, using multidimensional epigenetic,
transcriptional, in vitro and in vivo analyses, we report that Topoisomerase 1 (Top1) inhibition
suppresses lethal inflammation induced by SARS-CoV-2. Therapeutic treatment with two doses
of Topotecan (TPT), a FDA-approved Top1 inhibitor, suppresses infection-induced inflammation
in hamsters. TPT treatment as late as four days post-infection reduces morbidity and rescues
mortality in a transgenic mouse model. These results support the potential of Top1 inhibition as
an effective host-directed therapy against severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. TPT and its derivatives
are inexpensive clinical-grade inhibitors available in most countries. Clinical trials are needed to
evaluate the efficacy of repurposing Top1 inhibitors for COVID-19 in humans.
INTRODUCTION
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
As of 16 November 2020, 54 million people have been infected and 1.33 million have died
[https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html, accessed 16 Nov 2020]. It is currently estimated that
approximately 40-45% of SARS-CoV-2 infections are asymptomatic (Oran and Topol, 2020).
For the remaining patients with symptomatic infections, data from China, Italy and the United
States indicate that approximately 80% of infections are mild (not requiring hospitalization), 15%
are moderate to severe (requiring hospitalization), and 5% are critical (requiring intensive care
unit (ICU) care)(Garg et al., 2020; Livingston and Bucher, 2020; Stokes et al., 2020; Wu and
McGoogan, 2020).
The most common manifestation of severe COVID-19 is acute hypoxemic respiratory failure,
often associated with shock or multi-organ failure (Bhatraju et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020a; Wu
et al., 2020). Shock and multiorgan failure may be related to complications of critical illness; For
example, ventilator-associated lung injury (Slutsky and Ranieri, 2013), secondary infection
(Yang et al., 2020a) and aggravation of underlying chronic organ dysfunction(Cummings et al.,
2020) .
In most countries, the infection fatality rate is around 0.5-1%, and exponentially increases to up
to 10% when referencing more susceptible age groups and people with pre-existing
conditions(O'Driscoll et al., 2020). Therefore, the development of effective treatment plans for
severe COVID-19 is imperative.
SARS-CoV-2 displays similar pathogenic mechanisms to that of SARS-CoV-1
(Channappanavar and Perlman, 2017; Zhu et al., 2020). The main hallmarks of disease
progression feature two phases: a first phase of increasing viremia, followed by a subsequent
steep increase in systemic inflammation (Lee et al., 2020; Merad and Martin, 2020; Siddiqi and
Mehra, 2020). In fact, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-Cov-2 patients who require intensive care
showed elevated plasma levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemo-attractants (Chen et al.,
2020; Del Valle et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020; Lucas et al., 2020; Qin et al., 2020; Wang et al.,
2020b; Yang et al., 2020b; Zhou et al., 2020a)
Several studies have shown that levels of inflammatory molecules can help distinguish those
that survive COVID-19 from those that do not. For example, increased levels of IL-6, fibrin

degradation products (D-dimer), as well as other single measurements like CRP or combinedmeasurement parameters (SOFA score) have been correlated with risk for death from COVID19. (Zhou et al., 2020a). Notably, all non-survivors experienced sepsis (Zhou et al., 2020a).
Therefore, increased systemic inflammation, occurring during disease progression, provides a
biological rationale for interrupting hyper-inflammation to reduce disease severity. Guided by
this logic, clinical trials have begun to examine the efficacy of cytokine blockers and antiinflammatory molecules as potential COVID-19 therapeutics (Merad and Martin, 2020).
However, inhibition of single cytokines such as IL-6 or GM-CSF might not be sufficient (Hermine
et al., 2020; Salvarani et al., 2020). This is due to the fact that many signaling molecules and
pathways are involved in triggering an inflammatory response. Additionally, levels of individual
cytokines can vary depending on the age and the clinical history of the patient, thus limiting the
scope of therapeutics that only target a single inflammatory molecule.
A rapid induction of gene expression serves as a fundamental mechanism in activating an
inflammation response. Inhibition of this process might hold the key to the development of novel
therapeutics for COVID-19. Previously, we have reported that chromatin factors play key roles
in controlling the induction of inflammatory gene expression programs (Marazzi et al., 2012;
Miller et al., 2015; Nicodeme et al., 2010). Targeting the activity of these proteins acting on the
chromatin template, where infection-induced gene transcription is executed, leads to the
concerted suppression of multiple antiviral and anti-inflammatory genes (Marazzi et al., 2012;
Miller et al., 2015; Nicodeme et al., 2010). Such simultaneous inhibition of many virus-induced
genes “in one go” can have a clear advantage over conventional single target therapies
(Marazzi et al., 2018). In particular, we have previously shown that the host enzyme
topoisomerase 1 (Top-1) is required to selectively activate the expression of inflammatory genes
during viral and bacterial infection and co-infections (Rialdi et al., 2016). Therapeutic
administration (after infection) of one to three doses of topoisomerase inhibitors can rescue
mortality in four animal models of inflammation-induced death (Rialdi et al., 2016). These data
support the hypothesis that host-directed epigenetic therapy can be valuable to suppress hyperinflammatory responses in the context of infectious diseases. We present here, a series of
experiments in which we tested the hypothesis that epigenetic therapy aimed at modifying the
host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection would ameliorate severe COVID-19.
RESULTS
Cell signaling cascades converge on chromatin to dictate changes in gene expression programs
upon cell intrinsic and extrinsic signals. We performed a combined structural and epigenetic
analysis during infection in an effort to understand how SARS-CoV-2 alters chromatin function
and the epigenetic landscape of cells upon infection,
To characterize structural chromatin changes we performed Hi-C, a technique that profiles the
three-dimensional architecture of the genome (Bonev and Cavalli, 2016; Hildebrand and
Dekker, 2020). Hi-C was performed on uninfected and SARS-CoV-2 infected A549 cells
expressing the human SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor Ace2 (A549-ACE2) at both early (8 hours)
and late (24 hours) time points post infection, in order to investigate the dynamics of infection
induced changes on chromatin structure. Reproducible results were achieved across replicates
for all time points. (Table S1). Our analysis indicates that large portions of the genome alter
their global interaction profiles as infection progresses, culminating in a major redistribution of
chromatin associated with either the active (A) or inactive (B) compartments at the 24h time
point (Figure 1A). Notably, compartment changes result in a shortening of the domain size, with
large linear stretches of A and B compartment chromatin generally becoming subdivided into

smaller A/B domains (Figure 1A and 1B), a feature that partially phenocopies the loss of
regional topological constraints controlled by cohesin (Rao et al., 2017; Schwarzer et al., 2017).
To characterize whether the structural changes seen using Hi-C were associated with
epigenetic features of gene activation and repression, we performed ChIP-sequencing for
H3K27 acetylation (K27ac), an epigenetic mark found at active regulatory regions that is
commonly used to monitor dynamic changes in transcriptional activation. ChIP-seq for H3K27ac
was performed in uninfected and infected A549-ACE2 cells at the same time points as the Hi-C.
Our analysis showed high correlation of K27ac levels between replicates (Figure S1A). While
some regions of the genome showed no change in K27ac levels upon infection (cluster i; Figure
S1B and S1C), there were statistically significant changes in K27ac levels at promoters and
other regulatory regions during the course of infection (clusters ii to vii; Figure S1B and S1C;
Table S2A-S2C). Regions that significantly gain (clusters v and vi; Figure S1B) and lose K27ac
(clusters ii and iii; Figure S1B) over the course of infection were detected.
We labelled changes in K27ac across condition as “K27 loss” to describe instances in which
reduction of K27ac signal across the genome occurs during infection compared to the
uninfected condition. Increased genomic level of K27ac during infection was labelled as “K27
gain”.
Overlaying the changes in K27ac with structural chromatin changes indicate that regions
gaining or losing K27ac are enriched in chromatin domains that move from B-A or A-B
compartment, respectively (Figure 1C). This partitioning occurs dynamically throughout the
infection (Figure 1C -compare 8h vs 24h) and is associated with gene expression activity
(Figure 1D). These results suggest that the dynamic restructuring of genome
compartmentalization by SARS-CoV-2 infection is highly associated with transcriptional activity.
To characterize whether a unique set of transcription factors might participate in partitioning
chromatin into active or inactive regions during infection, we performed DNA binding site motif
enrichment analysis of regions displaying differential H3K27ac activity. Our results indicate that
repressed regions lack unique enrichment of immune-specific transcription factors at promoters,
enhancers, and other putative regulatory regions (Figure S1D, Table S3). Regions that gain
K27ac signal are largely devoid of unique transcription factor signatures apart from a strong
enrichment for motifs recognized by NF-kB (red bars, cluster v and vi; Figure S1D, Table S3), a
master regulator of inflammatory gene programs.
Overall, our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 induces global epigenetic and structural changes
in the infected cell, underlying the identity of inducible regulatory networks controlling cell
responses to infection.
Topoisomerase I controls SARS-CoV-2-induced gene expression response
To determine whether chromatin factors can control the induction of the cell response by
promoting the transactivation of SARS-CoV-2-induced gene program, we focused our attention
on topoisomerase I (Top1), a factor known to activate bacterial- and viral infection- induced
genes (Rialdi et al., 2016). We performed siRNA-mediated knockdown of Top1 (siTOP1) along
with control siRNA (siSCR) in A549-ACE2 cells, followed by mock treatment (PBS only;
uninfected controls) or infection with SARS-CoV-2. Gene expression changes in these cells
were quantified by RNA-sequencing at 24 hours post infection. Our analyses indicate that
siTOP1 treated cells had a distinct transcriptional response to the virus (Figure 2A) as
compared to no siRNA or siSCR treated cells, and that depletion of Top1 resulted in selective
suppression of many infection-induced genes (Fold Change > 1.5, padj<0.05; Figure 2B and

2C, Table S4). Gene ontology pathway analyses of genes that are downregulated upon Top1
knockdown suggest that many of these genes are involved in inflammatory responses (Figure
2C, Table S5). We further validated our results by qPCR for representative genes IL-6, CXCL8
and TOP1 (Figure 2D), verifying that depletion of Top1 reduces the expression of these
inflammatory genes.
To understand the specificity of Top1, we profiled infection induced and Top1 dependent genes
(“Dep.”; Table S4C) identified in Figure 2B with respect to their structural and epigenetic status
at basal state and after infection. As controls, we used all expressed genes (“Exp”; Table S4C)
or genes that are also induced by infection but unaffected by Top1 depletion (Top1
independent, “Indep.”; Table S4C). Our analysis indicates that genes that depend on Top1 for
their upregulation are induced to higher levels then Top1 independent genes upon infection
(Figure 2E). Top1 dependent genes also displayed greater shifts towards active chromatin
compartment (positive delta PC1 levels, Figure 2F) and increases in K27ac signals (positive
delta H3K27ac levels; Figure 2G) compared to Top1 independent genes. Differences were
more pronounced later in infection (Figures 2F and 2G).
Overall our analysis indicates that Top1-dependent genes are highly inducible during SARSCoV-2 infection as a result of chromatin and epigenetic changes that render their transactivation
permissible.
Top1 inhibition suppresses lung inflammation and lung damage in infected hamsters.
To determine whether inhibition of Top1 activity can dampen inflammatory gene expression in
vivo, we selected topotecan (TPT), a FDA approved Top1 inhibitor, to use in the Syrian Golden
hamster model (Munoz-Fontela et al., 2020) (hereafter referred as hamster) of SARS-CoV-2
infection.
We treated SARS-CoV-2 infected hamsters with either vehicle control (DMSO) or 10mg/kg TPT
at days 1 and 2 post-infection. Lungs from these animals were then collected for histology and
transcriptome analysis at days 4 and 6 post-infection (Figure 3A).
Clustering of RNA-seq reads using principal component analysis (PCA) indicates that the gene
expression profiles under the three conditions (uninfected, infected-DMSO treated, and infectedTPT treated) partition based on infection, treatment status, and the temporality of the infection
(day 4 and 6), with each replicate clustering in close proximity to its counterpart (Figure 3B).
Differential expression (DE) analysis showed that TPT suppresses inflammatory gene
expression in the lungs of infected hamsters (Figure 3C and 3D). Clustering of the DE data
indicates that the gene expression profiles of TPT-treated infected lungs are more similar to that
of the non-infected lungs, rather than infected ones (Figure 3C). The GO categories associated
with the TPT-suppressed genes indicates specific inhibition of virus-induced and inflammatory
genes at both day 4 and day 6 post-infection (Figure 3D).
Histopathological analysis of infected, DMSO vehicle-treated hamster lungs at days 4 and 6
post-infection displayed diffused alveoli destruction, bronchiolar epithelium cell death and
hemorrhaging, coupled with massive immune cell infiltration and exudation, typically associated
with increased expression of inflammatory mediators and recruitment of immune cells during
infection (Figure 3E and 3F). On the contrary, TPT treatment diminished pathological features
of lung damage in infected animals. Lungs from these animals did not have conspicuous

To determine the clinical significance of our observations, we then asked if the genes that were
downregulated by TPT treatment in SARS-CoV-2 infected hamsters also corresponded to
immunopathological gene signatures that have been observed in COVID-19 patients. Crosscomparison of our results with the gene expression profiles in human lungs isolated from
autopsies of COVID-19 patients and uninfected control lungs (Nienhold et al., 2020) indicated
that TPT suppressed genes that are hyperactivated in patients who succumbed to infection
(Figure 4A and 4B). In fact, TPT-inhibited genes are up-regulated in COVID-19 lung autopsy
tissue relative to healthy control (P<1E-3) (Figure 4A, left panel), while genes up-regulated by
TPT are down-regulated in COVID-19 lung relative to control (P<1E-7) (Figure 4A, right
panel). These results suggest that treatment with TPT might reverse COVID-19-induced lung
gene expression responses. The gene expression profiles of TPT inhibited genes in individual
patients (heatmap, Figure 4B) and the corresponding gene set enrichment scores are shown in
Figure 4B.

We next sought to validate whether lower dosages of TPT, which are associated with negligible
cytostatic effects (Guichard et al., 2001; Houghton et al., 1995; Nemati et al., 2010), were
effective in suppressing SARS-CoV-2 infection induced inflammation. We performed a parallel
experiment to the one described in Figure 4A using 5-fold lower TPT (2mg/kg) and the same
regimen of TPT treatment at Day 1 and 2 post-infection (Figure S2A). Lungs from infected and
treated hamsters were assayed at Day 4 post infection.
Animals treated with TPT had reduced lung to body weight ratios post infection (Figure S2B),
which suggest reduced pulmonary edemas in these animals. In line with this, histopathological
analyses showed reduced broncho-pneumonia (Figure S2C-S2E) and immune cell infiltration
(Table S6) in the lungs of TPT treated animals when compared to DMSO treated ones. qPCR
analysis of representative genes also suggested reduced expression of inflammatory genes in
TPT treated animals (Figure S2F). Overall, these results suggest that lower doses of TPT
treatment can still effectively suppress the expression of inflammatory molecules, and
ameliorate inflammation induced pathology during SARS-CoV-2 infection.
In sum, our results support the hypothesis that TPT suppresses SARS-CoV-2-induced lung
inflammation in vivo.
Top1 inhibition therapy suppresses, SARS-CoV-2 morbidity and lethality in transgenic
mice.
To further verify our results, we extended our studies to a complementary model and evaluated
the effects of TPT treatment in transgenic mice that express the human angiotensin I-converting
enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor under the cytokeratin 18 gene promoter (K18-hACE2). This mouse
strain is susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and displays a disease progression profile that
shares many features of severe COVID-19 (Winkler et al., 2020). Importantly, loss of pulmonary
function and weight loss in these mice occurs after the peak of viral replication, and coincides
with infiltration of immune cells (monocytes, T cells, neutrophils) in the lung and alveolar
spaces at day 4 post infection (Winkler et al., 2020). As such, K18-hACE2 have been suggested
as a model to define the basis of SARS-CoV-2-induced lung disease and test immune and
antiviral countermeasures (Bao et al., 2020; Winkler et al., 2020).

To test whether inhibition of inflammation provides a protective effect in infected K18-hACE2
mice, we performed three different regimes of TPT treatments, labelled as early, intermediate,
and late, to respectively describe dosing of the inhibitor at 2mg/kg on days 1+2, days 3+4; or
days 4+5 post-infection respectively (Figure 5A).
The rationale behind this approach is that inhibition of inflammation could be detrimental during
the early phases of the infection, as it might cause increased viral replication and dissemination.
The optimal protective effect of inhibiting inflammation should be achieved during the hyperinflammatory phase of the disease, which would coincide with the later stage of infection.
Indeed, our results showed that early treatment of TPT is ineffective in reducing the morbidity
and mortality caused by SARS-2 infection (Figure 5B and 5C: TPT: D1+D2). Intermediate
treatment ameliorates morbidity but not mortality (Figure 5B and 5C: TPT: D3+D4). Strikingly,
late TPT treatment suppresses both morbidity and mortality (Figure 5B and 5C: TPT: D4+D5).
TPT treatment is associated with suppression of inflammatory gene expression in the lung, as
indicated by qPCR of representative genes IL-6, CXCL3 and CCR8 (Figure 5D).
Our results indicate that inhibition of hyper-inflammation by therapeutic administration of TPT
can rescue K18-hACE2 mice from lethal SARS-CoV-2 infection.
DISCUSSION
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 is currently affecting millions of lives
worldwide, and poses an overwhelming burden on global health systems as well as the
economy. The development of novel therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 remains a top priority.
While prophylactic measures are being evaluated and distributed, drugs available to target
SARS-CoV-2 and function therapeutically are direly needed especially for severe cases of
COVID-19.
Although the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been fully characterized, it has been
observed that SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers hyper- activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines
(IL-6, -Il1b, TNFa) and chemokines (CXCL8, 9, 10, CCL2) (Huang et al., 2020; Lucas et al.,
2020; Merad and Martin, 2020; Tang et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020a). The increased level of
inflammatory molecules has been shown to correlate with COVID-19 disease severity (Del Valle
et al., 2020; Moore and June, 2020). While the exact mechanism and cell type-specific
contributions to hyper-inflammation still needs to be fully elucidated, monocytes, macrophages
and dendritic cells are primary candidates and have been reported to contribute to the cytokinemediated immunopathology seen in human (Del Valle et al., 2020; Giamarellos-Bourboulis et
al., 2020; Moore and June, 2020). This is supported by previous studies of the immune
response against SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV infections (Cheung et al., 2005; Wong et al.,
2004). Additionally, non-myeloid cells have been recently shown to contribute to the hyperinflammatory program (Zhou et al., 2020b). Elevated inflammatory response contributes to
sepsis and multi-organ failure, an important contributor to death from COVID-19 (Zhou et al.,
2020a). Therefore, treatments that can suppress host inflammatory response might be
potentially effective therapeutic strategies for COVID-19. In this light, it is important to highlight
that glucocorticosteroids (dexamethasone, methylprednisolone, hydrocortisone), which act as
suppressors of systemic inflammation, have been reported to ameliorate the outcome of
COVID-19, especially in hospitalized patients who require supplemental oxygen (Group et al.,
2020).

Structural and functional changes in the genome upon infection
While our knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis is expanding rapidly, little is known about
how epigenetic modifications and genome structure are affected by infection, and in what
capacity they affect gene activity (Liu et al., 2020). Our data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection
imposes a pervasive effect on the host cell response at the genome organization level, causing
drastic changes in both the segmentation and interaction patterns of chromatin regions. The
SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced chromatin segregation pattern mirrors what observed in cells
depleted of cohesin, a protein that maintains chromosomal architecture (Hnisz et al., 2016;
Schwarzer et al., 2017). In both SARS-CoV-2 infection and absence of cohesin, large stretches
of A and B compartments become subdivided into smaller A/B domains, leading to reduction in
compartment domain size. These effects are likely indicative of increased chromatin fiber
flexibility, allowing it to segregate more easily according to the activity of the embedded
regulatory elements. Future work is needed to understand the implications of this events for
infection response.
Regarding SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced compartment movement, we surmise that A-to-B and
B-to-A switches are driven by transcriptional and epigenome activity. While A-B transitions are
characterized by decreased K27ac at promoters and gene suppression, B-A is accompanied by
increased K27ac at promoters and gene induction. Gene suppression has functional
consequences as it affects many conventional infection-induced genes activated by STAT1/2
and IRF3 transcription factors. Suppression is likely a result of viral antagonism. In fact, a
recent report elucidates the pleiotropy of viral antagonism mechanisms and their collective
effects on suppressing host functions at transcriptional, co-transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels (Banerjee et al., 2020; Lei et al., 2020). Gene activation is the result of
signal-induced transactivation, and indicates that many cellular genes escape viral suppression
during infection. One prominent example is a subset of inflammatory genes whose expression is
driven by infection-activated transcription factor NF-kB. The proteins encoded by these genes
are potent pro-inflammatory molecules and present systemically with high levels in severe
COVID-19 patients (Del Valle et al., 2020; Moore and June, 2020). The selective and concerted
induction of inflammatory genes provides the rationale for using epigenetic inhibitors to
suppress their induction and establish a global anti-inflammatory state (Marazzi et al., 2018).
Top1 inhibition therapy
We show that the host enzyme Topoisomerase-1 promotes transcriptional activation of proinflammatory genes during SARS-CoV-2 infection. We then demonstrate that Top1 inhibition
limits the expression of inflammatory genes in the lungs of infected animals. Most importantly,
Top1 inhibition decreases morbidity and morbidity in infected mice. The therapeutic effect can
be achieved by drug administration 4-5 days following infection.
Whether the suppression of inflammation in vivo is solely the result of dampened epithelial
response, or whether it affects, directly or indirectly neutrophil/monocytic activation or immune
cell recruitment to the lung remains unknown. We posit that TPT action in both epithelial and
immune cells responses result in the positive outcomes, as TPT is likely to suppress inducible
transcriptional programs in both the infected cells and by-stander cells. Dampening highly
inducible genes and sparing housekeeper genes is a typical feature of epigenetic inhibitors that
act on signal-induced genes, which aside from the requirement of cofactors for their activation
have unifying genomic features like high burst rates conferred by many regulatory
enhancers(Chen et al., 2019; Fukaya et al., 2016; Marazzi et al., 2018; Senecal et al., 2014;
Zabidi et al., 2015).

In sum, TPT and other Top1 inhibitors like irinotecan are widely available and FDA-approved.
Some are in the WHO list of Essential Medicines. They are inexpensive and generic formulation
exists throughout the world, making them easily accessible for immediate use. Overall, our
results suggest that repurposing of TOP1 inhibitor could be a valuable strategy to ameliorate or
treat severe COVID-19.
Pharmacokinetics considerations and limitations of this study
Although the preclinical animal models of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis used here are, as with
any animal model, only partially representative of the biology of humans, our study indicates a
promising effect of TPT by suppressing inflammation in COVID-19. Several factors require
careful consideration prior to extrapolating these results towards the design of clinical trials of
Top1-inhibition therapy for human COVID-19. First, in our animal models, we can suppress
inflammation and reduce disease pathology in the lung using 2 doses of Top1 inhibition therapy
with TPT at 2mg/kg intraperitoneally. This equates to a 5-fold reduction from typical
chemotherapeutic anti-cancer doses in rodent models (Guichard et al., 2001; Houghton et al.,
1995; Nemati et al., 2010). In clinical practice, the Top1 inhibitors TPT and Irinotecan have wellcharacterized pharmacokinetics and toxicity profiles (Kollmannsberger et al., 1999; Mathijssen
et al., 2001), albeit in patients without SARS-CoV-2 infection. Doses that are 5-fold lower than
those used in the treatment of small-cell lung cancer (TPT)(Rowinsky et al., 1992; von Pawel et
al., 1999) and colorectal cancer (irinotecan)(Andre et al., 1999) are expected to cause little to no
toxicity, and importantly no risk of neutropenia. This significant dose reduction, together with the
wealth of clinical experience in the use of TPT and irinotecan should reassure us about potential
concerns over cytotoxicity. Nonetheless, safety trials of the reduced dosage of TPT or irinotecan
in COVID-19 patients will need to be performed prior to testing efficacy. Another important
consideration is that the window of opportunity for Top1 inhibitor treatment in humans needs to
be carefully evaluated. Many reports indicate that the timing of the intervention against
Coronaviruses is key, as protective anti-viral and damaging excessive inflammatory responses
need to be balanced (Channappanavar et al., 2016; Channappanavar et al., 2019; GrajalesReyes and Colonna, 2020). Our data aligns with those studies, as early treatment of TPT did
not display protective effect in mice. In essence, limiting inflammatory response too early during
infection might increase viral replication and dissemination. As TPT-mediated inhibition of
inflammation could theoretically lead to a resurge in viral replication, clinical trials will ideally
need to incorporate the administration of an anti-viral agent with activity against SARS-CoV-2
after TPT treatment. The safety and efficacy of our strategy will now be evaluated in two clinical
trials of TPT that have been submitted for trial initiation, and are set to begin in January 2021
(A.J, D.K., and I.M. -personal communication). Lastly, we strongly discourage any ‘off label’ use
of Top-1 inhibitors until safety and effectiveness is established by clinical trials.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Cells
Human alveolar basal epithelial carcinoma cells (A549, ATCC CCL-185) and monkey kidney
epithelial cells (Vero E6, ATCC CRL-1586) were maintained at 37°C and 5% CO2 and cultured
in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM; Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS; Gibco).
Viral strains
For infections in A549-ACE2 cells and K18-hACE2 mice, SARS-related coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2), isolate USA-WA1/2020 (NR-52281) was used (Blanco-Melo et al., 2020; Daniloski et
al., 2020). For Infections with hamsters in Figure 3, isolate HKG/13_P2/2020 (MT835140) was
used. For Infections with hamsters in Figure S2, isolate USA-WA1/2020 (NR-52281) was used.
SARS-CoV-2 was grown in Vero E6 cells in DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS, 4.5 g/L Dglucose, 4 mM L-glutamine, 10 mM non-essential amino acids, 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 10
mM HEPES. Plaque assays were used to determine infectious titers of SARS-CoV-2 by
infection of Vero E6 cells in Minimum Essential Media supplemented with 2% FBS, 4 mM Lglutamine, 0.2% BSA, 10 mM HEPES and 0.12% NaHCO3 and 0.7% agar.
METHOD DETAILS
Generation of A549-ACE2 Cells
Generation of A549-ACE2 cells was performed as previously described (Blanco-Melo et al.,
2020; Daniloski et al., 2020). Briefly, A549 cells were transduced with lentiviral vector pHR-PGK
expressing human ACE2 coding sequence. A549 cells were then transduced with the lentivirus
in the presence of polybrene (8 μg/ml). Cells were used for downstream assays after 48h post
transduction.
Preparation of siTOP1 sequencing libraries
7.5E4 A549-ACE2 cells were plated in a 24 well dishes. 16 hours post plating, cells were
transfected with control, scrambled (siSCR), Top1-targeting (siTOP1) or no siRNA (no siRNA)
using Lipofectamine RNAiMax to a final concentration of 50nM. 48hours post transfection, the
media was replaced, and fresh media was added to each well. Cells were then mock infected
(PBS only) or infected with SARS-CoV-2 at MOI 0.5. 24 hours post infection, media was
removed, and cells were lysed in 250ul of Trizol reagent (Thermo Scientific). RNA was then
extracted using the Purelink RNA Minikit (Invitrogen) with DNAseI treatment, according to the
manufacturer’s recommendations. RNA quality was determined using the RNA 6000 Nano kit
and the Eukaryote Total RNA Nano assay on the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer System. RNA
quantity was determined by Qubit™ RNA HS Assay Kit.

To then prepare RNA-sequencing libraries, 300 ng of RNA was depleted of ribosomal RNA
using NEBNext® rRNA Depletion Kit (Human/Mouse/Rat), according to the manusfacturer’s
instructions. Libraries were then prepared from rRNA depleted RNA using the NEBNext®
Ultra™ II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina®, following the manufacturer’s
instructions. Final libraries were quantified and sizing was determined using the High Sensitivity
DNA Assay reagents and chip in the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer System and the Qubit 1X dsDNA
HS Assay Kit respectively. Individual libraries were then pooled and sequenced using 75bp
paired end on the NextSeq 550 using the NextSeq 500/550 High Output Kit
ChIP-Seq Library preparation
To prepare ChIP-Sequencing libraries, ~2E5 A549-ACE2 cells were plated into 12 well dishes.
Cells were either mock infected (PBS only) or infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus at MOI 0.5. 24
hours post infection, media was removed from the well, and replaced with Fixation buffer (PBS,
2% FBS, 1% Methanol-Free Formaldehye). Cells were fixed at room temperature for 10 min. 2M
Glycine was then added to a final concentration of 0.125M, and cells were incubated at room
temperature for 5min to quench the reaction. Supernatants were removed from wells, and each
well was washed 3 times with cold PBS. Cells were then lysed in the well using 250ul of SDS
Lysis Buffer [100mM NaCl, 50mM Tris pH8.0, 5mM EDTA, 0.02% NaN3, 0.5% SDS + 1X Halt
Protease and Phosphatase Inhibitor (Thermo Scientific)] and cell lysates were collected in a
1.5ml tube and snap frozen at -80oC. On the day of sonication, lysates were thawed, and diluted
with 125ul of Triton Dilution Buffer [100mM Tris pH8.5, 100mM NaCl, 5mM EDTA, 0.02% NaN3,
5% TritonX-100 + 1X Halt Protease and Phosphatase Inhibitor]. Lysates were then sonicated for
5 - 30 sec ON/ 30 sec OFF cycles twice using the Bioruptor Pico. Each sonicated lysate was
then pre-cleared using 10ul of Rabbit-IgG Dynabeads for 1 hour, rotating at 4oC. 1ug of antiH3K27ac antibody was then added to 300ul of pre-cleared lysate. Immunoprecipitation (IP) was
performed with overnight rotation at 4oC. To recover IP-complexes, 10ul of Dynabeads M-280
Sheep anti-Rabbit IgG were added to each reaction and tubes were rotated for 2 hours at 4oC.
Bead-chromatin complexes were then washed 6 times on a magnet using ice cold RIPA wash
buffer [50mM Hepes-KOH pH7.6, 100mM LiCl, 1mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, 0.5% NaDeoxycholate]. Washed beads were then incubated in 125ul Elution buffer [1% SDS, 0.1M
NaHCO3] at 65oC overnight for elution and de-crosslinking. ChIP DNA was then purified using
the MinElute PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and quantified using the Qubit 1X dsDNA HS Assay
Kit.
ChIP libraries were prepared using the NEBNext® Ultra™ II DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina
following the manufacturer’s recommendations. 1ng of ChIP-DNA was used to prepare each
library. ChIP input libraries were prepared by pooling equal amounts of purified sonicated and
non-IPed DNA from each sample. 1ng of the pooled ChIP-input DNA was used for library
preparation. Libraries were quantified and sizing was determined using the High Sensitivity DNA
Assay reagents and chip in the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer System and the Qubit 1X dsDNA HS
Assay Kit respectively. Individual libraries were then pooled and sequenced 75bp paired end on
the NextSeq 550 using the NextSeq 500/550 High Output Kit v2.5.
Preparation of HiC libraries
In situ Hi-C was performed as described (Heinz 2018) with modifications. The day before
infection, 200k A549-ACE2 cells were plated in a 12 well dishes. Cells were either mockinfected (PBS only) or infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus at MOI 0.5. Twenty-four hours post
infection, media was removed from the well, and replaced with Fixation buffer (PBS, 2% FBS,
1% Methanol-Free Formaldehyde). Cells were fixed at room temperature for 10 min. 2M Glycine
was then added to a final concentration of 0.125M, and cells were incubated at room
temperature for 5min to quench the reaction. Supernatants were then removed wells, and each

well was washed 2 times with cold PBS. Cells were then lysed in the well using 250 µl of Lysis
Buffer [0.5% SDS + Halt Protease and Phosphatase Inhibitors (Thermo Scientific)]. Cell lysates
were collected in a 1.5ml tube. 1.5 mU RNAseA (Thermo Scientific) was added to each lysate,
and lysates were then incubated at 37oC for 1h. RNAseA treated lysates were then snap frozen
and stored in -80°C. After thawing, nuclei were collected at 1500 g for 5 minutes at room
temperature. Most of the supernatant was discarded, leaving the nuclei in 10 µl liquid. Samples
were resuspended in reaction buffer (25 µl 10% Triton X-100, 25 µl 10x Dpn II buffer, 188 µl
water) and rotated at 37°C, 8 RPM for 15 minutes. Chromatin was digested overnight (ON) with
either 2 µl (100 U) Dpn II (NEB) (later experiments) at 37°C, rotating overhead with 8 RPM.
Nuclei were collected by centrifugation at 1500 g for 5 minutes at room temperature, 225 µl of
the supernatant were discarded, leaving the nuclei in 25 µl liquid, and overhangs were filled in
with Biotin-14-dATP by adding 75 µl Klenow Master Mix (54.45 µl water, 7.5 µl NEBuffer 2, 0.35
µl 10 mM dCTP, 0.35 µl 10 mM dTTP, 0.35 µl 10 mM dGTP, 7.5 µl 0.4 mM Biotin-14-dATP
(Invitrogen), 2 µl 10% Triton X-100, 2.5 µl (12.5 U) Klenow fragment (Enzymatics)) and rotating
overhead at RT, 8 RPM for 40 minutes. Reactions were stopped by adding 2.5 µl 0.5 M EDTA
and placed on ice. Proximity ligation was performed by transferring the entire reaction into 1.5
ml Eppendorf tubes containing 400 µl ligase mix (322.5 µl water, 40 µl 10x T4 DNA ligase buffer
(Enzymatics), 36 µl 10% Triton X-100, 0.5 µl 10 % BSA, 1 µl (600 U) T4 DNA ligase (HC,
Enzymatics) and rotating ON at 16°C, 8 RPM. Reactions were stopped with 20 µl 0.5 M EDTA,
treated with 1 µl 10 mg/ml DNase-free RNAse A for 15 minutes at 42°C, then 31 µl 5 M NaCl,
29 µl 10 % SDS and 5 µl 20 mg/ml DNase-free proteinase K (Thermo) were added, proteins
digested for 1 h at 55°C while shaking at 800 RPM, then crosslinks reversed ON at 65°C. After
extraction with 600 µl pH 8-buffered phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (Ambion) followed by
extraction with 600 µl chloroform, DNA was precipitated with 1.5 µl (22.5 µg) Glycoblue
(Ambion) and 1400 µl 100% ethanol ON at -20°C. After centrifugation for 20’ at 16000g, 4°C,
the DNA pellet was washed twice with 80% ethanol, and the pellet air-dried and dissolved in
131 µl TT (0.05% Tween 20/Tris pH 8). DNA (200 ng) was sheared to 300 bp in 130 µl TT on a
Covaris E220 sonicator using the manufacturer’s protocol. Biotinylated DNA was captured on
Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin T1 (Thermo) by combining the sonicated DNA sample (130 µl)
with 20 µl Dynabeads that had previously been washed with 1x B&W buffer (2X B&W: 10 mM
Tris-HCl pH=7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 2 M NaCl) and had been resuspended in 130 µl 2x B&W
containing 0.2% Tween 20. The binding reaction was rotated at RT for 45 minutes, and DNAbound beads were vigorously washed twice with 150 µl 1x B&W/0.1% Triton-X 100, once with
180 µl TET (0.05% Tween 20, 10 mM Tris pH 8, 1 mM EDTA). Libraries were prepared onbeads using an NEBnext Ultra II DNA library prep kit using half the reagent/reaction volumes
given in NEB’s instruction manual and 1.6 pmol Bioo DNA sequencing adapters (Illumina
TruSeq-compatible) per reaction. Reactions were stopped by adding 5 µl 0.5 M EDTA, beads
collected on a magnet and washed twice with 150 µl 1x B&W/0.1% Triton-X 100, twice with 180
µl TET and resuspended in 20 µl TT (0.05% Tween 20, 10 mM Tris pH 8.0). Libraries were
amplified by PCR for 10 cycles (98°C, 30s; 10x [98°C, 10s; 63°C, 20s; 72°C, 30s]; 72°C, 2 min;
4°C, ∞), using 10 µl of the bead suspension in a 50 µl reaction with NEBNext Ultra II Q5 2x
master mix (NEB) and 0.5 µM each Solexa 1GA/1GB primers (Solexa 1GA:
AATGATACGGCGACCACCGA, Solexa 1GB: CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGA). Libraries
were precipitated onto magnetic beads by adding 40 µl 20% PEG8000/2.5 M NaCl and 2 µl
SpeedBeads (8.9 % PEG final) to 48 µl PCR reaction, thorough mixing by vortexing followed by
10-minute incubation at RT. Beads were collected using a magnet and the supernatant
discarded. After washing beads twice by adding 180 µl 80% EtOH, moving the tube strip 6x
from side to side of the magnet, collecting beads and discarding the supernatant, beads were
air-dried, and DNA eluted by adding 20 µl TT. Libraries were sequenced paired-end for 42
cycles each to a depth of approximately 250 million reads per experiment on an Illumina
NextSeq 500 sequencer.

Preparation of Hamster RNA sequencing libraries
For RNA sequencing analyses in infected hamsters shown in Figure 3, infected hamsters that
were treated with TPT or vehicle control, were euthanized at days 4 and 6 post infection.
Uninfected hamsters were used as controls. After euthanasia, lung left inferior lobe from
hamsters were cut into pieces and lysed with RA1 lysis buffer provided with the
NucleoSpin® RNA Plus kit (Macherey-nagel), RNA extraction was performed according the
manufacturer’s recommendations, including an on-column genomic DNA digestion step. RNA
sequencing library preparation and sequencing were then performed by BGI Genomics
Hamster Infections
For experiments shown in Figure 3, Female Golden Syrian hamster, aged 6-8 week old (~70100g), were obtained from Laboratory Animal Unit, University of Hong Kong (HKU). All
experiments were performed in a Biosafety Level-3 animal facility, LKS Facility of Medicine,
HKU. The study has been approved by the Committee on the Use of Live Animals in Teaching
and Research, HKU. Virus stock was diluted with Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to 2 x 104
PFU/ml. Hamsters were anesthetized with ketamine (150mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/mg) and
then intranasally inoculation with 50 ul of diluted viruses containing 103 PFU of viruses. For drug
treatments, 10mg/kg TPT resuspended in vehicle [5% DMSO + 5% corn oil in PBS] or vehicle
alone was administered intraperitoneally to animals on the indicated days post infection.
For experiments shown in Figure S2, infection procedures were performed following protocols
approved by the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee (IACUC). Animal studies were carried out in strict accordance with the
recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National
Research Council. 7-10 week old (~120-140g) female Golden Syrian hamsters (Charles River)
were anesthetized using 90mg/kg Ketamine and 2mg/kg Xylazine by intraperitoneal injection.
Once anesthetized, hamsters were intransally infected with 1E5 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 virus resuspended in 100ul of PBS. Animals were monitored daily for clinical signs of illness and weight
loss after infection. For drug treatments, 2mg/kg TPT resuspended in vehicle [4.5% DMSO +
20% Sulfobutylether-β-Cyclodextrin (SBE-β-CD) in PBS] or vehicle alone was administered
intraperitoneally to animals on the indicated days post infection.
K18-hACE2 mice infections
All mice infection procedures were performed following protocols approved by the Icahn School
of Medicine at Mount Sinai Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Animal
studies were carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the
Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Research Council. 5-10 week old female
B6.Cg-Tg(K18-ACE2)2Prlmn/J (K18-hACE2) mice purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar
Harbor, ME) were anesthetized by an intraperitoneal injection of 90mg/kg Ketamine and 2
mg/kg xylazine. Once anesthetized, mice were infected with 1E4 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 virus
suspended in 30ul of PBS. Mice were monitored daily for clinical signs of illness and weight loss
after infection. Animals that reached 75% bodyweight or clinical signs that are irrevocably linked
with death were humanely euthanized by intraperitoneal injection of 60mg/kg pentobarbital.
For drug treatments, 2mg/kg Topotecan-hydrochloride (TPT; 14129, Cayman Chemical
Company) re-suspended in vehicle [4.5% DMSO + 20% Sulfobutylether-β-Cyclodextrin (SBE-βCD) in PBS] was administered intraperitoneally to animals on the indicated days post infection.

Upon euthanasia, the superior lobe of infected hACE2-KI mice or Golden Syrian hamsters were
collected for RNA extraction. Lungs were lysed and homogenized in Trizol. RNA extraction was
performed using the Purelink RNA Mini Kit with a DNAseI treatment step, according to the
manufacturer’s recommendations. cDNA was synthesized from RNA using the High-Capacity
cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (ThermoFisher).
Histological analysis
For histological slides shown in Figure 3E to 3H, Lung left superior lobes of infected Golden
Syrian hamster were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde and then processed for paraffin
embedding. The 4µm tissue sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin for
histopathological examination. Images were with Olympus BX53 semi-motorized fluorescence
microscope using cellSens imaging software.
For histological slides shown in Figure S2D and S2E, the left lung lobe of infected Golden
Syrian hamsters was fixed in 10% formalin for 48 hours. Embedding in paraffin blocks and
staining with H&E were conducted by the Biorepository and Pathology Dean’s CoRE at the the
Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Microscopic sections were analyzed in a blinded
fashion by the same pathologist (A.M.). A number was randomly assigned by the investigator to
discriminate each section, which was then submitted for analysis. No information about
treatments and mouse genotypes was communicated to the pathologist. Lungs were scored by
the area involved in broncho-pneumonia.

QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSES
Mouse Infection Studies
Mice were randomly assigned into treatment groups. Statistical significance between survival
curves was calculated using a Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test using Graphpad Prism 8.0 software.
Two tailed Student’s t-tests under the assumption of equal variances between groups were
used to compare weight loss in mice from different groups for each day post infection. Data are
shown as +-SEM.
Quantitative qPCR assays
qPCR assays were done with 3-4 biological replicates (3-4 infected animals/condition).
Statistical significance in gene expression was estimated with Graphpad Prism 8.0 software,
and determined using two-tailed Student’s t test under the assumption of equal variances
between groups. Data are shown as +/- SEM
Illumina Short Read RNA sequencing analyses
After adaptor removal with cutadapt (Martin, 2011) and base-quality trimming to remove 3′read
sequences if more than 20 bases with Q <20 were present, paired-end reads were mapped to
the SARS-CoV-2 and human (hg38) or hamster (Mesocricetus auratus; MesAur1.0) reference
genomes with STAR . Gene-count summaries were generated with featureCounts (Liao et al.,
2014). A numeric matrix of raw read counts was generated, with genes in rows and samples in
columns, and used for differential gene expression analysis with the Bioconductor Limma
package (Ritchie et al., 2015) after removing genes with less than 50 total reads across all
samples or of less than 200 nucleotides in length. Normalization factors were computed on the
filtered data matrix using the weighted trimmed mean of M-values (TMM) method, followed by
voom (Law et al., 2014) mean-variance transformation in preparation for Limma linear modeling.
To specifically identify the effect of siRNA mediated Top1 depletion on the inflammatory
responses to SARS-CoV-2 in A549-ACE2 cells shown in Figure 2, we used interaction model
(siTOP1_Infected:siTOP_uninfected
siSCR_Infected:siSCR_uninfected
or
no_siRNA_infected:no_siRNA:uninfected - siSCR_Infected:siSCR_uninfected), that takes into

account basal differences between conditions. To identify TPT dependent gene expression
changes in infected hamsters showin in Figure 3, we performed pairwise contrast between
experimental groups (i.e: TPT D4 – DMSO D4; TPT D6 – DMSO D6). Pairwise comparisons
were then performed between treatment groups and eBayes adjusted P-values were corrected
for multiple testing using the Benjamin-Hochberg (BH) method and used to select genes with
significant expression differences (fold change > 1.5, adjusted P value <0.05).
GSEA analysis for gene signatures in TPT treated hamsters
We identified Top1 inhibitor gene signatures from TPT-treated Syrian hamsters infected with
SARS-CoV-2. We defined the up- and down-regulated signatures as genes differentially
expressed after 4 or 6 days of treatment (log2|FC| > 1, FDR=10%). We converted hamster
genes to available human orthologs using ENSEMBL (Release 101). We downloaded
normalized transcript expression from targeted RNA-seq (398 genes) on lung autopsy tissue
from COVID19 patients (16 patients, 34 samples), normal lung tissue (6 patients, 17 samples),
and lung tissue from from bacterial or viral pneumonia (4 patients, 5 samples) [(Nienhold et al.,
2020), GEO accession: GSE151764]. Gene set enrichment analysis (Subramanian et al., 2005)
was performed using the R package fgsea (Korotkevich et al., 2019). We used Tukey's multiple
comparison test to identify significant differences in mean normalized enrichment scores.
ChIP-seq analysis
ChIP-seq datasets were processed and analyzed using an in-house automated pipeline
(https://github.com/MarioPujato/NextGenAligner). Briefly, basic quality control for raw
sequencing
reads
was
performed
using
FASTQC
(version
0.11.2)
(http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc). Adapter sequences were removed
using
Trim
Galore
(version
0.4.2)
(https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/), a wrapper script that
runs cutadapt (version 1.9.1) to remove the detected adapter sequence from the reads. The
quality controlled reads were aligned to the reference human genome (hg19/GRCh37) using
bowtie2 (version 2.3.4.1)(Langmead and Salzberg, 2012). Aligned reads were then sorted using
samtools (version 1.8)(Li et al., 2009) and duplicate reads were removed using picard (version
1.89) (https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/). Peaks were called using MACS2 (version 2.1.0)
(https://github.com/taoliu/MACS)(Zhang et al., 2008) with the control/input aligned reads as
background (callpeak -g hs -q 0.01 –broad -c input/control). ENCODE blacklist regions
(Amemiya et al., 2019) were removed using the hg19-blacklist.v2.bed.gz file available at
https://github.com/Boyle-Lab/Blacklist/tree/master/lists.
The ChIP-seq experimental design consisted of triplicates experiments for each condition (0hr,
8hr, 24hr infections). PCA analysis indicating strong agreement between experimental
replicates and clear separation between conditions (Figure S1A) Sequencing reads from
replicates were thus combined, and alignment and peak calling was again performed as
described above. For differential peak analysis, the union set of all peaks from these three
conditions was generated using bedtools (Quinlan and Hall, 2010). For each of the resulting
genomic regions, read counts were obtained for all 9 replicates. These read counts used as
input to DESeq2 (Love et al., 2014). A fold change cutoff of greater than or equal to 1.5 and an
FDR-corrected p-value cutoff of less than or equal to 0.05 were used to identify differential
peaks for each pairwise comparison between conditions.
We used the HOMER suite of tools (Heinz et al., 2010), modified to use a log base two scoring
system and to include the large set of human motifs contained in the CisBP database (build
2.0)(Lambert et al., 2019) to identify enriched motifs within the sequences of differential and
shared ChIP-seq peaks. To minimize redundancy, motifs were grouped into classes using the

following procedure. Each human transcription factor was assigned the single best p-value
obtained for any of its corresponding motifs. Transcription factors with identical best motifs
were merged then into a single class.
HiC analysis
Hi-C data was processed as described in (Heinz et al., 2018). Briefly, Hi-C reads were trimmed
at MboI/DpnII recognition sites (GATC) and aligned to the human genome (GRCh38/hg38)
using STAR (Dobin et al., 2013), keeping only read pairs that both map to unique genomic
locations for further analysis (MAPQ > 10). All PCR duplicates were also removed. PCA
analysis of Hi-C experiments used to define chromatin compartments were performed with
HOMER(Lin et al., 2012). For each chromosome, a balanced and distance normalized contact
matrix was generated using window size of 50 kb sampled every 25 kb, reporting the ratios of
observed to expected contact frequencies for any two regions. The correlation coefficient of the
interaction profiles for any two regions across the entire chromosome were then calculated to
generate a correlation matrix (also visualized in Figure 1A). This matrix was then analyzed
using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) from the prcomp function in R (https://www.rproject.org), and the eigenvector loadings for each 25 kb region along the first principal
component were assigned to each region (PC1 values). The PC1 values from each
chromosome were scaled by their standard deviation to make them more comparable across
chromosomes and analysis parameters. For each chromosome, PC1 values are multiplied by
−1 if negative PC1 regions are more strongly enriched for active chromatin regions defined by
H3K27ac peaks to ensure the positive PC1 values align with the A/permissive compartment (as
opposed to the B/inert compartment). chrY was excluded from the PCA analysis due to its small
size and high repeat content. Balanced, normalized Hi-C contact maps were generated at 25 kb
resolution for visualization (Figure 1A). Assignment of PC1 values to Gencode gene promoters
and other features was performed using HOMER’s annotatePeaks.pl function using the results
from the PCA analysis.

inflammatory damages. Arrows: Bronchiolar epithelium cells death with milder peribrochiolar
infiltration; Arrowheads: Diffuse alveolar wall thickening with capillary congestion. No
conspicuous alveolar space infiltration, exudation or hemorrhages; Open arrows: Vasculitis is
very mild and rare
(H) Representative scan of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained sections of the lungs of
infected hamsters that have been treated with TPT 6 days post infection. Patchy lung tissue

Figure 4: TPT suppresses gene programs upregulated in autopsy-lung from COVID19
patients.
(A) Gene set enrichment analysis of lung-tissue gene expression profiles from COVID19
deceased patients versus healthy patients (Nienhold et al., 2020). Signed –log10 adjusted P
values indicate enrichment of down-regulated (top panel) and up-regulated (bottom panel) gene
signatures from TPT-treated hamsters infected with SARS-CoV-2. The sign of enrichment is
given by the normalized enrichment score (NES). Dashed lines indicate a significance levels of
P=0.05. Differences in mean NES are shown: * P = 10-3, ** P = 5x10-4, *** P = 10-7.
(B) Expression in lung autopsy tissue of COVID19 patients and healthy controls [(Nienhold et
al., 2020), GSE151764] of genes down-regulated in TPT-treated Sars-CoV-2-infected hamsters
(log2|FC| > 1, FDR=10%). Patient groups are indicated by the topmost bar, where healthy
controls are colored in cyan, and COVID-19 patients colored in red. Gene set enrichment
scores, calculated as −log10(P)*sign(NES) are indicated in the middle bar. The sign of
enrichment is given by the normalized enrichment score (NES). Positive, higher scores (orange)
indicate that TPT-inhibited genes are more upregulated in a given patient, whereas negative,
lower scores (green) indicate that TPT-inhibited genes are more downregulated in a given
patient. The lower heatmap shows the individual gene expression profile of the indicated TPTinhibited gene for a given patient (in columns). Heatmap is sorted by column from the highest
(left) to lowest enrichment score (right).
