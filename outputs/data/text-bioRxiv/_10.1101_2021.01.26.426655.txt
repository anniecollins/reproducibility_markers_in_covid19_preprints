ABSTRACT
Introduction:
Indonesia kick-started the big project of COVID-19 vaccination program in January 2021 by
employed vaccine to the president of Indonesia. The outbreak and rapid transmission of
COVID-19 have endangered the global health and economy. This study aimed to investigate
the full-length genome mutation analysis of 166 Indonesian SARS-CoV-2 isolates as 12
January 2021.
Methods:
All data of isolates was extracted from the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data
(GISAID) EpiCoV database. CoVsurver was employed to investigate the full-length genome
mutation analysis of all isolates. Furthermore, this study also focused on the unlocking of
mutation in Indonesian SARS-CoV-2 isolates S protein. WIV04 isolate that was originated
from Wuhan, China was used as a virus reference according to CoVsurver default. All data
was visualized using GraphPad Prism software, PyMOL, and BioRender.
Results:
This study result showed that a full-length genome mutation analysis of 166 Indonesian
SARS-CoV-2 isolates was successfully discovered. Every single mutation in S protein was
described and then visualised by employing BioRender. Furthermore, it also found that
D614G mutation appeared in 103 Indonesian SARS-CoV-2 isolates.
Conclusion:
To sum up, this study helps to observe the spread of the COVID-19 transmission. However, it
would like to propose that the epidemiological surveillance and genomics studies might be
improved on COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia.

INTRODUCTION
SARS-CoV-2 firstly occurred in China and then transmitted sporadically worldwide. In
March 2020, WHO announced that the infection was a pandemic. COVID-19 outbreak and
rapid transmission have endangered global health and economy1. This crisis has called for an
extensive scientific mobilization of studies on SARS-CoV-2 focusing its clinical aspects,

characteristics, and its mechanism of transmission, with the ultimate aim of counteracting the
devastating outcomes2,3. Recently, there have been around 92 million people globally who
have been infected by the seventh coronavirus and more than 2 million deaths as the fast
result of this pandemic. Specifically, there are more than 850,000 cases and around 25,000
people died in Indonesia. These data are derived from Johns Hopkins University online
website that tracks COVID-19 cases in real-time4.
Meanwhile, on coronaviruses themselves, the family Coronaviridae is categorised into four
different genera: Gammacoronavirus, Deltacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, and
Alphacoronavirus. Both animals and humans can be infected by coronaviruses5. Moreover,
SARS-CoV-2 genome is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA of roughly 30,000 nucleotides.
There are four structural proteins encoded by the genome and spike (S) protein is the most
important one6. It is because S protein is the primary target antigen in the SARS-CoV-2
vaccine7. Previously, the candidate for a peptide-based vaccine against the virus based on the
four structural proteins was identified8,9. In addition, the interaction between the host and the
virus that causes infection involves a complex response of immune system10,11. On the other
hand, we demonstrated the paradoxical phenomenon called antibody-dependent enhancement
(ADE) within the Indonesian isolates12. Therefore, ADE has become a tipping point in the
cultivation of antibody-based therapies and vaccines10,11.
Recently, scientists are attempting to generate vaccines to fight against SARS-CoV-2
worldwide, with protein-based vaccines as the most advanced types and the private sector is
at the forefront of this study13,14,15,16. Unexpectedly/uncontrollably, the mutation rate of
Coronaviridae is reminding high. Various studies reported the mutation might be implicated
the efficacy of vaccines or other therapeutic strategies17,18,19. Furthermore, the newest type of
SARS-CoV-2 lineage occurred in UK at the end of 2020 and this case predicted as
sporadically would increase the number of the COVID-19 patients in UK. Thus, investigating
the full-length genome mutation analysis of 166 Indonesian SARS-CoV-2 isolates became
the goal of this study.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
SARS-CoV-2 Isolates
The data extraction of all Indonesian isolates (166 isolates) with SARS-CoV-2 from the
Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) EpiCoV database was completed
on 12 January 2021. This study only used the complete genome and high coverage criteria
according to the GISAID EpiCoV standard. All of 166 Indonesian SARS-CoV-2 isolates
were derived from various provinces in Indonesia, for example: Special Region of Aceh,
North Sumatra, Lampung, Banten, Special Capital Region of Jakarta, West Java, Central Java,
Special Region of Yogyakarta, East Java, and so on. This study identified the total isolates in
every province, GISAID clades, and lineages. All data were visualized using GraphPad Prism
software. Furthermore, WIV04 isolate (GISAID clade: L; lineage: B) collected from a female
retailer at Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market and submitted by the Wuhan Institute of
Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China was applied as a virus reference based on
CoVsurver default.
Full-Length Genome Mutation Analysis
Every single gene of 166 Indonesian SARS-CoV-2 isolates was investigated, such as
NSP1-16, S, NS3, E, M, NS6, NS7a, NS7b, NS8, and N. Also, D614G mutation and S
protein mutations in all isolates were identified. We employed CoVsurver to investigate the
full-length genome mutation analysis of all isolates. All data were visualized using GraphPad
Prism software and BioRender.

In this study, we rendered 3D structure visualization of SARS-CoV-2 S protein by
applying SWISS-MODEL web server and PyMOL v2.4. Then, the schematic diagram was
edited with BioRender. This method was functioned to easily identify the location of various
mutations in SARS-CoV-2 S protein.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Until at the end of 2019, there were six identified coronaviruses to be causative agents of
infection in humans. The seventh, SARS-CoV-2, emerged in China1. To date, according to
the CSSE at Johns Hopkins University, there are approximately 95 million people infected
with the virus globally4. Moreover, the reports said that human-to-human transmission has
occurred and WHO has acknowledged the chance of aerosol infection20. Based on the data,
the novel virus has been collected from saliva, throat, bronchoalveolar-lavage, oropharyngeal
swab, nasopharyngeal swab, and sputum.
The data of 166 Indonesian SARS-CoV-2 isolates were retrieved from the database prior to
the Indonesia’s COVID-19 vaccination program kick-started on 13 January 2021. The
database was the collective results from nasopharyngeal swab, oropharyngeal swab and
nasopharyngeal swab, and sputum methods which were used to collect the virus samples and
submitted by many collaborations among research centres and universities in Indonesia. The
166 isolates were originated from various provinces in Indonesia, such as Special Region of
Aceh, North Sumatra, Riau Islands, Lampung, Banten, Special Capital Region of Jakarta,
West Java, Central Java, Special Region of Yogyakarta, East Java, South Kalimantan, North
Kalimantan, Central Kalimantan, East Kalimantan, North Sulawesi, Bali, West Nusa
Tenggara, East Nusa Tenggara, North Papua, West Papua, dan Papua (Figure 1).
Recent updates show that the GISAID EpiCoV database has acknowledged seven subtypes
of SARS-CoV-2, specifically V, S, O, L, GR, GH, GV, and G clades. Significantly, the
isolates from Indonesia in this study were grouped in the G, GH, GR, L, and O clades.
Similarly, this study also reveals those above lineages of SARS-CoV-2 isolates in Indonesia
according to the accumulated data from GISAID EpiCoV (Figure 1). In this study, we
revealed 14 lineages from 166 isolates (Figure 1). However, based on this data, there are no
novel lineages identified related to new variants. In contrast, many reports stated that novel
variants of SARS-CoV-2 occurred in various countries, such as UK, Brazil and South
Africa21,22,23.24,25. Consequently, these novel variants might be more transmissible and
suspected to be accountable for the rise of COVID-19 patient numbers in those countries23,24.
On the other hand, the previous studies about the molecular phylogenetic tree revealed that
the relationship of SARS-CoV-2 and other Coronaviridae is based on the four structural
protein genes. In accordance with this, SARS-CoV-2 is considered to be the closest to
Rhinolophus affinis coronavirus RaTG13 and followed by pangolin coronavirus26. Thus,
Malayan pangolin is assumed as the intermediate host before infecting to humans 27.

Meanwhile, S protein mediates the entry and the new virus membrane fusion and is the
main target for many studies of antiviral drugs and vaccines28,29. S1 and S2 are the two
domains of the virus S protein (Figure 2). S1 is conscientious for binding to host cellular
receptors. Besides the efficacy of several therapies which include disrupting protease
inhibitors, small RNAs, neutralizing antibodies, fusion blockers, S protein inhibitors, ACE2
blockers, however, the in vitro studies on S protein inhibitors have been unsatisfactory30.
Many methods have been employed to produce vaccines using S protein as an antigen8,31.
Thus, it is very important to investigate the S protein from Indonesian SARS-CoV-2 isolates.
Scientists have demonstrated that mutations occur in the virus genome globally7,9,32,33.
Previously, Phan et al. performed a genetic analysis in 86 virus genomes and reported many
mutations. One of the most important mechanisms proposed for the evolution of viruses in
nature is nucleotide substitution7. Meanwhile, Yadav et al. also reported a study to analyse
the first two virus isolates from India34. In line with this, Garcés-Ayala et al. conducted a
study with the reference sequence for fully describing the novel SARS-CoV-2 complete
genome in Mexico35. Concurrently, Khailany et al. retrieved 94 SARS-CoV-2 genomes and
checked the molecular variation between them36. Whilst, Kim et al. also revealed that the
quick transmission and infectivity of the virus correlated with specific mutations in the
genome37. Simultaneously, this study reported various S protein mutations such as A222,
S477, D614, Q677, and so on. Further research was highly considered that S protein
mutations to affect vaccination program worldwide38,39,40.
Recent publications shows that one of the most notable amino acid mutations is D614G12,13.
Based on these recent studies, the virus virulence and the increase of viral loads in COVID19 patients characterise the occurrence of D614G mutation40,41. While, based on the current
available information, the infectivity as well as the receptor binding, fusion activation, or

ADE enhancement can be influenced by D614G mutation in several ways10,11,12. An antibody
escape is considered as another mutation mechanism like the upcoming form of D614G
which can be accelerated by an antigenic drift. If the sensitivity of neutralizing antibody can
be affected by D614G mutation in SARS-CoV-2 or vice versa, then, the ADE activity also
can be monitored in the SARS-CoV study, thus, D614G can be considered as an intermediate
antibody escape which puts people to be more vulnerable for second infections 12,40,42.
In this study, D614G mutation was detected in 103 Indonesian SARS-CoV-2 isolates. All
the isolates were mostly from the West Java, East Java, Special Region of Yogyakarta,
Special Capital Region of Jakarta, and Central Java, respectively (Figure 2). This result is in
line with a study by Zhang et al. on D614G mutation which discovered that S1 residue 614 is
in a close proximity to S2 domain. An altered release or shedding of S1 domain after
cleavage at S1/S2 junction might be displayed by the ratio between S1 and S2 domains in the
virion. Glycine Amino Acid found at residue 614 of S protein G614 secures the interaction
between S1 and S2 domains and limits S1 shedding. D614G mutation has been previously
speculated in raising an open configuration of S protein that is more advantageous to ACE2
association40. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 S protein D614G mutation is highly believed in
promoting the virion spike density and infectivity and it is also highly speculated that this
mutation might be influence further mutations. In addition, the previous study also reported
that the type of mutation emerged in the virus isolates were originated from canine,
environment, Felis catus, Mus musculus, Mustela lutreola, and Panthera tigris jacksoni12.

In the meantime, compared to most other microorganisms, the rates of RNA viruses’
mutations are much higher43. An elevated mutation rate can lead to an increase in virulence
and a high potential for adaptive evolution43,44. This capability boosts the chance of zoonotic
viral pathogens to establish human-to-human transmission and permits them to enhance their
virulence45.

This study provides the fundamental data for accomplished studies into the medication and
prevention of COVID-19. Indonesian SARS-CoV-2 genomic data extraction would be
valuable in vaccine construction and options in medication. In fact, mining the data of the
Indonesian SARS-CoV-2 variants and molecular epidemiology could enable the mapping of
its origin and the tracking of its transmission46. In line with this, the sequence investigation
performs an important role in viral surveillance, public health policy problems, and host
identification46,47. Thus, high-speed detection of mutations from the Indonesian SARS-CoV-2
is mandatory in the unlocking to the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia.
Currently, the availability of COVID-19 vaccine is limited, not many people can access it.
In countries that have not implemented large-scale active case testing and isolation,
controlling the spread of the virus can be a challenge. In this case, transmission suppression
relies primarily on the community adherence to non-pharmacological strategies such as social
distancing, the mandatory mask using, and hand washing48,49,50,51. Inevitably, as the result of
SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks, many countries declared medical emergency which led to economic
emergency since those countries enforcing limited or strict mobility both regionally and
nationally52,53,54. Thus, in regulating and containing further transmission of COVID-19, it is a
fundamental move to discover the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 genome and constitute the
systems for observing SARS-CoV-2 during this pandemic. Furthermore, the recognition of
genotypes related to temporal infectious clusters and specific geographic areas recommends
that the employment of genomic data is highly recommended in observing and tracking the
further spreading of SARS-CoV-2. Likewise, researchers might be able to introduce the
origin of a specific variant and observe the virus transmission by acknowledging the specific
SARS-CoV-2 variants and connecting them using a molecular epidemiology approach. Ergo,
it can be argued that this study might become an important tool in regulating the COVID-19
pandemic in Indonesia.
CONCLUSION
In conclusion, this study successfully identified the full-length genome mutation analysis
of 166 Indonesian SARS-CoV-2 isolates. This study helps in observing the spread of the
COVID-19 transmission. However, we proposed that the epidemiological surveillance and
genomics studies might be improved on COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia.
