Abstract
The discovery of epitopes is helpful to the development of SARSCoV-2 vaccine. The sequences of the surface protein of SARS-CoV-2 and
its proximal sequences were obtained by BLAST, the sequences of the
whole genome of SARS-CoV-2 were obtained from the GenBank. Based
on the NCBI Reference Sequence: NC_045512.2, the conformational and
linear B cell epitopes of the surface protein were predicted separately by
various prediction methods. Furthermore, the conservation of the epitopes,
the adaptability and other evolutionary characteristics were also analyzed.
7 epitopes were predicted, including 5 linear epitopes and 2 conformational
epitopes, one of the linear and one of the conformational were coincide.
The epitope D mutated easily, but the other epitopes were very
conservative and the epitope C was the most conservative. It is worth
mentioning that all of the 6 dominated epitopes were absolutely
conservative in nearly 1000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes, and they deserved
further study. The findings would facilitate the vaccine development, had
the potential to be directly applied on the treatment in this disease, but also
have the potential to prevent the possible threats caused by other types of
coronavirus.

Introduction
In late December 2019, a novel coronavirus was officially named as SARS-CoV2 by World Health Organization(WHO) and identified as the pathogen causing
outbreaks of SARS-like and MERS-like illness in Chinese city of Wuhan, which was a
zoonotic disease. As of March 13, 2020, the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 has been reported
in many areas of the world, with more than 130,000 people infected[1]. With an
alarmingly human-to-human transmissibility, the reproductive number of SARS-CoV2 has been computed to around 3.28 [2]. According to the data in NGDC(National
Genomics Data Center), at 15:00(GMT+8) on March 13, 2020, 482 genomic variations
of SARS-CoV-2 has been reported, which has aroused widespread concern.
The B cell epitope of viral surface protein can specifically bind to the host’s B cell
antigen receptor and induce the body to produce protective antibody and humoral
immune response. The discovery of epitopes is helpful to the development of SARSCoV-2 vaccine and the understanding of SARS-CoV-2’s pathogenesis[3]. 3 proteins
embedded in the virus envelope of SARS-CoV-2 have been identified, Spike(S) protein,
Envelope(E) protein, Membrane(M) protein. At present, due to the lack of study of the
crystal structure of surface protein of SARS-CoV-2, the study of epitopes is timeconsuming, power-consuming, cost and difficult [4].
In this work, we analyzed the surface protein of SARS-CoV-2, predicted the
structures with bioinformatics methods. On the basis, we predicted the linear and
conformational B cell epitopes, analyzed the conservation of the epitopes, the
adaptability and other evolutionary characteristics of the surface protein, which
provided a theoretical basis for the vaccine development and prevention of SARS-CoV2.

Results
Basic analysis of surface protein of SARS-CoV-2
The primary structure and physicochemical properties of the S/E/M protein were
analyzed. The results revealed that the S protein has an average hydrophilic index of -

0.079(Figure S1A). On the basis of hydrophilicity, it also showed amphoteric
properties. There was an outside-in transmembrane helix in 23 residues from position
1214th to position 1236th at the N-terminal(Figure S2A). The protein instability index
was 33.01, which revealed the S protein was stable. The E protein has an average
hydrophilic index of 1.128(Figure S1B). It was hydrophobic. An inside-out
transmembrane helix in 23 residues from position 12th to position 34th at the N-terminal
was predicted(Figure S2B). The protein instability index was 38.68, which revealed the
E protein was stable. The M protein has an average hydrophilic index of 0.446(Figure
S1C). On the basis of hydrophobicity, it also showed amphoteric properties. There were
two outside-in transmembrane helices, one was in 20 residues from position 20th to
position 39th, the another one was in 23 residues from position 78th to position 100th,
and an inside-out transmembrane helix in 20 residues from position 51st to position 73rd,
at the N-terminal(Figure S2C). The protein instability index was 39.14, which revealed
the M protein was stable.
Prediction of the 3D structure of surface protein of SARS-CoV-2
The optimal template for homology modeling of the S protein of SARS-CoV-2
was the S protein of SARS(PDB ID: 6acc.1), with the sequence identity of 76.47% and
the GMQE score of 0.73. According to the evaluation of the structure by Ramachandran
plot(Figure 1A), 99.3% of the residues were located in the most favoured regions and
the allowed regions, 0.7% of the residues were located in the disallowed regions, the
high-energy regions(Table 1), which was possibly due to some energy was spent in the
protein processing to make these residues enter the high-energy regions [5]. The result
generally showed that the structure was reliable. The structure of S protein(Figure 1B)
of SARS-CoV-2 is a trimer, which can be divided into a tightly curled tail and a
distributed head. The head is mainly composed of β-sheet, irregular curl and turn, which
is exposed to the envelope of the virus, contributes to the formation of epitopes. The
tail is mainly composed of several α-helices, part of which is embedded in the envelope,
hinders the formation of epitopes.
The optimal template for homology modeling of the E protein of SARS-CoV-2
was the E protein of SARS(PDB ID: 5x29.1), with the sequence identity of 91.38% and

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.03.022723; this version posted April 5, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

the GMQE score of 0.73. According to the evaluation of the structure by Ramachandran
plot(Figure 1C), 100% of the residues were located in the most favoured regions(Table
1), indicating that the structure was reliable. The E protein of SARS-CoV-2 is a
pentamer(Figure 1D), which can be divided into the concentrated transmembrane part
and the head located outside the envelope. The head is mainly composed of α-helix,
irregular curl and turn, which is exposed to the envelope, contributes to the formation
of epitopes. The tail is mainly composed of long α-helix, most of which are embedded
in the envelope, hinders the formation of epitopes.
The optimal template for homology modeling of the M protein of SARS-CoV-2
was the effector protein Zt-KP6-1(PDB ID: 6qpk. 1. A), with the sequence identity of
20.00% and the GMQE score of 0.06. The sequence identity between the optimal
template and the M protein of SARS-CoV-2 and the GMQE score are too low, so that
the template is not suitable for homology modeling.
Prediction of linear B cell epitopes
All linear B cell epitopes of the surface protein were filtered according to the
following criteria: (1) region with high surface probability(≥0.75), strong
antigenicity(≥0) and high flexibility; (2) excluding the region with α-helix, β-sheet and
glycosylation site(Figure 2); (3) in line with the prediction by BepiPred 2.0(cut off to
0.35)(Table S1) and ABCpred(cut off to 0.51)(Table S2). Based on the results obtained
with these methods and artificial optimization, 4 potential linear B cell epitopes of the
S protein were predicted(Table 2, Figure 3A), including 601-605 aa, 656-660 aa, 676682 aa, 808-813 aa, and they were named as the epitope A, B, C, D, respectively; 1
epitope of the E protein was selected(60-65 aa) and named as the epitope F(Table 2,
Figure 3C); 1 epitope of the M protein was selected (211-215 aa) and named as the
epitope H(Table 2).
Prediction of conformational B cell epitopes
The conformational B cell epitopes of surface protein were predicted with
Ellipro(Table S3) and SEPPA 3.0(Table S4) with the threshold of 0.063 and 0.5,
respectively. After the artificial optimization, one conformational B-cell epitope (403405,416,445,446,455,500 aa) of S protein was predicted(Table 2). It is obvious that the

region located on the head of the S protein(Figure 3B), which is the outside of SARSCoV-2, making it easy to form an epitope. We selected it as a dominant conformational
epitope and named it as the epitope E. Additionally, one conformational B-cell
epitope(60-65 aa) of E protein was predicted(Table 2), which is consistent with the
epitope F of the E protein. Similarly, this region located on the outside(Figure 3C), we
selected it as a dominant conformational epitope and named G. However, the
conformational epitope of the M protein could not be predicted due to the failure of
credible homology modeling.
Analysis of epitope conservation
The Consurf Server was used to predict epitope conservative sites with the
structure of surface proteins and the alignment results in different datasets (Table S5).
All the epitopes of the S, E, M protein were absolute conservative among all SARSCoV-2 sequences(Table 3A, Figure S3A-G). To further calculate the conservation of
the epitopes in different coronavirus datasets, the representative sequences from SARSCoV-2 were selected to participate in the human coronavirus dataset and the
coronavirus dataset, due to amino acid sequences of some S or E or M protein were
absolute conservative in SARS-CoV-2. The conservation was a little lower in human
coronavirus than those of in SARS-CoV-2(Table 3B, Figure S4A-G), and the epitope D
was easy to mutate. The other epitopes were conservative and the epitope F/G was the
most conservative one. As for the coronavirus(Table 3C, Figure S5A-G), in the 5
epitopes of S protein, 4 of which obtained the conservative score less than 1, ranging
from -0.854 to 0.256. It showed that the epitope C with the minimum score is the most
stable and not easy to mutate. Besides, the score of the epitope D was 1.247, showing
the relatively high possibility to mutate. The epitopes of the E protein were stable with
the conservative score less than 1. The site conservation of the M protein could not be
predicted due to the failure of credible homology modeling.

Discussion
SARS-CoV-2 caused huge impact to human production, living and even life, has

become a major challenge confronting the whole world. Development of vaccine is one
of the effective means of prevention and treatment of the virus long-term. Epitope
vaccine is the trend of development of vaccine due to the advantages of strong
pertinence, less toxic and side effects and easy to transportation and storage [6]. The
determination of epitopes is the basis of the development and application of vaccine,
and the clinical diagnosis and treatment. Currently, the methods which were mainly
used are X- crystal diffraction method, immune experiment method and bioinformatics
method. The first two are time-consuming and laborious, the bioinformatics method is
gaining more and more credibility among researchers [3,6,7]. There are many factors
to be considered in the prediction of epitopes by bioinformatics method, such as the
surface probablity and flexibility of the epitopes. At the same time, it is necessary to
exclude the structurally stable and non-deformable α-helix, β-sheet, glycosylation sites
which may obscure the epitopes or alter the antigenicity, etc [8]. Even so, the predicted
epitopes are still inaccurate [4]. Compared with the current study on SARS-CoV-2, this
work adopted various prediction methods and 3D structure databases developed in
recent years, which were based on artificial neural network, Hidden Markov
Model(HMM), Support Vector Machine(SVM), etc, such as ABCpred, BepiPred2.0,
SEPPA 3.0, IEDB, etc. Compared with prediction by a single method [9] or on the basis
of epitopes of SARS [10], these methods and databases greatly improved the accuracy
of prediction and had more bioinformatic meaning. We comprehensively analyzed the
prediction results from the tools which were widely used, set up screening criteria on
the basis of primary structure, secondary structure and tertiary structure, so that the
prediction results would more accurate and reliable.
The S protein, the E protein and the M protein are surface proteins of SARS-CoV2, which have the potential as antigenic molecules. However, the current study on the
epitopes prediction of SARS-CoV-2 [11], due to the S protein has been reported to be
the directly binding molecule of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2[12], the prediction of epitopes
is mainly focusing on the S protein, with few studies on the E protein and the M protein.
In this work, we analyzed the S protein, the E protein and the M protein, predicted their
epitopes. On the basis, 7 B cell epitopes were predicted, including 2 conformational

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.03.022723; this version posted April 5, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

and 6 linear B cell epitopes, one of the conformational and one of the linear are coincide.
All of the epitope A, B, C, D located on the surface of the tail of the S protein, which is
relatively easy to bind. The epitope E is located on the head of the S protein, which is
the key area where the S protein recognizes and binds to ACE2 [12,13], has the potential
to block the infection process. The epitope F and the epitope G located on the end of
the head of the E protein, the two epitopes coincide, this may due to they are all
consecutive and the secondary structure avoided the α-helix and the β-sheet. The
epitope H is derived from the M protein, the structure and conservation could not be
determined due to the inability to predict reliable structure. However, it could be known
from the surface probablity scores that the epitope H is more likely to be located on the
surface of the M protein.
The higher the conservation score calculated by the Consurf Server is, the more
likely the site is to be mutated in the evolutionary process. When the score<1, the site
is likely to be a conservative site; when the score is between 1 and 2, the site is a site
which is likely to be a relatively easy mutation; when the score>2, the site is likely to
be an easy mutation site [14]. In the 7 epitopes obtained, all the epitopes of the S, E, M
protein were absolute conservative among all SARS-CoV-2 sequences. For the human
coronavirus dataset and the coronavirus dataset, only the average conservative score of
the epitope D is higher than 1, which is prone to mutation. The epitope D should not be
used as an epitope of the S protein. The conservation of the epitope H could not be
calculated by the PDB file, the application value of the epitope H needed further
experimental verification. Although the epitopes could be integrally considered to be
conservative, the independent residues of these epitopes could still easy to mutate.
Except the epitope E, all of 6 dominate epitopes contain 1-2 residues which has a
conservative score higher than 1(Table 3C), indicating that these residues were likely
to be easy mutation sites. These residues mostly located at the head or the tail of the
epitopes, therefore, the mutation of these residues should be paid attention to, and the
length of the epitopes should be adjusted according to the actual effect in application.
The scores of epitopes in different datasets were different, which could due to the
quantity of sequences in the datasets and the structures were analyzed in different

situations.
In this work, we predicted 6 reliable epitopes: A, B, C, E, F/G and H. The reliability
of the epitopes of the S protein was relatively better than that of the epitopes of the E
protein and the M protein, indicating that the S protein is still the optimal choice for the
prediction of epitopes and the development of vaccine. All of the 6 epitopes were able
to achieve absolute conservation in SARS-CoV-2, and to achieve relative conservation
in the data set, including SARS, etc. Therefore, the epitopes not only have the potential
to be directly applied on the treatment in this disease, but also have the potential to
prevent the possible threats caused by other types of coronavirus. In addition, although
various factors of prediction were integrated in this work, more experimental data are
needed to further verify whether all the 6 epitopes can induce the body to produce
corresponding antibodies and generate specific humoral immunity, due to the limited
data set and other factors.

Materials and methods
Materials
All of the analysis was based on the NCBI Reference Sequence: NC_045512.2.
We obtained the sequence of S, E and M protein and its proximal sequences by BLAST,
which got 420, 334 and 329 sequences in total from NCBI database respectively. We
obtained the whole genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 from Genbank and GISAID(959
in total), which were used to be a dataset after genome annotation. The genome
sequences, which performed mistakes of translation, were deleted.
Methods
Basic analysis of surface protein of SARS-CoV-2
The physical and chemical properties of target protein were analyzed by the PortParam tool in ExPASy [15], including the primary structure of the target protein,
molecular formula, theoretical isoelectric point, the protein instability index(the
index<40 means the protein was stable), etc. Online software, ProtScale, was used to
deeply analyze the hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of target protein and the

distribution of hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of polypeptide chains [15]. SARSCoV-2 carried the S/E/M protein through the virus envelope, the transmembrane region
of the protein was predicted online by TMHMM 2.0 [16].
Prediction of the 3D structure of target protein
With the amino acid sequences of the surface protein of SARS-CoV-2 of
NC_045512.2 as templates, based on homology modeling method, we predicted the 3D
structure through the online server SWISS-MODEL[17], selected and optimized the
optimal structure based on the template identity and GMQE value[17], the rationality
of the structure was evaluated by Ramachandran plot [18] with PDBsum server. The
structures were displayed and analyzed by SWISS-pdb Viewer v4.10 [19].
Prediction of conformational B cell epitopes of target protein of SARS-CoV-2
Based on the structures, the conformational B cell epitopes were predicted by
SEPPA 3.0 [20] and Ellipro [21] respectively, and the common predicted
conformational B cell epitopes from two methods were selected for the further analysis.
Prediction of linear B cell epitopes of target protein of SARS-CoV-2
The Protean module of DNAStar was used to predict the flexibility[21], surface
probablity [22] and antigenic index [23] of the target protein of SARS-CoV-2. The
linear B cell epitope was predicted by ABCpred [24] and BepiPred 2.0 [25] respectively
and the common predicted linear B cell epitopes from two methods were selected for
the further analysis. Coupled with the secondary structure, the tertiary structure and the
glycosylation sites [26] etc, the linear B cell epitopes were finally determined.
Analysis of epitope conservation
Based on the PDB model and the multiple alignment result, we used the Consurf
Server to analyze the conservation of amino acid sites of the epitopes online[27]. The
conservation of epitopes on the surface protein of SARS-CoV-2 was analyzed by
multiple alignment with MAFFT and Logo was drawn with Weblogo [28,29].

Figure S1 Deep analysis of hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of surface protein of
SARS-CoV-2
The online software, ProtScale, was used to predict the hydrophilicity and
hydrophobicity of the surface protein deeply. A. The S protein has a maximum score of
hydrophobicity, 3.222 at the 7th site, which revealed a strong hydrophobicity; a
minimum score of hydrophobicity, -2.589 at the 679th site, which revealed a strong

hydrophilicity. The score of hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity on the polypeptide chain
of S protein constantly fluctuates, with most of the scores being negative, which
revealed the possibility that the protein had bisexual properties on the basis of
hydrophilicity. B. The E protein has a maximum score of hydrophobicity, 3.489 at the
21st and the 25th site, which revealed a strong hydrophobicity; a minimum score of
hydrophobicity, -1.550 at the 65th site, which revealed a strong hydrophilicity. Most of
the scores of the residues being positive, which revealed the possibility that the protein
has obvious hydrophobicity. C. The M protein has a maximum score of hydrophobicity,
2.978 at the 84th site, which revealed a strong hydrophobicity; a minimum score of
hydrophobicity, -1.956 at the 211th and the 212th site, which revealed a strong
hydrophilicity. The scores of hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity on the polypeptide
chain of M protein showed large fluctuations, and the number of positive scores and
negative scores were similar, the positive scores accounted for the majority, which
revealed the possibility that the protein had bisexual properties on the basis of
hydrophobicity.

The transmembrane region of the surface protein of SARS-CoV-2

The S, E and M protein are embedded in the envelope of SARS-CoV-2, the
transmembrane helix was predicted by TMHMM 2.0 server. All of three amino acid
indexes were higher than 18, indicating the reliability of the prediction. A. For the S
protein, an outside-in transmembrane helix was predicted in the 23 residues of amino
acids from position 1214th to position 1236th at the N-terminal. The amino acid index
was 23.97303. B. For the E protein, an inside-out transmembrane helix was predicted
in the 23 residues of amino acids from position 12th to position 34th at the N-terminal.
The amino acid index was 25.72521. C. For the M protein, 2 outside-in transmembrane
helices were predicted, which were a helix in the 20 residues of amino acids from
position 20th to position 39th and a helix in the 23 residues of amino acids from position
78th to position 100th at the N-terminal. An inside-out helix was predicted in the 23
residues of amino acids from position 51st to position 73rd at the N-terminal. The amino
acid index was 64.90522.
