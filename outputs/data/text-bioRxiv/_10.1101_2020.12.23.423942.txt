Abstract

26

Objectives:

27

In order to find out the association between the sensorineural hearing loss and COVID-19, we

28

detected the expression ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the mouse the hamster.

29

Design

30

Using the public data from NCBI and GISAID, we assessed the expression of ACE2 and

31

TMPRSS2 at the transcriptomic, DNA, and protein levels of ACE2 in the brain, inner ear, and

32

muscle from the golden Syrian hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) and mouse (Mus musculus).

33

Results:

34

We identified ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expressed at different level in the inner ear and brain at DNA

35

and transcriptomic levels of both mouse and the hamster. The protein expression shows a similar

36

pattern of the brain and inner ear, while the expression of ACE2 from the inner ear was relatively

37

higher than it from the muscle.

38

Conclusion:

39

SARS-CoV-2 could infect the hearing system potentially and SSNHL could be a characteristic to

40

detect asymptomatic patients of COVID-19.

Keywords: SSNHL, COVID-19, small animal models, inner ear

within a few months highlights the importance of early diagnosis of COVID-19. Meanwhile, the

45

increasing trend of the confirmed cases draws more attention to the treatment and prognosis of

46

COVID-19 patients. Some recent clinical studies observed some un-specific symptoms of

47

COVID-19, including headache, diarrhea, and sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) (Kilic

48

et al. 2020; Harenberg, Jonas, and Trecca 2020); one case has reported profound sensorineural

49

hearing damage in a 60-year-old COVID-19 patient (Degen, Lenarz, and Willenborg 2020). To our

50

acknowledge, the ACE2 receptor is a key for SARS-Cov-2 entry human cells while TMPRSS2 is

51

highly involved in virus replication, the co-expression of which two could mainly determine the

52

level of damage to the hosts. It has been previously investigated that the expression of ACE2 and

53

TMPRSS2 was high in the intestine and kidney of humans compared to the brain and lung.

54

Although several clinical studies confirmed the most common symptoms of COVID-19, SSNHL

55

were also found but not draw much attention due to they are similarity to the symptoms of the flu

56

or cold. SARS-CoV-2 could infect many organs, including the hearing center, which could invade

57

the cochlear nerve and lead to SSNHL and cause hearing damage after treatment of the patients

58

with COVID-19. We have already demonstrated the golden hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) could

59

be a better small animal model for COVID-19 compared to a mouse (Mus musculus) for

60

understanding the efficiency and possibility of SARS-CoV-2 attacking human cells with certain or

61

potential consequences.

Methods

Experimentation Ethics Committee of the Henan University of Chinese Medicine (No.

sequence of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 was aligned with Clustral Omega (V1.2.3) and reconstructed

67

phylogeny, calculated distance by using MEGA v5.2. 1000 maximum number of iterations were

68

applied with Kimura two factor correction method for genetic distance prediction. Cufflinks

69

v2.2.1 with Bowtie2 (Langmead and Salzberg 2012) were used for expression analysis of

70

transcriptomes from different tissues in humans, mice, and hamsters. We next ran quantitative

71

real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blot on seven tissues from both mouse and the hamster to

72

quantitate the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. All experimental details are included in the

73

supplementary file.

74

Results

75

Gene ACE2 and TMPRSS2 of the mouse and hamster are over 80% similarity to humans (figure

76

1A). We found ACE2 expressed higher in the heart of humans and slightly higher in the brain of

77

both human and mouse, while TMPRSS2 shows high expression in the lungs of both human and

78

mouse but lower in the brain (figure 1B). In addition, we found a similar pattern of the hamster

79

and human; Both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were highly expressed in the spleen and relatively high in

80

the liver, but not in the brain (figure 1C). The mRNA expression of ACE2 shows high in the inner

81

ear of both the mouse and hamster, while TMPRSS2 was much higher expressed in the lung

82

compared to the inner ear. However, both genes showed lower expression levels in the brains of

83

these two animal models. The protein expression shows a similar pattern of the brain and inner ear,

84

while the expression of ACE2 from the inner ear was relatively higher than it from the muscle

85

(figure 1D, E, F).

Discussion

87

We hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 might infect the inner ear by binding to ACE2, which is the

88

main reason causing sensorineural hearing loss by pathogens invasion. Some studies found ACE2,

89

TMPRSS2, and Furin expressed in the middle ear of a mouse, promising in our data from the

90

present study (Uranaka et al. 2020). Since the transcriptome data from the inner ear specifically

91

has not been available on NCBI, the brain was chosen as an alternative tissue (Zhang et al. 2020).

92

We found ACE2 did express in the inner ear of both the mouse and the hamster, although the

93

expression level was different compared to ACE2 expressed in the lung. TMPRSS2 shows high

94

expression in the lungs compared to it in the inner ear, which might be the reason the symptoms of

95

COVID-19 in the respiratory is more severe in the inner ear. More sophisticated work is required

96

to understand the molecular mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 infecting the inner ear and causing

97

sensorineural hearing loss.
