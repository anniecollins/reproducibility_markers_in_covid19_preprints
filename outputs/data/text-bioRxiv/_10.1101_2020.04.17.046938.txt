Abstract
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Age,
smoking, obesity, and chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes have been
described as risk factors for severe complications and mortality in COVID-19. Obesity and
diabetes are usually associated with dysregulated lipid synthesis and clearance which can
initiate or aggravate pulmonary inflammation and injury. It has been shown that for viral entry
into the host cell, SARS-CoV-2 utilizes the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors
present on the cells. We aimed to characterize how SARS-CoV-2 dysregulates lipid
metabolism pathways in the host and the effect of dysregulated lipogenesis on the regulation
of ACE2, specifically in obesity. In our study, through the re-analysis of publicly available
transcriptomic data, we first found that lung epithelial cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 showed
upregulation of genes associated with lipid metabolism, including the SOC3 gene which is
involved in regulation of inflammation and inhibition of leptin signaling. This is of interest as
viruses may hijack host lipid metabolism to allow completion of their viral replication cycles.
Furthermore, a mouse model of diet-induced obesity showed a significant increase in Ace2
expression in the lungs which negatively correlated with the expression of genes that code for
sterol response element binding proteins 1 and 2 (SREBP). Suppression of Srebp1 showed a
significant increase in Ace2 expression in the lung. Together our results suggest that the
dysregulated lipogenesis and the subsequently high ACE2 expression in obese patients might
be the mechanism underlying the increased risk for severe complications in those patients when
infected by SARS-CoV-2.

Introduction
As the COVID-19 pandemic is accelerating, people worldwide are warned to take necessary
precautions to avoid infection. With changing statistics every day, it is clear that certain groups
of individuals are at increased risk of severe infection. In particular, the groups at risk are the
elderly, individuals with chronic health conditions such as diabetes, cancer and cardiovascular
diseases. Most cases of COVID-19 are classified as mild or moderate. However, 14% of the
cases are severe and may lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and even death
in those infected (1). Therefore, it is crucial to understand the mechanism by which this virus
causes organ injury and, in particular the immune system which is mounted in response to the
infection. A few studies have now identified other risk factors for severe complications and
death due to COVID-19, namely smoking and obesity (2, 3). The findings related to obesity
are plausible since obese individuals tend to be more difficult to intubate, and excess body
weight may contribute to increased pressure on the diaphragm which may make breathing more
difficult during infection. Moreover, it is well established that obesity leads to chronic metainflammation even in the absence of infection which has detrimental effects on the immune
system (4). In addition, obesity is associated with dysregulated lipid synthesis and clearance
which can initiate or aggravate pulmonary inflammation. It has also been shown that antiviral
medication and vaccines are less effective in obese individuals (5). In relation to the influenza
virus, obesity may have a role in the viral life cycle which along with a dysregulated immune
system could lead to severe complications (6). During the H1N1 pandemic in 2009, obesity
was classified as an independent risk factor for hospitalization, need for mechanical ventilation
and death. These observations are concerning since over one third of the world population are
classified as overweight or obese (7). Therefore, as this current COVID-19 pandemic is
increasing, it is important to understand the molecular mechanisms through which obesity
increases the complications related to COVID-19 to hopefully be able to design more
appropriate therapies. Moreover, understanding the effects of obesity on COVID-19 may shed
light on the pathogenecity of SARS-CoV-2.
The mode of cellular entry of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, SARSCoV-2, is through its binding to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and is similar to
SARS-CoV responsible for the 2003 pandemic (8). Specifically, the spike glycoprotein on the
virion binds to peptidase domain of ACE2. Physiologically, ACE2 is part of the reninangiotensin system (RAS) and serves as a key regulator of systemic blood pressure through the
cleavage of Angiotensin (Ang) I to generate the inactive Ang 1-9 peptide and it directly

metabolizes Ang II to generate Ang 1-7 limiting its effects on vasoconstriction and fibrosis.
Other than serving as a functional receptor for SARS-CoV, ACE2 has been shown to be
implicated in cardiovascular pathologies, diabetes and lung disease. It is expressed by cells of
the heart, kidney and more specifically in lung epithelial cells (9). Although ACE2 expression
correlates with susceptibility of SARS-CoV infection, the relationship between ACE2 and
SARS-CoV-2 remains unclear. In fact, studies have suggested a protective role for ACE2
where overexpression of ACE2 attenuates lung inflammation (10). Current research is focusing
on the regulation and role of this receptor in relation to SARS-CoV-2. The aim of this study
was to identify mechanisms, through re-analysis of publicly available transcriptomic data, by
which SARS-CoV-2 dysregulates the lipid mechanism pathways and investigate the effect of
dysregulated lipogenesis on the regulation of ACE2, specifically in obesity.

Materials and Methods
Differentially expressed genes in bronchial epithelial cells infected with SARS-CoV-2
In order to identify essential differentially expressed genes in SARS-CoV-2 infected versus
non-infected epithelial cells, we re-analyzed the publicly available transcriptomic dataset
(GSE147507) recently uploaded to the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (11). Independent
biological triplicates of primary human lung epithelium (NHBE) were mock-treated or infected
with SARS-CoV-2 (USA-WA1/2020), then subjected to whole transcriptomic analysis using
RNA-Sequencing on Illumina Next Seq 500. The Raw Read Counts were retrieved and filtered
from non-expressing genes that showed zero counts in the six samples. Out of the original
23710 genes, only 15487 were expressing and selected for further analysis. The filtered gene
expression was uploaded to AltAnalyze software for Comprehensive Transcriptome
Analysis(12). Principle component analysis and Heatmap clustering were generated, and
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using LIMMA algorithm built in
AltAnalyze software . The genes that made the optimal hierarchal cosine clustering were
identified, and the common pathways shared by these genes are listed according to their
significance. Graphical visualization of the gene was made using the Metascape online tool
for gene ontology (http://metascape.org) (13).

Results
SARS-CoV-2 differentially expressed genes related to lipid metabolism in epithelial cells
121 DEGs in infected versus non-infected cells were identified, and they clustered the two
groups separately (Figure 1). As expected, the top pathways where the DEGs by SARS-CoV2 are involved were related to inflammatory, immune, cytokines, and antiviral responses.

Figure 1: Heatmap and clustering of SARS-CoV-2 infected healthy epithelial cells
versus noninfected (mock-infected cells) using GSE147507 publicly available
transcriptomics dataset. Pathways, where the DEGs are involved, are shown on the right
side of the heatmap with their adjusted p-value. The C1 represent pathways of genes
downregulated in infected cells, while C2 represent pathways of genes upregulated when
cells are infected compared to mock-infected cells.

Top DEGs in infected cells can have a role in white fat differentiation
Of note, as shown in Figure 1, genes involved in lipid storage and high-density lipoprotein
particles were among the top upregulated genes by the virus. To have a detailed analysis of
the pathways where the top DEGs in infected versus non-infected epithelial cells are involved,

we uploaded the 121 DEGs to metascape online tool. Again, most of the DEGs were involved
in immune response-related such as Interleukin (IL)-17 signaling pathway. This result was
expected and validated our bioinformatics analysis (14) .IL-10 signaling pathway, acute
inflammatory response, metal sequestration by antimicrobial proteins, defense response to
another organism, negative regulation of apoptotic signaling pathway, acute-phase response,
cellular response to tumor necrosis factor, response to antibiotic and modulation by a host of
the viral process (Figure 2 and table 1) were also involved . Other sets of enriched pathways
are related to cell and tissue homeostasis like positive regulation of cell migration, blood vessel
morphogenesis, regulation of bone resorption, activation of matrix metalloproteinases, and
regulation of smooth muscle cell proliferation. The third set was related to metabolic pathways
like negative regulation of ion transport, regulation of glucose metabolic process, the release
of cytochrome c from mitochondria, and regulation of fat cell differentiation.
De novo cellular lipogenesis, if disturbed, can change cell deformability as it influences the
phospholipid composition of cellular membranes and, as a consequence, can disturb
transmembrane receptors like growth factor receptor needed for cell survival (15). Based on
that we were interested in deciphering the effect of viral infection on epithelial cells lipid
metabolism pathways and how the disturbed lipid metabolism, like in obesity and diabetes,
might worsen the condition of COVID-19

Negative regulator of lipogenesis was downregulated in infected cells
In this study, IL6, MMP11, ZC3H12A, PTPRQ, and EGR2 were found to share a common
pathway related to the regulation of fat cell differentiation. Of interest, PTPRQ and EGR2
showed significant downregulation in infected cells compared to mock-infected epithelial cells,
as shown in Figure 3. PTPRQ is protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) that regulate tyrosine
phosphorylation in signal transduction, and the encoded protein is a negative regulator of
mesenchymal stem cell differentiation into adipocytes (16). It is synthesized in the lung and
kidney and is downregulated in the early stages of adipogenesis(17). Recent studies linked

SARS-CoV-2 upregulate leptin signaling regulator SOCS-3
Next, we tried to look for the trend of changes in the expression of genes involved in lipid
metabolism (although the differences were not statistically significant) but this data can give
us an idea about the deranged lipid-related pathways. To visualize the leptin signaling
pathways, the filtered gene expression was uploaded to PathVisio pathway analysis and
drawing software(19). As shown in Figure 4, there is derangement of a leptin signaling pathway

in terms of upregulation or downregulation of genes involved, of note the SOCS3, STAT1,
NFKB1 and IL1B were the top upregulated genes. Most individuals with obesity have leptin
resistance by leptin and its receptor inhibitor SOCS-3 (suppressor of cytokine signaling-3),
leading to dysfunction of leptin biological function(20)

Lung ACE2 expression was significantly upregulated in obese mice
We then questioned whether disturbed lipid metabolism in obesity could affect the major
players' host genes involved in virus binding and entry, namely ACE2. Apart from the
circulating RAS, the local lung-based RAS plays a specific role in the injury/repair
response(21) and recently was documented to have a pro-fibrotic effect independent of the
known blood pressure effect(22). Recently, a note that COVID-19 can induce RAS imbalance
that drives acute lung injury(23). In vitro results showed that continued viral infection would
reduce membrane ACE2 expression, leading to unstoppable activation of RAS in the lungs,
which further induce local inflammation by recruited neutrophils after LPS stimuli(24). In
COVID-19, ACE2 showed opposite harmful effects as an entry point, and beneficial effect by
counteracting the overstimulated RAS as it degrades AngII to angiotensin 1-7 (Ang1-7) (25).
Interestingly Ang1-7 is shown to block high-fat diet-induced obesity, which increased ACE2
expression in adipose tissue(26). Therefore, our hypothesis was that induced obesity can
upregulate ACE2 in the lung in response to a high-fat diet, which makes the lung more
susceptible to viral entry but can regulate the overstimulated RAS. To examine that, we
explored publicly available transcriptomics data of where lungs were examined after inducing
obesity to look for the ACE2 expression changes. GSE38092 dataset was found with eight
regular weight mice versus eight diet-induced obese mice where their lungs were extracted for
microarray gene expression profiling(27), as shown in Figure 5C. Interestingly, lung Ace2
expression was significantly upregulated in obese mice compared to lean.
Sterol-response element binding proteins (SREBP) are transcription factors that have been
associated with lipogenesis, adipogenesis and cholesterol homeostasis to prevent lipotoxicity.
Studies have shown differential expression of SREBP-1 in regard to obesity. Figure 5 A and B
shows a decrease in Srebf1 and Srebf2, the genes that code for the different proteins, namely
SREBP-1 and SREBP-2.

diet in obese compared to regular weight mice extracted from publicly available transcriptomic
dataset GSE38092

The increased level of Ace2 in the lungs of obese mice led us to investigate which cell type in
the lung has the highest expression of Ace2. We explored LungGENS web-based tool that
can map single-cell gene expression in lung(28). Among all cells in the human lungs, Ace2
was expressed exclusively by epithelial cells, as shown in Figure 5.

Lung epithelial cells express lesser ACE2 during activated lipogenesis
The next question is how diet-induced obesity mechanistically can upregulate ACE2 in the
lung, to answer this question, another dataset (GSE31797) was explored where the dynamics
of lung lipotoxicity was examined by manipulating SREBP (29). SREBPs regulate the
expression of genes involved in lipid synthesis and function by their actions as transcription
factors(30). It was shown previously that the deletion of ACE2 in the liver and skeletal muscles
could induce lipogenesis by inducing SREBPs, indicating the role of the ACE2/Ang1-7 axis in
lipid metabolism (31, 32).
In this dataset, alveolar type 2 cell RNA from Insig1/2Δ/Δ (activated SREBP1 levels) and
Insig1flox/flox/Insig2−/− (suppressed SREBP1 levels) mice were profiled by microarray.
Interestingly, activating SREBP1, coded by Srebf1, downregulated the expression of the three
probes of the Ace2 gene used in the microarray, as shown in Figure 7. This data indicates that
Ace2 expression might be under the control of SREBP1.

Discussion
This study, which uses publicly available data, demonstrates that firstly, SARS-CoV-2
infection induces changes in lipid profile in healthy hosts as demonstrated in infection of
healthy epithelial cells. Secondly, this is important when obesity is at play as the lipid profile
is already disrupted which may lead to increased susceptibility to infection which if occurs will
further alter the lipid profile inducing hyper-inflammation.
We first demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 infection of healthy epithelial cells compared to
mock-infected cells clusters the genes involved in inflammatory, immune and viral responses
(Fig. 1). In particular, the IL-17 and IL-10 signalling pathways were heavily impacted.
Symptoms of severe COVID-19 have been associated with a cytokine storm with high levels
of IL-17, IL-10, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9 among many other pro-inflammatory cytokines
(14, 33). IL-17, with its many pro-inflammatory effects, has been suggested as a potential target
for the treatment of COVID-19. This is of interest as obesity is associated with high levels of
immune cells producing IL-17 (34). IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine with antiviral
properties, is usually downregulated in infections. However, severe cases of COVID-19 have
been associated with high levels of IL-10.
Obesity is a major health problem associated with increased risk of developing diabetes,
hypercholesteremia and hypertension. Alterations in the metabolic pathways are seen such as
increases in leptin and insulin secretion and decrease in adiponectin. Leptin stimulates fatty
acid oxidation and may lead to lipotoxicity through decreased lipid accumulation in nonadipose tissue. As metabolic regulation and immune responses seem to be integrated with the
function of one being dependent on the other, obesity is associated with high levels of proinflammatory mediators (35). Therefore, we focused our study on metabolic pathways in
conjunction with inflammatory pathways. Our data revealed that among the pathways that were
differentially expressed were the regulation of glucose metabolic process and regulation of fat
cell differentiation (Fig. 2). Firstly, we found that PTPRQ and EGR2 genes were significantly
downregulated in SARS-CoV-2 infected healthy epithelial cells. Although they have been
described to have roles in lipogenesis, their exact role in viral infection remains unknown and
warrants further investigation.
The upregulation of LEPR and LEP and associated SOC3 in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection
was in line with mechansims which are dysregulated in the state of obesity. This finding is of
interest as it has been previously shown that viruses such as the West Nile Virus hijack cellular

cholesterol to redistribute it and allow completion of its replication cycle (36, 37). Previous
studies have shown that obesity is associated with leptin resistance and increased blood levels
of leptin with concomitant increases in SOC3 which plays a role in inhibiting signal
transduction of leptin and other cytokines (38).
Having established that SARS-CoV-2 infection and obesity share common pathways
associated with dysregulation of lipid metabolism, we were interested to see if obesity, which
has been described as a risk factor of COVID-19, is associated with higher susceptibility to
infection. SARS-CoV-2 uses the ACE2 as a receptor for viral entry so we hypothesized that
obesity may lead to higher expression of ACE2. Using a high-fat diet animal model of obesity,
our results revealed a higher expression of Ace2 among diet-induced obese mice compared to
lean mice. The data also suggests that the expression of ACE2 is exclusive to lung epithelial
cells. Previous studies with SARS-CoV have shown that infection state correlates with state of
cell differentiation and expression of ACE2 (39).
The present study focused on the relationship between ACE2 expression and dysregulation of
lipid metabolism. Therefore, we were interested to see how dysregulation of lipid metabolism
could affect ACE2 expression. SREBPs are a family of transcription factors which control lipid
synthesis and adipogenesis by controlling enzymes required for cholesterol, fatty acid,
triacylglycerol and phospholipid synthesis. In cholesterol deprivation, they translocate from
the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus where they are then targeted to the nucleus
following cleavage. In the nucleus, they proceed to induce the expression of fatty acid and
sterol synthesis (40). SREBP family is composed of SREBP-1 and SREBP-2. SREBP-1 exists
as two isoforms: SREBP1-a and SREBP1-c. These isoforms are controlled by independent
regulatory proteins and appear to respond differently to different states of lipid factors. Our
study suggests that suppressing SREBP1 leads to upregulation of ACE2 expression.
In summary, our findings from the publicly available transcriptomic data show that SARSCoV-2 infection has significant effects on pathways involved in lipid metabolism. This is of
importance as dysregulation of lipid metabolism is a feature of obesity, one of the risk factors
of COVID-19. More importantly our data reveal that this increased susceptibility may be due
to an increase in ACE2 expression in the lung which is regulated by SREBP1. These findings
may potentially aide us in understanding the increased susceptibility in relation to other risk
factors such as diabetes and hypercholesteremia.
