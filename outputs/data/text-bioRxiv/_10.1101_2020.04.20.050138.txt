Abstract
We dissect the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 in human lung host from the initial phase of
receptor binding to viral replication machinery. We constructed two independent lung
protein interactome to reveal the signaling process on receptor activation and host
protein hijacking machinery in the pathogenesis of virus. Further, we test the functional
role of the hubs derived from both interactome. Most hubs proteins were differentially
regulated on SARS-CoV-2 infection. Also, the proteins of viral replication hubs were
related with cardiovascular disease, diabetes and hypertension confirming the
vulnerability and severity of infection in the risk individual. Additionally, the hub proteins
were closely linked with other viral infection, including MERS and HCoVs which suggest
similar

Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2) became a pandemic, spread
almost 150 countries worldwide [1]. SARS-CoV-2 causes lower respiratory infections
leading to pneumonitis and multi-organ failure [2]. Till date, 1991562 cases were
reported as on 16th April 2020 and expected to increase every day by a human-tohuman transmission that occurred due to close contact with one another [3]. An
increase in patient number increases the fatality rate because of non-specific treatment
against SARS-CoV-2. Today COVID-19 became a serious threat in both developed and
under-developing countries [4]. There is an urgent need to accelerate work on specific
treatments to decrease disease, morbidity and mortality [5, 6]. Repurposing of existing
drugs has been considered as an immediate remedy rather than waiting for a new
molecule to pass through human clinical trials. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 screening at

the early stage may benefit the vulnerable population with the risk factor of diabetes,
hypertension [7-9], and cardiovascular disease [10]. However, understanding the
mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 and host involvement will provide knowledge that guides
towards developing biomarkers and drugs to treat this pandemic disease.

SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded RNA virus-derived from the Human SARSCoV-2 group of ß-genus with the genome size of 30kbp. SARS-CoV-2 genome encodes
most structural proteins at 3' ORFs and non-structural proteins (nsp) at 5' end ORFs [8,
11]. The nsp proteins are categorized as nsp1-16, which plays a potential role in
replicase / transcriptase activity whereas the ORFs at 3' encode nine putative accessory
factors along with four structural proteins, nucleocapsid (N), envelope (E), membrane
(M), and spike (S) proteins [8, 11]. The envelope (E), membrane (M), and spike (S)
proteins localized at vial surface suggested having host binding capacity. On host
attachment, SARS-CoV-2 initiates the infectious cycle and undergoes RNA replication
inside the host and assembles their substrate into their progeny virus. In general at the
initial phase of the host binding, virus may create an optimal environment for its
replication by interacting with the host proteins. Simultaneously, the host alters its gene
expression to react against the virus for self-defense leading to the overexpression of
inflammatory genes and cytokine storm [12]. Due to the viral genome complexity and
20% sequence dissimilarity with other pathogenic HCoVs [13]. Notably, the sequence
variations at replicase complex (ORF1ab), envelope (E), spike (S), nucleocapsid (N)
and membrane (M) suggest the possibility of different mechanisms adopted by SARSCoV-2 that brings the question of repurposing the existing drugs. The current
knowledge of host molecular components utilization by the SARS-CoV-2 is still at an
early stage compared with other known human infecting RNA viruses. Understanding
the regulatory behavior will enhance our knowledge of the virus-host mechanism, which
may through light on diagnosis and treatment.
In this study, we first time report a systems biological framework (Fig 1) to
investigate the molecular interplay between SARS-CoV2 and human lung tissue. The
novel approach uses high through-put experimental data and human protein

interactome to reveal the SARS-CoV2 driven host mechanism. Our approach provides
(i) Functional hubs that activated upon viral attachment to the receptor and viral genome
evasion to the host. (ii) Association of viral modulated functional hubs with diabetes,
hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. (iii) An interdependency between the
functional hubs that demonstrates the utilization of a host environment created upon
receptor activation for the viral replication process. (iv) Hubs representing miRNA for
therapeutic intervention. Overall, our framework accesses the information such as
human tissue proteome, transcriptome, text mining, and miRNA data to postulate a
mechanism in host on SARS-CoV2 infection.

Results
SARS CoV-2 Interacting host proteins
Firstly, we analyzed whether SARS CoV-2 protein interacting with the
endogenous human proteins (host). For which we searched and collected SARS-Cov-2
host proteomics data derived from affinity purification mass spectrometry [14]. The data
provide 332 human endogenous proteins interacting with 27 SARS CoV-2 proteins.
Further, these human endogenous proteins were categorized as SET-A and SET-B,
respectively. SET-A composed of 38 human proteins showing physical affinity with
structural proteins like as envelope (E), spike (S), and membrane (M) proteins localized
at SARS-CoV2 surface. Whereas, the SET-B contains 294 host proteins confirming its
affinity with 23 SARS-CoV2 non-structural and one nucleocapsid (N) proteins. Then, we
investigate host proteins that favor the attachment of SARS-CoV2. So, the cellular
localization of SET-A proteins was annotated to have ATP6V1A, AP3B1, STOM, and
ZDHHC5, localized at the host cell surface that may enable SARS-CoV2 attachment.
Further, the proteins in the SET-A and B were mapped with an in-house lung-expressed
gene database to confirm their expression in the lungs that relate the mechanism that
occurs in lung tissue.
Lung Protein-Protein Interactions

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.20.050138; this version posted April 23, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

Next, we investigate the high-through-put protein-protein interaction networks
that reveal the SARS-CoV2 mechanism in the host. Two independent protein
interactome networks were generated from SET-A and SET-B, respectively. The first
interactome, receptor-mediated network from SET-A contains four cell surface seed
proteins that extended to have 45 neighboring proteins with every node directly
connected to its seed proteins. The receptor-mediated network describes the molecular
signaling initiated on SARS-CoV2 attach to the host. Secondly, the viral replication
machinery network from SET-B with 332 seed proteins extended to 1486 neighboring
proteins with 11438 interacting edges which representing the mechanism attributed to
evasion of the SARS-CoV2 genome into the host. The proteins involved in the networks
were mapped to the in-house lung-expressed-gene database. As a result, all 49
proteins with four seed in the receptor-mediated network were expressed in the lungs
(Fig 2). Similarly, the viral replication machinery network was acquired with 1522
proteins with 9747 interacting edges showing the complex SARS-CoV-2 mechanism in
the human lungs.
Core regulatory hubs
Here, we looked for densely connected protein, which provides essential
functional hubs within the network. Molecular complex detection (MCODE) algorithm
[15] used to extract hubs that define the core regulatory signaling and cellular processes
within the network. Eleven core functional hubs were obtained from the viral replication
machinery network (S1-11 Fig). In a receptor-mediated network, the implementation of
the MCODE algorithm was exempted for its limited number of nodes and edges, which
by itself forms hubs. Hence, the interacting proteins for all four distinct receptors were
considered as hubs for the receptor-mediated network (Fig 2). All hub proteins were
mapped to differential expressed genes from RNA-Seq data. Of 374 hub proteins from
both the network, 76 were differentially regulated in primary human lung epithelium
(NHBE) on SARS-CoV2 infection (RNA-Seq dataset GSE147507). For instance, eight
differentially expressed hub proteins were noticed in the receptor-mediated network (S1
Table). Similarly, among 325 hub proteins of viral replication machinery network, 68

were altered significantly, which confirms the hijacking of endogenous human proteins
for the viral replication process (S1 Table).
Data Mining and Molecular risk factor Association
Next, we investigated why SARS-CoV2 infection is susceptible to metabolic
diseases like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and hypertension. For that, we tested
the associations of hub proteins with these metabolic diseases using natural language
processing in our indigenous R-code. Among 374 hub proteins from the network, 186,
155, and 103 proteins were associated with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and
hypertension, respectively (S2 Table). We adopted a similar mining process to
determine the relevance of hub proteins with lung diseases such as asthma, chronic
bronchitis,

pneumonia,

chronic

obstructive

pulmonary

disease

(COPD),

and

emphysema. Simultaneously, the relevance of hub proteins was tested in viral infections
such as adenovirus, influenza, metapneumo, parainfluenza, respiratory syntical virus,
rhinovirus, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, HCoV- HKU1, HCoV-OC43, SARS-CoV and
MERS-CoV. These results suggest that 101 hub proteins have relevance to lung
disease (S3 Table), and 117 proteins were associated with the known viral infection (S4
Table). These associating hubs convey the likelihood of vulnerability in the risk
population, symptoms related to lung diseases, and similar modes of viral infection.
Molecular Enrichment
Subsequently, the protein enrichment analysis was executed to check the
molecular involvement of hubs on SARS-CoV2 infection. The enrichment analysis of
hubs showed several over representing pathways for the hubs of receptor-mediated
(Fig 3) and viral replication machinery network (Fig 4). The receptor-mediated network
hubs exhibit several molecular signaling and cellular events upon SARS-CoV2
attachment (S5 Table). Notably, most hub proteins showed significant association with
immune mechanism, signal transduction, metabolism of proteins, metabolism of RNA,
transcription machinery, vesicle-mediated transport, metabolism, transport of small
molecules cell cycle and homeostasis were noticed (S5 Table). Also, a moderate
involvement was seen in cellular response mechanism, cell-cell communication,

organelle biogenesis and maintenance. Similarly, the enrichment analysis of hubs
derived from viral replication machinery network (Fig 4) showed a major involvement of
immune mechanism, signal transduction, metabolism of proteins, metabolism of RNA,
transcription machinery, DNA repair, DNA replication, programmed cell death, and
cellular responses to external stimuli were noticed (Table S5). Interestingly, several
common mechanisms were noticed that occur due to the existence of 34 interconnected
proteins between the hubs of both the network (Fig 5-9). These common molecules
represent the inter-connecting mechanism involved in the transcription machinery,
immune response, cell growth and/or maintenance, transport, metabolism, protein
metabolism, cell communication and signal transduction that activated upon virus
binding and has been subsequently utilized for viral replication process (S5 Table) (Fig
10).
miRomics Interdependency
We further investigate these 34 interconnecting proteins that may use for a
therapeutic process. For which, the miRNA target for interconnecting proteins (genes)
was identified. Among 34 proteins, 26 shown targeted by 119 miRNA. Of which, miR124-3p, let-7g-5p, miR-133a-3p, miR-133b, miR-218-5p, miR-22-3p and miR-506-3p
were noticed to target more than three interconnected proteins (Fig 11). These miRNAs
may show its utility for therapeutic intervention.

Discussion
We implement a comprehensive systems biological framework (Fig.1) that
utilizes a variety of datasets to illustrate the critical mechanism mediated by SARSCoV2 in the lungs. Two independent lung proteins interactome were constructed. The
first interactome termed as a receptor-mediated network that revealed the molecular
interaction that mediates cellular and signaling processes on SARS-CoV2 attachment to
the host. In the receptor-mediated network, ATP6V1A, AP3B1, STOM, and ZDHHC5
are the seed proteins localized at the host surface showed significant affinity to the
outer surface envelope (E), spike (S), and membrane (M) proteins of SARS-CoV2. On
bounding with ATP6V1A, AP3B1, STOM, and ZDHHC5, the host activates multiple

signaling and cellular events that demonstrated in the receptor-mediated protein
network (Fig 3). For instance, viral envelope (E) bound to the AP3B1 cell-surface
protein that initiates the interaction with its neighboring proteins, AP1G1, AP1M1,
AP3D1, AP3M2, AP3S1, AP3S2, ARF1, ARF6, ARRB1, ARRB2, BUB1, BUB1B, CLTC,
and CSNK1A1. Similarly, spike (S) interacts with the ZDHHC5 that connects CLDND1,
FLOT2, FXYD1, FYN, LRRC8A, and PIF1. Likewise, the SARS-CoV2 membrane (M)
interacts with ATP6V1A and STOM host surface protein that signals 25 human
endogenous proteins (Fig 2). Each host cell surface proteins and it's interacting
neighbors form a closed hub with no extensive interconnection with another hub. These
hubs were pathways enriched that takes part in wide verities of molecular pathways that
include endosome transport, vesicle-mediated transport, protein modification, regulation
of cell cycle, immune response, kinase activity, signal transduction, protein metabolism,
cell communication, energy and metabolic pathway, cell growth, and maintenance,
regulation of nucleic acid metabolism. To our knowledge, most of this mechanism is
very well connected with the viral pathogenesis machinery mechanism. Notably, at an
early phase of surface attachment, the host initiates inflammatory signaling such as
interleukin signaling (IL1, IL2, IL5, IL23, IL8), TNF receptor, and NF-kappa B signaling
pathways that may initiate cytokine storm in lung cells [12, 16]. Simultaneously, the
involvement of transcription and translational regulatory processes were noticed in the
pathway enrichment of receptor hubs. These results suggest that on surface receptor
activation host prepares an optimal environment in the host for the viral replication. The
second lung protein interactome was named as viral replication machinery network. In
this network, we demonstrated the complex interconnectivity of human endogenous
proteome with nucleocapsid (N) and 23 non-structural SARS-CoV2 proteins. The viral
replication machinery network conveys the utilization of host factors for SARS-CoV2
replication and self-defense mechanism. Using the MCODE algorithm, eleven hubs (S111Fig) were extracted from the viral replication machinery networks, which play a
significant role in cellular and molecular mechanisms (S5 Table). Further, mapping the
differently expressed genes with the hubs showed approximately 20% of hub proteins
were altered upon SARS-CoV2 infection (S1 Table). This result confirms the hijack of
host hub proteins and their molecular pathways for SARS-CoV2 machinery. Some hub

proteins were proven linked to diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease (S2
Table). These results suggest that the SARS-Cov-2 alter and utilize the disease
proteins for its replication machinery that may be the considerable cause for
susceptibility, severity, and complication. Besides, similar observations were noticed
while mapping hub proteins with proteins related to lung disease and other viral
infections. On mapping, 101 hub proteins were shared between the lung diseases
suggesting a common mechanism relating disease symptoms and/or vulnerability (S3
Table). Also mapping with other viral infection dataset, 50 hub proteins of the replication
machinery network have noticed in influenza virus infection (S4 Table), which suggests
SARS-CoV2 and influenza may have a similar mode of host infection machinery [17].

As apart, several common pathways between the hubs of two networks were
noticed (S5 Table). We obtained these common pathways as an intersection of the 34
interacting molecules between the hubs (Fig 5-9). For example, AP3B1 hub derived
from the receptor-mediated network interact with the “hub 4” of viral replication
machinery network by GTF2F2, POLR2E, ARRB1, and AP3B1 interconnecting proteins
(Fig 5). Overall, five interacting hubs were noticed between receptor-mediated and viral
replication machinery network (Fig 5-9). The molecular pathways of interconnecting
protein hubs could be the intermediate phase that connects the receptor activation
mechanism and viral replication process (Fig 10). Such intersecting proteins will aid in
developing a drug for SARS-CoV2.

Here, we suggest a few miRNAs that regulates the proteins of
interconnecting hubs, which may have therapeutic potential. The miRNA has been
regarded as drug molecules for various diseases [18 19]. Of 111 miRNA, miR-124-3p,
let-7g-5p, miR-133a-3p, miR-133b, miR-218-5p, miR-22-3p and miR-506-3p targets
minimum of three interconnecting proteins (Fig 11). These seven miRNA molecules are
needed to be viewed in a better perspective for future research to screen and treat the
current SARS-CoV2 pandemic. Overall, this study displays several advancement and
advantages, 1) Establishes interplay between SARS-CoV2 and human lung host
mechanism by integrating experimental evidence arrived from high throughput multi-

omics observation on SARS-CoV2. 2) Our approach provides a possible clue for
susceptibility and severity in an individual with metabolic disease complications and
suggests possible proteomic relevance with lung diseases and other viral infections. 3)
Our study increases knowledge of molecular interconnectivity between receptor binding
mechanism and viral replication machinery that guide towards drug target research.
Although our approach provides the multi-dimensional view on SARS-CoV2 and host
interaction, two major limitations need to be considered, 1) the interaction between
SARS-CoV2 spike protein with the host angiotensin (ACE2) receptor is not defined in
affinity purification mass spectrometry data. Hence, no direct ACE2 interaction has been
established in our interactome. 2) We propose a few miRNAs from our approach, are
needed to be validated further for clinical application.

Conclusion
In summary, our systems biological approach provides an extensive investigation
on SARS-CoV2 host interaction by constructing interactome based on experimental
evidence. We identified crucial functional hubs that relate the mechanism on activation
SARS-CoV2 attachment through receptor and subsequent utilization functional hubs for
viral replication in the host. Enrichment analysis supports our hypothesis showed the
common mechanism associated with transcriptional and protein translation processing
activated upon in host attachment. Hub proteins showed linked with diabetes,
hypertension, and cardiovascular disease proteins that provide the clue for severity and
susceptibility in the diseased population. The relationship between hub proteins with
lung diseases like COPD, asthma, pneumonia establishes the likelihood of similar
symptoms. Also, assessing the hubs with the reported proteins of other viral infection
establishes the similarity in the mode of viral infection. Interestingly, we propose miR124-3p, let-7g-5p, miR-133a-3p, miR-133b, miR-218-5p, miR-22-3p, and miR-506-3p
from the genes of interconnecting proteins from its molecular pathways as a miRNA
drug for SARS-CoV2. However, further work is needed to confirm its utility for clinical
application. We believe our results will add knowledge to the existing information that
may open up miRNA as a drug for SARS-CoV2 infection.

Methods
SARS CoV-2 Interacting host proteins
The dataset relating severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV2) and human proteins interactions searched electronically. Of extensive search,
the experimentally proven dataset reporting the physical association of 26 SARS-CoV2
proteins with human proteins determined using affinity purification mass spectrometry
(AP-MS) [14] was retrieved. We converted all collected interacting human proteins to an
official gene/protein symbol using the Uniport database (https://www.uniprot.org/).
Further, the interacting proteins were categorized into SET-A and SET-B. The SET-A
contains Human proteins that interact with SARS-CoV2 structural proteins, especially
envelope (E), spike (S), and membrane (M) whereas SET-B contains Human proteins
that interact with nucleocapsid (N) and 22 non-structural proteins. The SET-A was
further curated to have proteins localized at plasma membrane using Cell surface
protein atlas (https://wlab.ethz.ch/cspa/), Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD)

(https://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact/) database. All collected interactions were mapped to
the lung-expressed-gene database to construct human lung protein-protein interactome.
Each protein interaction in SET-A and SET-B was considered if both the interacting
proteins neighbors were expressed in lung tissue. Thereafter, SET-A was designated as
a receptor-mediated network and SET-B was termed as a viral replication machinery
network.
Core regulatory hubs
MCODE algorithm [15] was executed on the viral replication machinery network
to decompose the large network into dense functional hubs with a minimum of three
proteins in each hub. The derived functional hubs from the viral replication machinery
network describe the core functional module of host influenced by the non-structural
proteins of SARS-CoV2. Whereas in the receptor-mediated network, implementing
MCODE algorithm was exempted because of its limited number of nodes and edges,
which by itself forms hubs. The functional hubs of the receptor-mediated network exhibit
the mechanism that activated upon SARS-CoV2 attachment to the lung surface
proteins. Subsequently, in order to determine the involvement of each hub in viral
pathogenesis, the expression data of SARS-CoV2 infection was analyzed, and the
differential expressed genes were mapped hub proteins.
Mapping the Differential Genes
We searched the gene expression dataset in NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus
GEO (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) using various key terms related to SARS-CoV2.
Our search showed the availability of RNA-Seq dataset (GSE147507) executed in

were retried from NCBI, SRA database. After quality assessment, the reads were
aligned to the human genome (hg19) following the RNA-Seq analysis pipeline to
determine the differential expression genes using DESeq with p-value < 0.05. Further,

the significant differentially expressed genes in the host on SARS-CoV2 infection were
collected and mapped to the hubs.
Data Mining and Molecular risk factor Association
R-program was employed to find out the associated genetic hubs risk factors
genes reported in the literature for diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases.
In brief, the R-code collects the abstract from the NCBI, PUBMED, for the keywords
related to each risk factor. All abstracts were automatically examined for the presence
of risk factors (examples: “diabetes”) and hub proteins using a natural language
processing method. Further, the co-occurrence of risk factors with each protein symbol
in the abstract was assessed using a point-wise mutual information method. A similar
data mining process was carried out for lung diseases (asthma, chronic bronchitis,
pneumonia, and emphysema) and other viral pathogens such as adenovirus, influenza,
metapneumo, parainfluenza, respiratory syntical virus, rhinovirus, HCoV-NL63, HCoV229E, HCoV- HKU1, HCoV-OC43, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Molecular Enrichment
Simultaneously, all hubs were enriched using Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
Genomes (Reactome; https://reactome.org//) database to evaluate the relevance of the
pathway of each hub in SARS-CoV2 infection and replication process. In particular, the
pathway enrichment of receptor-mediated network hubs shows the mechanism initiated
upon SARS-CoV2 receptor activation. Whereas, the pathways of viral replication
machinery network hubs explain the mechanism attribute on evasion of SARS-CoV2
genome into the host for its replication process.
miRomics Interdependency
miRomics enrichment analysis was performed for the selected genes in hubs
considering the importance of miRNA in treatment. The relevant information genemiRNA target was collected from the electronic database miRTarBase Version 7.0
