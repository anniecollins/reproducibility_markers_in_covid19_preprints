Abstract：
Emerging and re-emerging RNA viruses occasionally cause epidemics and pandemics
worldwide, such as the on-going outbreak of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Existing
direct-acting antiviral (DAA) drugs cannot be applied immediately to new viruses
because of virus-specificity, and the development of new DAA drugs from the
beginning is not timely for outbreaks. Thus, host-targeting antiviral (HTA) drugs have
many advantages to fight against a broad spectrum of viruses, by blocking the viral
replication and overcoming the potential viral mutagenesis simultaneously. Herein, we
identified two potent inhibitors of DHODH, S312 and S416, with favorable drug-like
and pharmacokinetic profiles, which all showed broad-spectrum antiviral effects
against various RNA viruses, including influenza A virus (H1N1, H3N2, H9N2), Zika
virus, Ebola virus, and particularly against the recent novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
Our results are the first to validate that DHODH is an attractive host target through high
antiviral efficacy in vivo and low virus replication in DHODH knocking-out cells. We
also proposed the drug combination of DAA and HTA was a promising strategy for
anti-virus treatment and proved that S312 showed more advantageous than Oseltamivir
to treat advanced influenza diseases in severely infected animals. Notably, S416 is
reported to be the most potent inhibitor with an EC50 of 17nM and SI value >5882 in
SARS-CoV-2-infected cells so far. This work demonstrates that both our self-designed
candidates and old drugs (Leflunomide/Teriflunomide) with dual actions of antiviral
and immuno-repression may have clinical potentials not only to influenza but also to
COVID-19 circulating worldwide, no matter such viruses mutate or not.

Introduction：
Acute viral infections, such as influenza virus, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, Ebola virus,
Zika virus, and the very recent SARS-CoV-2 are an increasing and probably lasting
global threat1. Broad-spectrum antivirals (BSA) are clinically needed for the effective
control of emerging and re-emerging viral infectious diseases. However, although great
efforts have been made by the research community to discover therapeutic antiviral
agents for coping with such emergencies, specific and effective drugs or vaccines with
low toxicity have been rarely reported2. Thus, unfortunately, there is still no effective
drugs for the infection of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 at present, which
outbreak in December 2019 firstly identified by several Chinese groups3-5, and now has
quickly spread throughout China and to more than 90 other countries, infecting 101,923
patients and killing 3486 ones by March 7, 20206.
Discovery of nucleoside or nucleotide analogs and host-targeting antivirals (HTAs)
are two main strategies for developing BSA7-9. With the former drug class usually
causing drug resistance and toxicity, the discovery of HTAs has attracted much
attention10. Several independent studies searching for HTAs collectively end up to
compounds targeting the host's pyrimidine synthesis pathway to inhibit virus infections,
which indicates that the replication of viruses is widely dependent on the host
pyrimidine synthesis11-25. However, most of these compounds lack verified drug targets
making subsequent drug optimization and further application impossible11,13-15,17-19,21,25.
There are only a few inhibitors against pyrimidine synthesis that can be carried forward
to animal studies, however, their antiviral efficacies were unsatisfactory or even
ineffective at all12,16,17,21,23-25. For example, a pyrimidine synthesis inhibitor FA-613
without a specific target protected only 30.7% of mice from lethal influenza A virus
infection when compared to the DAA drug Zanamivir (100%) in parallel23. Another two
compounds, Cmp124 and FK77825, which target DHODH, a rate-limiting enzyme in the
fourth step of the de novo pyrimidine synthesis pathway, could only inhibit the DNA
virus (CMV) replication in RAG-/- mice, but their therapeutic effects on the upcoming
diseases were unexplored. Therefore, more potent pyrimidine synthesis inhibitors,
especially ones with the specific drug target, are urgent to be developed to prove

whether such an HTA drug is valuable towards clinical use or has any advantages over
DAA drugs in antiviral treatment.
To identify potent and low-toxicity DHODH inhibitors (DHODHi), we previously
conducted a hierarchal structure-based virtual screening (Fig. 1A) against ~280,000
compounds library towards the ubiquinone-binding site of DHODH26. We finally
obtained two highly potent DHODHi S312 and S416 with IC50s of 29.2 nM and 7.5 nM
through structural optimization27,28, which are > 10-folds potent than the FDA approved
DHODHi Teriflunomide (IC50 of 307.1 nM). By using these two potent inhibitors, we
could fully evaluate DHODH as a valuable host target both in infected cells and in vivo
in infected animals. We identified that targeting DHODH offers broad-spectrum
antiviral efficacies against various RNA viruses, including the DAA-resistant influenza
virus and the newly emerged coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Especially, our potent
DHODHi can protect 100% mice from lethal influenza challenge, which is as good as
the DAA drugs, and is even effective in the late phase of infection when DAA drug is
no longer responding.

Results:
The discovery of potent DHODH inhibitors with low toxicity in vivo and high
antiviral efficacies in influenza-A-virus infected cells.
By determination of the X-ray crystal structure of DHODH in complex with S416
(Supplementary Data Fig. 1A, Table S1), we verified the binding mode of S416 at
the ubiquinone-binding site of DHODH that similar to S312. The binding free energies
for S312 and S416 were -45.06 and -46.74 kJ/mol, and the binding equilibrium
dissociation constants (KD) were 20.3 and 1.69 nM, respectively (Fig. 1B and 1C).
Additionally, the two inhibitors exhibited a clear trait of fast-associating (kon) and slowdissociating (koff) inhibition (Table S2), providing themselves as ideal drug candidates
with a high level of target occupancy. Moreover, S312 and S416 showed proper halflives (8.20 and 9.12 h, respectively) (Table S3), which are much shorter than that of
Teriflunomide and Leflunomide, indicating that they may have less possibility to bring
side effects from drug accumulation in the body (Supplementary Data Fig. 1B and
1C).
To examine the antiviral activities of these DHODHi, we use the influenza A virus
as a model virus. A labor stain of A/WSN/33(H1N1, WSN) with 20 TCID50 was applied
to infect MDCK cells, and serial dilutions of drugs (DMSO as controls) were added at
the same time when cells were infected. Drug efficacies were evaluated by
quantification of cell viability in both infected and non-infected cells, and the halfmaximal effective concentration (EC50) and the half-cytotoxic concentration (CC50) of
the indicated drug were obtained accordingly. The selectivity index (SI) was calculated
by CC50/EC50. As shown in Fig. 1D, the antiviral effect of Leflunomide is hardly
detectable at the cell culture level (EC50>25 μ M). However, Teriflunomide,
the active metabolite of Leflunomide, exhibited a clear antiviral effect against the WSN
virus (EC50=29.33μM, CC50=178.50μM，SI=6.08). As compared to Teriflunomide, the
potent DHODHi S312 is ~12-fold stronger (EC50=2.36μM) and S416 is ~480-fold
stronger (EC50=0.061μM) than Teriflunomide in their antiviral efficacies. We also
tested different influenza A virus subtypes of H3N2 and H9N2. The antiviral efficacies
of DHODHi followed the same pattern as they were against H1N1, which is

S416>S312>Teriflunomide>Leflunomide in viral inhibitory efficacies (summarized in
Table 1). The drug effective curve of S416 to H3N2 (EC50=0.013μM) and H9N2
(EC50=0.020μM) is shown in Fig. 1E and 1F. When we compared the drug efficacy by
virus plaque assay, the results in Fig. 1G showed that the positive control DAA drug
Oseltamivir (Osel) could reduce the plaque size to needlepoint size. However, the virus
plaque in equivalent S312-treatment was not observable at all indicating that S312 is
more efficient in inhibiting virus replication than Osel.
The results in all indicate that DHODHi, especially S312 and S416 exhibited direct
antiviral activities to different subtypes of influenza A viruses by shutting off virus
multiplication more thoroughly than Osel.
The broad-spectrum antiviral activities of DHODHi to Zika, Ebola and newly
emerged SARS-CoV-2 viruses in infected cells.
As all actuate infectious viruses rely on cellular pyrimidine synthesis process to
replicate, it is reasonable to speculate that DHODHi have broad-spectrum antiviral
efficacies. We, therefore, tested several highly impacted acute infectious RNA viruses.
All compounds of Teriflunomide, Brequinar, S312, and S416, showed inhibitory effects
against Ebola virus (EBOV) mini-replicon, with EC50 of 6.43, 0.102, 14.96 and
0.018μM, respectively (Fig. 2A). To our supersize, S416 showing relatively high
cytotoxicity in MDCK cells (CC50=1.64μM in Fig.1D) was less toxic to EBOV-minireplicon supporting BSR-T7/5 cells (CC50=85.84μM). Thus, a significantly high
SI=4746.11 was achieved by S416. We subsequently tested the inhibitory effects of
DHODHi against Zika virus (Fig. 2B). EC50 values were 17.72, 0.268, 2.29 and
0.021μM for Teriflunomide, Brequinar, S312 and S416, respectively. Again, the
selective index of S416 reached the top of SI=1087.62.
When we prepared the manuscript, a severe outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 occurred in
Wuhan in December 2019, we responded quickly to examine the antiviral activity of
DHODHi against this new coronavirus. The data in Fig. 2C showed that all the
DHODHi tested is low toxic to SARS-CoV-2 susceptible Vero E6 cells. Teriflunomide
had a solid antiviral efficacy of EC50=26.06uM (at MOI=0.05, ~2.4-fold stronger than

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.11.983056; this version posted March 12, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

Favipiravir [EC50=61.88μM]29) (Fig. 2C upper right), whereas its pro-drug
Leflunomide showed less inhibition of EC50=63.56uM (data not shown). We therefore
further did immuno-florescent assay to visualize the drug efficacy. To determine more
carefully the efficacy of Teriflunomide, which can be transferred to clinical treatment
of SARS-CoV-2 immediately as an approved drug, a bit low MOI of 0.03 (Fig. 2C
upper left) were applied. In this condition, the EC50 of Teriflunomide could reach 6μM
with SI>33, indicating that Teriflunomide with effective EC50 and SI values have all the
potentials to treat SARS-CoV-2-induced COVID-19 disease as an ’old drug in new use’
option.
Additionally, S312 and S416 exhibited ideal antiviral efficacies of EC50=1.55μM
(SI>64.62) and EC50=0.017μM (extensively high SI>5882.4), respectively (Fig. 2C
lower panel). Compared with our previous publication of Remdesivir (EC50=0.77μM,
SI>129.87) and Chloroquine (EC50=1.13μM, SI>88.5)29, which are currently used in
clinical trials against SARS-CoV-2, S416 had much greater EC50 and SI values (66.5fold stronger than Chloroquine in EC50) against SARS-CoV-2. The data in Fig. 2D
clearly showed that as little as 4.6nM (0.3EC50) of S416 can dramatically inhibit SARSCoV-2 infections, while, increased drug concentration of 370nM (22EC50) could further
eliminate viral infected cells. Thus, S416 turns to be the best efficient chemical so far
against SARS-CoV-2 at the cellular level.

S312 exhibited equivalent antiviral activities to Oseltamivir in influenza-A-virusinfected animals.
In all the previous studies, inhibitors to DHODH or pyrimidine synthesis pathway were
only active in vivo at low efficacy showing no obvious superior to DAA drugs. To test
whether our potent DHODHi could refresh the important role of targeting DHODH in
viral disease, we next explored in vivo efficacy of S312 by intranasally infecting
BALB/c mice at a lethal dose of WSN (2LD50=4000pfu) or 2009 pandemic H1N1
(A/Sichuan/01/2009, SC09) (300pfu) virus. Treatment of S312 or Osel or combined
treatment of ‘S312+Osel’ was given by the intraperitoneal (i.p.) route at 4h p.i. once
per day from the beginning of infection to Day 14 to determine body weight changes

and mortality (experimental procedure shown in Fig. 3A). The data in Fig. 3B showed
that the bodyweights of mice from the DMSO-treated ‘virus group’ all dropped to less
than 75% and died at D8 p.i.. DAA drug of Osel could indeed totally rescue all the mice
from bodyweight loss and death. Equivalently, S312 (5mg/kg, red line) was also able
to confer 100% protection and little bodyweight loss similar to Osel. Even S312 of
2.5mg/kg and 10mg/kg cold confer 75% protection and 50% protection, respectively.
Considering the Cmax of S312 (≈15μM), we used both 5mg/kg and 10mg/kg in the
following experiments. The results suggest that S312 of a modest dose (5mg/kg) would
achieve the equivalent 100% protection to DAA drug when used from the beginning of
infection.
Except for broad active to different viruses, HTA drug such as DHODHi has another
advantage over DAA drug to overcome drug-resistant. To prove this, we generated a
current-circulating Oseltamivir-resistant NAH275Y mutant virus (in WSN backbone) by
reverse genetics (Supplementary data Fig. 2A and 2B). We found that the NAH275Y
virus did not respond to Osel (20mg/kg/day)-treatment at all but 2.5mg/kg/day of S312
can rescue 50% of mice from lethal infection of NAH275Y virus (Supplementary data
Fig. 2C). When mice were infected with a natural-isolated pandemic strain SC09,
which is less sensitive to either Osel (40% protection) or S312 (20% protection) (Fig.
3C), we further observed 100% protection in combined treatment of S312+Osel,
indicating that HTA and DAA drug combination can augment therapeutic effects.
The data in all refresh DHODH as an attractive host target in treating viral disease
with equivalent efficacy to DAA drug, and is advantageous when facing DAA-drugresistant viruses.

DHODHi inhibit virus replication through interrupting the de novo pyrimidine
synthesis pathway.
To elucidate the essential role of DHODH in the viral replication cycle, we generated a
DHODH-/- A549 cell line by CRISPR-Cas9 gene knock-off (KO) technology (Fig. 4A).
Unexpectedly, the cell proliferation rate was barely affected in DHODH-/- cells
indicating DHODH is not indispensable for cell growth at least for three days (72 hours)

(Supplementary Fig. 3). By contrast, virus growth was largely inhibited in DHODH-/cells as compared to wild-type (WT) A549 cells with almost 1000-fold reduction of
infectious particles at 72 hours post-infection (h.p.i.) (Fig. 4B). When S312 (5IC50) was
added into the culture medium, dramatic reduction of virus growth only occurred in
WT cells but not in DHODH-/- cells (Fig. 4C and 4D). These results prove that virus
growth but not the coincident cell growth requires DHODH activity, and antiviral action
of S312 is implemented by targeting DHODH.
The general virus growth cycle includes virus entry, viral genome replication, and
virus release. To further validate virus genome replication is the major target of
DHODHi, we used the influenza-A-virus mini-replicon system to quantify viral
genome replication. Brequinar, another potent inhibitor of DHODH was included as a
positive control30, whereas, Osel targeting influenza NA protein served as a negative
control. The results in Fig.4E showed no inhibition on viral genome replication in the
Osel-treated group, but there were obvious inhibitions on viral genome replication in
both S312- and S416-treated groups as well as Brequinar-treated group in dosedependent manners. Almost 90% of viral genome replication was suppressed by 10IC50
of

of dihydroorotate (DHO) to produce orotic acid (ORO) and finally forms UTP and CTP，
we add four nucleotides (adenine nucleotide(A), guanine nucleotide(G), uracil
nucleotide(U), and cytosine nucleotide(C)), DHO, ORO respectively to mini-replicon
system to identify the target of S312 and S416. The results in Fig. 4F showed that the
addition of 50μM either U or C could effectively rescue viral genome replication in
S312- and S416-treated cells (as well as Brequinar-treated cells), whereas addition of
neither A nor G changed the inhibitory effects. Moreover, supplement of DHODH
substrate DHO cannot rescue viral genome replication (Fig. 4G), but a supplement of
DHODH product ORO can gradually reverse the inhibition effects of S312 and S416
(Fig. 4H). The results further confirm that compounds S312 and S416 inhibit viral
genome replication via targeting DHODH and interrupting the fourth step in de novo
pyrimidine synthesis.

S312 is advantageous over the DAA drug to treat advanced and late-phase disease
with decreasing cytokine/chemokine storm.
It is documented elsewhere that DAA drugs such as Osel is only completely effective
in the early phase of infection, optimally within 48 hours of symptom onset31. And till
now, there is no approved drug to treat advanced influenza disease at the late phase
specifically. We suppose that S312 could be effective in the middle or late phase of
disease because it targets a host pro-viral factor of DHODH not affected by viral
replication cycle. To test this, we compared the therapeutic windows of S312 and Osel
in early (D3-D7), middle & late (D5-D9)，severe late (D7-D11 or D6-D14) phases
(workflow shown in Fig. 5A). When drugs were given in the early phase, both Oseltreatment and ‘Osel+S312’-combination-treatment conferred 100% protection (Fig.
5B). When drugs were given at the middle & late phase (Fig. 5C), single Osel-treatment
wholly lost its antiviral effect with no surviving. However, S312-treatment could
provide 50% protection, and drug combination reached to 100% protection. When
drugs were given at severe late phase of disease that mice were starting dying (Fig. 5D),
neither single treatment of Osel nor S312 can rescue the mice from death but combined
treatment still conferred to 25% survival. To really show the advantage of S312 in
treating severe disease, we additionally treated the mice a bit early before dying around
80% of initial weights (D6-D14) with a more optimal dose of S312 (5mg/kg). The data
in Fig. 5E showed that S312 rescued 50% of mice from severe body-weight losses, and
combined treatment coffered additional 25% survival. These results once again
highlight that S312 has remarkable advantages over Osel to treat severe diseases at the
late phase, and its therapeutic effectiveness could even be improved when S312 was
combined with DAA drug.
It is known that severe acute infections including influenza and COVID-19 always
induce pathogenic immunity as cytokine/chemokine storms. Leflunomide and
Teriflunomide are already clinically used in autoimmune disease to inhibit pathogenic
cytokines and chemokines. We, therefore, suspect that DHODHi should also be anticytokine-storm in viral infectious disease. BALF from either Osel- or ‘S312+Osel’treated mice were collected at D14 in an independently repeated experiment with a

lower infection dose. A parallel body weights excluded differences in virus load
(Supplementary Fig. 4A). The data in Supplementary Fig. 4B showed that the
pathogenic inflammatory cytokines in ‘S312+Osel’-treated group was largely reduced
as compared to Osel-treated mouse in the levels of IL6, MCP-1, IL5,
KC/GRO(CXCL1), IL2, IFN-γ, IP-10, IL9, TNF-α, GM-CSF, EPO, IL12p70, MIP3α
and IL17A/F (listed in the order of reduce significance).
The results in all provide striking information that DHODH inhibitors are effective
in infected animals not only by inhibiting virus replication (Shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4)
but also by eliminating excessive cytokine/chemokine storm. Usage of DHODHi could
finally benefit to advanced disease in late infection.

Discussions:
Many different RNA viruses had caused epidemics and pandemics in the past 20 years,
from avian influenza virus (AIV) H5N1 in 1997, SARS-CoV in 2002, pandemic H1N1
in 2009, MERS-CoV in 2012, AIV H7N9 in 2013, Ebola virus in 2013, Zika virus in
2016, to SARS-CoV-2 in 2019. Many of them are still prevalent in certain countries
and SARS-CoV-2 continues causing huge damage to China and worldwide. The
conventional one-bug-one-drug paradigm is insufficient to deal with the challenges of
these emerging and re-emerging pathogenic viruses32, moreover, it is too late to develop
drugs against each virus behind epidemics33. Thus, it is imperative to develop new ideas,
highly effective, broad-spectrum antiviral agents that can treat various viral infections.
In this study, we applied DHODH inhibitors including a computer-aided designed
compound S312 into viral infectious disease. We found that direct-targeting DHODHi
are broad-spectrum antiviral both in cell culture and in vivo. The candidate S312 had
further advantage to be used in infected animals with low toxicity and high efficiency.
Moreover, S312 can rescue severe influenza infection by limiting inflammatory
cytokine storm in vivo.
DHODH is a rate-limiting enzyme catalyzing the fourth step in pyrimidine de novo
synthesis. It catalyzes the dehydrogenation of dihydroorotate (DHO) to orotic acid
(ORO) to finally generate Uridine (U) and Cytosine (C) to supply nucleotide resources
in a cell. Under normal conditions, nucleotides are supplied via both de novo
biosynthesis and salvage pathways, the latter of which is a way of recycling pre-existing
nucleotides from food or other nutrition. However, in virus-infected cells, a large
intracellular nucleotide pool is demanded by rapid viral replication. It is therefore
reasonable that de novo nucleotides biosynthesis rather than salvage pathway is more
critical for virus replication. Our data indeed show that virus replication is largely
restricted when the DHODH gene was knocked off even with a complete culture
medium. By contrast, cell growth was not affected by lacking DHODH at all, indicating
that de novo nucleotides biosynthesis is not indispensable in normal cell growth without
infection at least for days. More interestingly, we notice that compared with DNA
viruses, RNA viruses need unique UMP but not TMP in their genomes. UMP is the

particular nucleoside produced by DHODH, which means RNA viruses might be more
sensitive to DHODH activity. SARS-CoV-2, for instance, has around 32% of UMP in
its genome explaining why DHODHi are effective and superior to SARS-CoV-2.
Nevertheless, the comparison between different viruses is worth to be studied in the
future.
Although several DHODHi have been documented to be antiviral by high-throughput
screening34-37. Most of these compounds are still at cell culture level with unknown in
vivo efficacy. Therefore, the development of broad-spectrum antiviral agents targeting
DHODH is still an exciting avenue in antiviral research. S312 and S416 present more
potent inhibition and favorable pharmacokinetic profiles, moreover, the half-lives of
S312 and S416 (8.20 and 9.12 h, respectively) are much shorter and more appropriate
than that of Teriflunomide, indicating that they may have less possibility to bring toxic
side effects from drug accumulation in the body. Strikingly, S312 showed active effects
in vivo in lethal dose infection of influenza A viruses not only when used from the
beginning of infection but also in the late phase when DAA drug is not responding
anymore. Another surprise is the high SI value of S416 to against Zika (SI=1087.62),
Ebola (SI=4746.11), and the current SARS-CoV-2 (SI>5882). These data interpreted
that S416 is highly promising to develop further as it should be to S312. The extremely
high SI of S416 may be due to its high binding affinity and favorable occupation of the
ubiquinone-binding site of DHODH with faster-associating characteristics (kon =
1.76×106 M-1s-1) and slower dissociating binding characteristic (koff=2.97×10-3 s-1), which

will reduce the possibility of off-target in vivo.
Acute viral infections usually cause severe complications associated with hyper
induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which is also known as “cytokine storm”
firstly named in severe influenza disease38,39. Several studies showed that lethal SARS
patients expressed high serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-1, IL-6,
IL-12, and TGFβ) and chemokines (CCL2, CXCL10, CXCL9, and IL-8) compared to
uncomplicated SARS patients40-43. Similarly, in severe COVID-19 cases, ICU patients
had higher plasma levels of IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, GSCF, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNFα
compared to non-ICU patients44. Moreover, A clinical study of 123 patients with

COVID-19 showed that the percentage of patients with IL-6 above normal is higher in
severe group45. In terms of treatment, immunomodulatory agents can reduce mortality
and organ injury of severe influenza. However, these immunomodulatory are mostly
non-specific to viral infection but rather a systemic regulation, such as corticosteroid,
intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) or angiotensin receptor blockers46-49. Leflunomide
and its active metabolite Teriflunomide have been approved for clinical treatment for
excessive inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis50.
Our data once again proved that DHODHi could further reduce cytokine storm than
DAA drugs when using influenza-A-virus infected animal as a model. We believe that
a similar immune-regulating role of DHODHi will exist in COVID-19 patients. Thus,
by targeting DHODH, the single key enzyme in viral genome replication and immuneregulation, a dual-action of DHODH can be realized in fighting against a broad
spectrum of viruses and the corresponding pathogenic-inflammation in severe
infections. We hope our study may quickly and finally benefit the patients now suffering
from severe COVID-19 and other infectious diseases caused by emerging and reemerging viruses.

inhibitors S312 and S416 were synthesized using our previously reported synthetic
routes27,53. Leflunomide, Teriflunomide, Brequinar, Oseltamivir, Adenosine, Uridine,
Cytidine, Guanosine, Orotic acid, Dihydroorotate were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
DHODH knock-out engineered A549 cell line was generated by CRISPR/Cas9 geneediting system. The following four group primers for sgRNA were synthesized by
Generay Company (Shanghai, China), and cloned into lentiCRISPRv2 vector provided
by Dimitri Lavillette (Institute Pasteur of Shanghai, China). 293FT cells were then cotransfected with lentivirus packaging plasmids (lenti-CRISPR v2-DHODH-sgRNA,
psPAX2, and PMD2.G) by Lipofectamine® 2000 (ThermoFisher) for 48 hours. The
lentivirus supernatants were harvested after centrifugation and filtration to (then mix
supernatants of four sgRNAs) to transduce 1.5 x 106 A549 cells into a 6-well plate for
72 h at 37 °C. Cells were expanded into 10 mm plates and grown in the presence of
puromycin (5 μg/mL) for 3–5 days to select sgRNA-positive cells. Thereafter, singlecell sorting was performed in a 96-well plate to grow single clones, and western blot
using the anti-DHODH antibody (Santa Cruz) was performed to detect the expression
level of DHODH. The best KO cells with the lowest residue DHODH level were finally
used. The primers of DHODH sgRNAs were listed below:
DHODH_sg1 (F: 5’-CACCGACACCTGAAAAAGCGGGCCC-3’, R: 3’CTGTGGACTTTTTCGCCCGGGCAAA-5’)
DHODH_sg2 (F: 5’-CACCGCGTGGACGGACTTTATAAGA-3’, R: 3’CGCACCTGCCTGAAATATTCTCAAA-5’)

Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC)
ITC measurements were carried out at 25 °C on a MicroCal iTC200 (GE Healthcare).
For the titration of an inhibitor to DHODH, both were diluted using the buffer (20 mM
HEPES, pH8.0, 150 mM KCl, 10% Glycerol and 10% DMSO). The concentration of

DHODH in the cell was 20 µM, and the concentration of inhibitor in the syringe was
150 µM for S312 or 100 µM for S416. All titration experiments were performed by
adding the inhibitor in steps of 2 µL. The data were analyzed using Microcal origin
software by fitting to a one-site binding model.
Surface plasmon resonance (SPR)
Surface plasmon resonance experiments were performed with a BIAcore T200 (GE
Healthcare) according to our previous work 53. The running buffer contained 1.05×PBS,
0.005% (vol/vol) surfactant P20, pH 7.4, and 1% DMSO. The purified DHODH, which
was diluted in sodium acetate solution (pH 5.5) with a final concentration of 30 μg/mL,
was immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip by amine coupling. All analyte measurements
were performed at a flow rate of 30 μL/min. The analyte was diluted in the running
buffer from the top concentration. Data processing and analysis were performed using
BIAevaluation 1.1 software.
Anti-influenza virus activity
Based on CellTiter-Glo® Cell Viability Assay (Promega), anti-influenza virus activities
of compounds were evaluated. For compound toxicity assays (CC50), MDCK in a 96well plate at a density of 2×104cell/well were cultured in the present of serial dilutions
of compounds in infection solution (DMEM + 0.2% BSA + 25 mM HEPES + 1 μg/mL
TPCK). After 72 hours of incubation in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator, 25 µl of CellTiterGlo® reagent was added to each well, and then record the fluorescence (Luminescence)
value to reflect cell viability. For compound effective assays (EC50), the same numbers
of cells were seeded in a 96-well plate and were infected by 50 µL of a 20 TCID50 virus
suspension and another 50 µL of drug dilutions. The cells were then incubated at 37 °C
until the virus control group reached a 75%-100% cytopathic effect. Cell viability was
quantified as above. All drug concentrations were performed at least three replicates.
Data were processed with Graphpad prism software to calculate EC50 and CC50 values
of the compounds.
Anti- Zika virus activity
Aliquots of Huh7 (1x104 cells/well) were seeded into 12-well plates and infected with
the Zika virus (MOI=0.05). At 4h post-infection, the medium was removed, and cells

were treated with appropriate concentration of compounds in infection medium
(DMEM+2% FBS+25 mM HEPES). After 7 days, the supernatant was collected and
RNA was extracted by TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) and submitted to reverse
transcription-quantitative PCR with the PrimeScript RT reagent kit (TaKaRa). The
primers to detect Zika-specific RNA were listed below: Zika virus NS3 (F: 5’CTCCAGGATGCAAGTCTAAG -3’, R: 5’- ACCCAGCAGGAACTTCAGGA -3’).
All drug concentrations were performed at least three replicates. Data were processed
with Graphpad prism software to calculate EC50 and CC50 values of the compounds.
Bright-Glo Pharmacodynamic assay for Ebola Replicon
Ebolavirus must be operated in the BSL-4 laboratory. To reduce the biological safety
risks, the Ebolavirus replicon system was chosen for antiviral efficacy assay54. BSR
T7/5 cells (T7 RNA polymerase stable expressing cell) were seeded in 96-well plates
and co-transfected with p3E5E-Luc (25 ng), pCEZ-NP (25 ng), pCEZ-VP35 (25 ng),
pCEZ-VP30(15 ng), and pCEZ-L (150 ng) per well. Afterward, 50 μL of drug dilutions
were added into each well and cultured in at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 24 hours. Replicon
efficacy was determined by adding 50 μL/well of Bright-Glo reagent to record the
fluorescence (Luminescence) values. All drug concentrations were performed at least
three two replicates. Data were processed with Graphpad prism software to calculate
EC50 and CC50 values of the compounds.

IFA assay of SARS-CoV-2
To detect viral protein expression in Vero E6 cells, cells were fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100. The cells were then
incubated with the primary antibody (a polyclonal antibody against the NP of a bat
SARS-related CoV) after blocking, followed by incubation with the secondary antibody
(Alexa 488-labeled goat anti-rabbit, Abcam).
Virus growth curve and plaque assay
To determine the viral growth curve, A549 (WT and DHODH-/-) cells were infected
with the indicated viruses at an MOI of 0.01. The supernatant of infected cells was
collected at different time points post-infection and titrated by plaque assay on MDCK
cells. The viral plaque assay with immunostaining was performed as previously
described55. Briefly, MDCK cells cultivated in 24-well plates were infected with WSN
virus. After 0.5 hours of incubation at 37 ℃ in 5% CO2, the virus medium was removed,
and 1 ml of 2.4% Avicel (FMC Corporation) medium in the presence of indication drugs
was added. Cells were incubated for another 48 hours at 37 ℃ in 5% CO2 and then
fixed with 4% PFA. Immunostaining was performed using an anti-NP polyclonal
antibody conjugated with HRP (Antibody Research Center, Shanghai Institute of
Biological Science). True Blue substrate (KPL) was added to visualize the plaques.
Influenza mini-replicon system and DHODH substrates assay
The 293T cells were seeded into 24-well plates at 1×105 cells per well and were
transfected with influenza A/WSN/33 virus PB1-, PB2-, PA- and NP- expressing
plasmids (100 ng each), the influenza virus-specific RNA polymerase I driven firefly
luciferase reporter (pPoⅡ-NP-luc) (100 ng, provide by Han-D Klenk, Marburg
University), and the Renilla luciferase reporter pRLSV40 10 ng, Promega). After 12
hours, the transfected 292T cells were treated with different concentrations of the test
compounds or exogenous nucleosides (Adenosine, Uridine, Cytidine, Guanosine) or
orotic acid or dihydroorotate. Cells were harvested after another 24 hours and firefly
luciferase and Renilla luciferase expression were determined using the Dual-Luciferase
Assay Kit (Promega).

BALB/c female mice, 6-8 weeks old, were purchased from LingChang Company and
bred in the specific pathogen-free animal facility. All animal experiments were
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Institut Pasteur of
Shanghai and Wuhan University. For animal infection studies, mice were anesthetized
using diethyl ether and intranasally challenged with virus suspension, i.e. 4000 PFU of
A/WSN/33 H1N1 in 50ul of PBS and 600 PFU of A/SC/09 (H1N1) in 30ul of PBS,
respectively. Diluted compounds were given by intraperitoneal (i.p) injection once a
day. The drug treatment was initiated on days 0, 3, 5, 6, 7 post-infection respectively
and continued for several days. Animal weight and survival were monitored daily, and
mice were euthanized until the end of the experiment or when body-weight lost more
than 25%.

S312+Oseltamivir (5mg/kg+20mg/kg) were given i.p. once per day from D6 to D13 in
E. The green bars indicate the period of drug administration. The body weight and
survival were monitored until 14 days post-infection or when the bodyweight reduced
to 75%, respectively (n =4-5 mice per group). The dotted line indicates endpoint for
mortality (75% of initial weight). The body weights are present as the mean percentage
of the initial weight ±SD of 4-5 mice per group and survival curve were shown.
