Summary: (177 words)
Although vaccines have been successfully developed and approved against
SARS-CoV-2, it is still valuable to perform studies on conserved antigenic sites
for preventing possible pandemic-risk of other SARS-like coronavirus in the
future and prevalent SARS-CoV-2 variants. By antibodies obtained from
convalescent COVID-19 individuals, receptor binding domain (RBD) were
identified as immunodominant neutralizing domain that efficiently elicits
neutralizing antibody response with on-going affinity mature. Moreover, we
succeeded to define a quantitative antigenic map of neutralizing sites within
SARS-CoV-2 RBD, and found that sites S2, S3 and S4 (new-found site) are
conserved sites and determined as subimmunodominant sites, putatively due
to their less accessibility than SARS-CoV-2 unique sites. P10-6G3, P07-4D10
and P05-6H7, respectively targeting S2, S3 and S4, are relatively rare
antibodies that also potently neutralizes SARS-CoV, and the last mAbs
performing neutralization without blocking S protein binding to receptor. Further,
we have tried to design some RBDs to improve the immunogenicity of
conserved sites. Our studies, focusing on conserved antigenic sites of SARSCoV-2 and SARS-CoV, provide insights for promoting development of universal

Introduction:
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes the
ongoing outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), resulting in a global
pandemic (1, 2). As of April 9, 2021, SARS-CoV-2 has caused more than 133
million people infection around the world including about 3 million deaths, which
lead to unprecedented enormous global health and economic damage. The ~30

kb RNA genome of SARS-CoV-2 encodes four structural proteins including the
spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, and nonstructural proteins, as well as a number of accessory proteins (3). The
transmembrane spike glycoprotein is divided into S1 comprising receptor
binding domain (RBD) and N-terminal domain (NTD), and S2 which promotes
membrane fusion by fusion peptide. As most neutralizing mAbs isolated from
convalescent COVID-19 individuals target RBD (4-8), by which S protein binds
to receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and promotes exposure
of fusion peptides within S2 component contributing to viral membrane fusion
with host cells, it is main target for design of therapeutics and vaccine (9, 10).
Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) infecting human are composed of HCoVOC43, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63, as well as the highly
pathogenic

MERS-CoV,

SARS-CoV

and

SARS-CoV-2.

SARS-CoV-2

phylogenetically close to SARS-CoV is classified into the Betacoronavirus
genus including another highly pathogenic MERS-CoV, as well as HCoV-OC43
and HCoV-HKU1 variants leading to endemic (11, 12). Historically, there have
been three HCoVs infections causing severe syndrome, including SARS
outbreak that initially identified as an exotic infection in coronaviruses evolution,
MERS-CoV outbreak as a second hard hit, and current COVID-19 pandemic
(13-16). These studies reveal that it is reasonable to speculate on the possibility
of emergence of other SARS-like coronavirus in the future. Hence, it is certainly
valuable to promote development of more universal coronavirus vaccines and
broader therapeutic agents by characterization of conserved antigenic sites in
SARS-CoV-2 RBD to enhance our preparedness against the possible
pandemic-risk of SARS-like coronavirus in the future. Moreover, as the duration
of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic extends, currently, there has been multiple
variants emerging around the world. Although D614G mutation in the S protein
significantly promotes corresponding variants infectivity in susceptible cells, this
residue substitutions fails to cause immune escape (17-21). Conversely, many

results support that the predominant SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.351 in South
Africa, with many crucial mutations in RBD including K417N, E484K and N501Y,
could decrease therapeutic efficacy of neutralizing antibodies and even
compromise protective efficacy of approved SARS-CoV-2 vaccines targeting
the initial SARS-CoV-2 that emerged in 2019 (20, 22-25). Hence, universal
SARS-like coronavirus vaccines based on the conserved antigenic sites in RBD
also is potential in prevention against highly pathogenic SARS-CoV-2 variants
that could escape from the established specific immune memory.
Although SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV share 90% amino acid identity in S2
domain, SARS-CoV-2 RBD just shows lower 73% amino acid identity with
SARS-CoV RBD (12), implying that there may be less conserved antigenic sites
within RBD. Nevertheless, some highly conserved epitopes on the SARS-CoV
RBD have been identified by mAbs CR3022 (26), S309 (27) and ADI-56046
(28), the cross-binding mAbs that were originally isolated from SARS patient,
of which S309 and ADI-56046 could efficiently neutralize infection of SARSCoV-2 and SARS-CoV. In addition, many human mAbs targeting SARS-CoV-2
S protein have been reported, which were isolated from convalescent COVID19 individuals, however, cross-binding mAbs are relatively rarely shown,
especially cross-neutralizing mAbs (29-31), indicating that SARS-CoV-2
conserved antigenic sites within RBD is subimmunodominant compared to its
unique sites. While some conserved antigenic sites have been identified by
cross-binding mAbs including CR3022 (26), S309 (27) and ADI-56046 (28) from
SARS-CoV survivors as well as COVA1-16 (5), EY6A (8) and 2-36 (32) from
COVID-19 individual, no studies are performed to quantitatively define
antigenic map of conserved sites in SARS-CoV-2 RBD.
In this study, 77 SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific antibodies were isolated from a
cohort of 10 convalescent COVID-19 individuals for further biophysical
characterization, by which we succeeded to define a quantitative antigenic map
of neutralizing sites within SARS-CoV-2 RBD. We found that sites S2, S3 and
4

S4 were conserved sites and were subimmunodominant compared with SARSCoV-2 unique site S1. Unlike SAS-CoV-2 unique sites, conserved sites S2, S3
and S4 are proved as less accessible sites, weakly inducing antibody affinity
mature. Moreover, to improve antibody response to conserved sites, we tried
to design some RBDs, which contributed to development of universal SARSlike coronavirus vaccines.

Results:
Seroconversion of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in convalescent
COVID-19 individuals and isolation of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific
antibodies
We collected blood samples from 10 convalescent COVID-19 individuals
between February and March 2020, who were previously infected with SARSCoV-2, confirmed by PCR (polymerase chain reaction), and accompanied with
fever, cough and other symptoms (Table. S1). The humoral immune response
was efficiently elicited for these convalescent individuals with high plasma titer
of RBD-specific IgG with difference less than an order of magnitude (Table. S2).
Since plasma neutralizing capacity strongly correlates with RBD-specific total
antibody and IgG titer, indicating that RBD of S protein is dominant target of
neutralizing antibodies elicited by SARS-CoV-2 infection, plasma titer of RBDspecific total antibody and IgG titer might be identified as effective evaluation
indicator in the selection of COVID-19 convalescent volunteers for collection of
potent neutralizing plasma in emergency circumstances (Fig. S1). The
proportion of RBD-specific B cells in memory B cells ranged from 0.03% to
0.18%，and the RBD-specific memory B cells contained higher percentage of
IgG subtype than IgM subtype, revealing that SARS-CoV-2 infection efficiently
promoted B cell receptor (BCR) class switch and affinity maturate in
convalescent individuals, thus eliciting strong humoral immune response
against SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. S2A, B and C). Nevertheless, how SARS-CoV-2

RBD-specific antibodies inhibit infection is still not clear, to this end, 77 RBDspecific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were obtained from 10 convalescent
individuals for comprehensive feature description (Fig. S2D).
Characterization of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific mAbs obtained from
convalescent COVID-19 individuals
To identify the SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific mAbs repertoire usage, we
compared sequence with well-defined naïve repertoire of IMGT-database to
obtain assigned V region germline. Based on exclusion of clonal expansion just
in P01, P03 and P04, 67 unique clonotypes were identified. Notably, it was
found that 7 out of 8 antibody sequences obtained in P03 individual were highly
conserved, except for P03-3B1, illustrating that this clone type BCR was
immune dominant clone in P03, induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig. 1A and
Fig. S3). Furthermore, enrichment of multiple VH and VK/VL, including VH1-69,
VH3-13, VH3-30, VH3-53, VK1-39 and VL1-40, were observed, in addition,
VK1-39 derived light chains were most often combined with heavy chain of
various types VH to form antibodies, accounting for 22.4% (15/67) (Fig. S4 and
Fig. 1A). The mean somatic hypermutation (SHM) rate of heavy chain V region
was similar among individuals, and the mean levels (2%) are comparable with
those detected in infection of other respiratory virus (Fig. 1B) (33-35).
Additionally, even though the average length of CDRH3 of RBD-specific mAbs
was consistent with that of naïve repertoire (~15 amino acids), we observed
significant enrichment of shorter length CDRH3 (11 amino acids) in VH3-53/66
derived mAbs, differing from influenza virus and HIV-1 binding mAbs (Fig. 1C
and Fig. S8A) (36-38).
Subsequently, to determine profile of binding activity to SARS-CoV-2, we
assessed binding activity of these mAbs to the recombinant S protein and RBD
protein of SARS-CoV-2 using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
mAbs obtained from convalescent individuals presented binding activity to
SARS-CoV-2 S protein in diversity, 61.0% of which showed strong binding

activity (EC50 <1 μg/mL) to SARS-CoV-2 S protein, suggesting that infection of
SARS-CoV-2 can effectively stimulate the humoral immune response
producing a large number of high affinity specific mAbs (Fig. S2A and Fig. 1D).
Interestingly, while there was correlation between binding activity to SARSCoV-2 RBD and to SARS-CoV-2 S protein, some mAbs bound more strongly to
RBD protein compared to S protein, implying that their targeting antigenic
epitopes were poorly presented to be recognized in S protein, due to the
coverage by other RBD monomer or NTD domain, as previously reported (Fig.
1E) (39). Next, we assessed neutralizing activity of these mAbs using a VSV
pseudovirus model carrying SARS-CoV-2 S protein, and the neutralization IC50
potencies were shown in Fig. S5C. 80.5% (62/77) of these mAbs displayed
neutralization against SARS-CoV-2, characterized as neutralizing antibodies
(NAbs), among them 16 were identified as potent neutralizer with IC50 < 0.1
μg/mL, 22 as moderate neutralizer with IC50 of 0.1-1 μg/mL, and 24 as weak
neutralizer with IC50 of 1-100 μg/mL (Fig. 1F). Surprisingly, none of the
antibodies isolated from P03 convalescent individual had the potent
neutralizing capacity, although amount of antibodies derived from the same
clone were elicited (Fig. S6).
To investigate whether blocking S protein binding to ACE2 is the key
mechanism for NAbs to inhibit infection of SARS-CoV-2 into susceptible cells,
such as lung cells and intestinal cells, mAbs were mixed with SARS-CoV-2 S
protein at different concentrations and then added into 293T cells expressing
human ACE2 to evaluate the capability of blocking S protein entrance into cells,
as reported (40). The results showed that 61.0% of the specific mAbs had the
ability to block entrance of S protein into cells, IC50 ranging from 4 ng/mL to 100
μg/mL (Fig. S5D and Fig. 1G). These blocking and neutralizing capacity well
correlated with the binding capacity (Fig. 1H and I). In terms of the neutralization
and blocking data, we found their well correlation, indicating that blocking
attachment of SARS-CoV-2 S protein to receptor ACE2 was critical to inhibit

SARS-CoV-2 infection by NAbs targeting SARS-CoV-2 RBD (Fig. 1J and Fig.
S7). But not all of them, some NAbs neutralized SARS-CoV-2 with weakly
blocking SARS-CoV-2 S protein binding to ACE2, which is similar with
previously

observation

(27). Although

the

corresponding

neutralizing

mechanism has not been explained clearly, it is putative that binding of these
NAbs may impede sequential conformational changes of S protein for SARSCoV-2 genome intracellular release.
Abnormally enrichment of mAbs with CDRH3 of 11 amino acids displayed
strong binding activity to SARS-CoV-2 S protein, majority of them were encoded
by VH3-53/66. While recent reports demonstrated that these mAbs have innate
binding capability to SARS-CoV-2 RBD, with shorter CDRH3 for reduction of
collision with RBD, length of CDRH3 did not correlate with binding activity (Fig.
S8). To determine whether affinity of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific mAbs
efficiently evolves, we analyzed the association between binding activity of
mAbs and duration of immune response. The binding activity and neutralizing
capacity of specific mAbs correlated with days after symptom onset, illustrating
that affinity of these specific mAbs has the ability to continuously evolve (Fig.
1K and L and Fig. S9). However, plasma anti-RBD IgG titer did not correlate
with days after symptom onset for individuals, putatively due to decay of
corresponding specific mAbs production in blood (Fig. S1A) (41).
Profile of cross-binding RBD-specific antibodies
Due to 76% sequence identity shared between SARS-CoV S protein and
SARS-CoV-2 S protein, humoral immune could utilize some conserved
epitopes to produce cross-reactive mAbs (42). As expected, some of SARSCoV-2 specific mAbs also bound to SARS-CoV S protein, accounting for 50.6%
of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies, of them 11 (14.3%) recognizing SARS-CoV
S protein with strong binding activity (EC50 <1 μg/mL) (Fig. 2A and Fig. S5B).
Expectedly, these cross-binding mAbs also showed continuously affinity
maturation (Fig. 2B). It was observed that mAbs encoded by some VH germline

had a tendency to broadly reactive with SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, such as
VH1-69, VH3-13, VH3-30 and VH4-46 (Fig. 2C). Additionally, cross-binding
mAbs showed tendency of lower SHM in VH and JH region, which might limit
their affinity maturation, putatively due to less exposure of corresponding
conserved antigenic sites (Fig. 2D and E). Overall, these results confirmed
efficient cross-binding antibody response during SARS-CoV-2 infection and the
presence of conserved antigenic sites inducing the maturation of cross-reactive
mAbs.
Notably, the majority of mAbs with potent neutralization against SARS-CoV2 showed no reactivity with SARS-CoV, confirming that unique antigenic sites
in SARS-CoV-2 RBD, as immunodominant epitopes, more efficiently elicit high
affinity mAbs with potent neutralizing capacity than conserved epitopes (Fig.
2F). Subsequently, cross-binding mAbs were tested for their ability to neutralize
SARS-CoV. Our results indicate that only P10-6G3, P07-4D10, P05-6H7 and
P05-5B6 were identified as cross-neutralizing mAbs against SARS-CoV and
SARS-CoV-2, of which P10-6G3 displayed more highly binding activity to
SARS-CoV-2 S protein than SARS-CoV S protein, revealing that the SARSCoV-2 unique residues of corresponding conserved site might be more
accessible (Fig. 2F and G). Combined with binding activity, we found that the
low affinity with SARS-CoV S protein should be the reason why a large number
of cross-binding antibodies could not neutralize SARS-CoV (Fig. 2G). As the
antigenic sites recognized by these cross-neutralizing mAbs were common
between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, they can become the key targets for
design of universal vaccine against SARS-like coronavirus and for selection of
broadly therapeutic antibodies.
Functional characterization of NAbs recognizing multiple different
neutralizing antigenic sites
To investigate key neutralizing antigenic sites eliciting potent immune response,
first of all, competition-binding assay using ELISA were performed for

neutralizing mAbs. Followed by cluster analysis, the neutralizing antibodies
were classified into 6 clusters (C1-6), according to the competitive ability
resulting from sterical incompatibility when simultaneously binding to the same
SARS-CoV-2 RBD antigenic sites, and the antigenic sites for C1-6 NAbs were
respectively termed as sites S1-6 (Fig. S10 and S11 and Fig. 3A). Sites S1, S3
and S4 should be immunodominant antigenic sites, because of C1, C3 and C4
NAbs accounting for higher proportion (Fig. 3A). Notably, these NAbs of
different clusters were induced in many SARS-CoV-2 convalescent individuals,
which embodied common immunogenic characteristics of antigenic sites in
RBD protein and indicated that infection of SARS-CoV-2 can elicit similar
specific antibody response (Fig. 3B).
To determine the functional characteristics of NAbs targeting different sites,
we analyzed the biochemical properties of them elicited by sites S1-6. NAbs of
C1, C2, C4, C5 and C6 bound to SARS-CoV-2 S protein with comparable EC50,
however, NAbs elicited by site S3 displayed lower binding activity to SARSCoV-2 S protein (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, majority of C2, C3 and C4 NAbs
showed cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV S protein and SARS-CoV-2 S protein,
illustrating that these sites were conserved sites between SARS-CoV and
SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 3D and E). Nevertheless, these conserved sites just induced
4 potent cross-neutralizing mAbs (P10-6G3 targeting S2; P07-4D10 targeting
S3; P05-5B6 and P05-6H7 targeting S4) against SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2
in natural infection of SARS-CoV-2, since most cross-binding NAbs showed
obviously weaker affinity with SARS-CoV S protein compared to SARS-CoV-2
S protein, leading their incapacitation of cross-neutralization (Fig. 3C, E, F and
G). Notably, except conserved site S3, the remaining conserved sites directed
NAbs showed lower neutralization capacity against SARS-CoV-2 than NAbs
recognizing SARS-CoV-2 unique antigenic sites (sites S1, S5 and S6), under
the premise of possessing similar binding activity to SARS-CoV-2 S protein,
implying that these NAbs targeting conserved sites have a disadvantage in

blocking S protein binding to receptor, putatively due to their partial overlap with
ACE2 site (Fig. 3C and F).
C1 NAbs isolated from overwhelming majority of convalescent individuals
recognized site S1 and potently specifically inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection by
blocking S protein attachment to ACE2, revealing that site S1 is
immunodominant antigenic site in SARS-CoV-2 RBD to efficiently elicit strong
NAbs response during SARS-CoV-2 natural infection (Fig. 3F and Fig. S12A).
The immunodominance of site S1 may result from either its accessibility in
different conformation of SARS-CoV-2 S protein or the innate affinity of
corresponding C1 NAbs derived from naïve B repertoire (such as VH 3-53/66
germline), the latter factor will lead to the rapid affinity mature of C1 mAbs
without the need for high level of somatic hypermutation (31, 43, 44) (Fig. 3H).
On the contrast, while large amplification of the same antibody clone was
exhibited against site S3 in convalescent P03, the NAbs of such antibody clone
poorly inhibited infection of SARS-CoV-2, revealing that the site S3 is possibly
immunodominant weakly-neutralizing site (Fig. 3F, Fig. S6, Fig. 1A and Fig. S4).
In addition, site S4 elicited many neutralizers with weak blocking capacity, such
as P05-6H7 and P06-6E10, these NAbs might inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection
either by inhibiting conformational change of S protein necessary for membrane
fusion or by enhancing the S1 domain shedding to block SARS-CoV-2
attachment to ACE2 (Fig. 3F, G and Fig. S12). We further selected
representative antibodies targeting sites S1-6 (C1, C2, C3, C4, C5 and C6
cluster represented by P02-3C11, P10-6G3, P07-4D10, P05-6H7, P09-6G9
and P05-5C6, respectively), showing potently neutralizing capacity, as potential

Taken together, sites S2, S3 and S4 were identified as conserved antigenic
sites in SARS-CoV-2 RBD that could induce cross-neutralizing mAbs response
and are considerable in rational design of universal SARS-like coronavirus
vaccines, and sites S1, S5 and S6 as SARS-CoV-2 unique antigenic sites.
Difference in binding location possibly contributes to that NAbs elicited by
conserved antigenic sites showed weaker neutralization against SARS-CoV-2
than those by unique antigenic sites.
Identification of antigenic sites S1-6 on SARS-CoV-2 S protein
Characterization of key antigenic sites conformation is essential to present a
great promise for designing novel vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, and the
conserved antigenic sites remain to be further studied for rational design of
universal vaccine against SARS-like coronavirus. To determine the spatial
position of site S1-6, we performed mutagenesis study of SARS-CoV-2 RBD by
substituting ACE2-interactive and non-interactive residues with alanine or
arginine, and then assessed the decreased binding activity of representative
NAbs to mutant RBDs compared to the reference RBD, as previously reported
(46). The reduction of binding activity to each mutant RBDs relative to reference
RBD were shown in Fig. S13. The spatial position of all antigenic sites was
simultaneously displayed on RBD to demonstrate their relative location, which
is critical to expound functional characteristics of all neutralizing antigenic sites
in RBD (Fig. S14 and Fig. 4A). The sites S1, S5 and S6 largely overlapped with
the binding site of ACE2, supporting potent neutralizing activities of
corresponding NAbs by efficiently blocking S protein binding to receptor,
whereas site S2, S3 and S4 were positioned away from ACE2 footprint (Fig.
S14A). Hence, NAbs targeting site S3 inhibited infection with weak neutralizing
capacity, likely due to poor steric hindrance with receptor ACE2. However, site
S4-specific NAbs might neutralize infection of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV by
novel mechanism without blocking S protein attachment to ACE2.
S2, S3 and S4 were identified as conserved antigenic sites on RBD, due to

the cross-reactivity of their corresponding mAbs, which was further confirmed
by their critical residues, common between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (Fig.
4A and Fig. S14B). Additionally, by summarizing results of SARS-CoV-2
research, it was found that the RBD neutralizing antigenic sites identified by us
are similar to those by other studies (Fig. 4A) (4, 47, 48). Obviously, site S1
overlapped with Class 1 epitope, and site S5 and site S6 were adjacent to Class
2 epitopes recognized by representative C002 mAb. Site S2 was located
between Class 1 epitope and Class 4 epitope, which might be similar to site IIa
as previously reported (4). Up to now, epitopes like site S4 have not been
reported, although S309 recognizing Class 3 epitope also showed similar
functional property, neutralizing capacity without blocking S protein binding to
ACE2 (47). As some neutralizing antigenic sites are hidden by RBD lying down
state of S protein, it becomes important immune escape mechanism for SARSCoV-2 (39). It was obvious that site S5 and S6 were accessible in either RBD
lying-down state or RBD standing-up state, however, just RBD standing-up
state of S protein made site S1 more accessible for corresponding NAbs (Fig.
4B). The conserved sites are highly concealed on lying-down RBD by adjacent
RBD monomer, especially site S3. Even though RBD was in standing-up state,
on which site S3 will not be sufficiently exposed, therefor, this inadequate
exposure failed to improve affinity maturation of S3 directed mAbs (Fig. 4C, Fig.
3D and 3E). Similarly, no enough space for NAbs binding to conserved site S4
was found on closed S protein, and only RBD in standing-up state could
improve the accessibility of site S4 (Fig. 4C). In summary, these results
elucidate that the conserved antigenic sites displayed less accessibility than
SARS-CoV-2 unique epitopes, and the poor accessibility have hindered affinity
maturation of site S3 directing mAbs in natural infection and even will decrease
the cross-neutralizing antibody response after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.

Majority of mAbs recognizing antigenic site S1 were VH3-53/66 mAbs with short
(mostly 11 residues) CDRH3s. Moreover, many studies also have reported the
same enrichment of VH3-53/66 mAbs targeting the antigenic sites similar to site
S1, and find that they share structural similarities with each other by solving
structures of immune complex with SARS-CoV-2 RBD (8, 29, 48-50). These
VH3-53/66 mAbs showed native binding to SARS-CoV-2 RBD residues using
CDRH1 and CDRH2 by forming many hydrogen bonds (L455, Y473, A475 and
N487 bound by CDRH1, D420, Y421 and R457 bound by CDRH2) (Fig. 5A and
Fig. S15). Therefore, the native binding advantage of antigenic site S1 to VH353/66 was the cardinal cause of its immunodominance, which can result in the
massive amplification of antigenic site S1-specific B cells, while competing to
inhibit the proliferation of B cells directing conserved antigenic sites. To
indirectly enhance competitiveness of conserved antigenic sites for immune
response, it is essential to decrease the immunodominance of site S1. To this
end, we designed a variety of SARS-CoV-2 RBD proteins with antigenic site S1
silence using either protein truncation or glycan modification (Fig. 5B-5E). The
glycan modification at position K458 and A475 within site S1, termed as
RBDGlycan458,475, was successful to destroy the binding of S1 directed mAbs,
including p02-3C11 derived from VH3-66 and P05-5C4 derived from VH3-53,
and to maintain the remaining antigenic sites including conserved antigenic
sites S2, S3 and S4, which might efficiently enhance the competitiveness of
subimmunodominant conserved antigenic sites in immune response (Fig. 5F).
To further investigate whether the RBDGlycan458,475 could improve cross-binding
antibodies response, BALB/c mice were immunized with 20 μg/dose of
RBDGlycan458,475. Two weeks after immunization, mice receiving RBDGlycan458,475
and reference RBD protein all presented detectable serum anti-SARS-CoV S
IgG and anti-SARS-CoV-2 S IgG, however, RBDGlycan458,475 induced significantly
higher cross-binding IgG titer compared to reference RBD (Fig. 5G). Hence,
universal vaccines based on such glycan modification in SARS-CoV-2 RBD

possibly induce stronger cross-binding antibody response that could efficiently
protect from infection of SARS-like coronavirus and prevalent SARS-CoV-2
variants.

Discussion
This study provided a qualitative and quantitative analysis of SARS-CoV-2
RBD-specific antibody response

through

10

convalescent COVID-19

individuals recruited between February and March 2020. SARS-CoV-2 RBD
was defined as the immunodominant domain within SARS-CoV-2 S protein, as
previously reported (4), putatively supported by its few glycosylation sites
compared with the remaining S protein domains and higher accessibility on S
protein with variable conformations, as well as by S1 domain shedding (27, 28,
51). In addition, 80.5% of RBD-specific mAbs displayed neutralizing capacity,
of which 16 mAbs were identified as potent neutralizer with IC50 < 0.1 μg/mL
further confirming RBD as immunodominant neutralizing domain, which results
from not only its strong immunogenicity but interaction with receptor ACE2.
Similar to others virus infection, an increase in mAbs binding activity to SARSCoV-2 S protein accompanied by stronger neutralizing capacity over time was
determined, related to ongoing affinity mature of antibody response, revealing
that SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific mAbs could maintain on-going affinity
maturation. Interestingly, these SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific mAbs obtained from
convalescent individuals showed low level of somatic hypermutation, especially
mAbs from P01, revealing that naïve BCR repertoire may contribute to rapid
mAbs response to SARS-CoV-2 RBD and that some mAbs encoded by
germline genes may have the advantages of innate ability to recognize SARSCoV-2 RBD, such as mAbs derived from VH3-53/66 (31, 43, 44). These findings
suggest that common neutralizing mAbs response might be efficiently induced
by SARS-CoV-2 vaccine composed of RBD.
Structural studies have proved that the S protein possesses conformational

dynamics, in which different pre-fusion conformations expose a variety of
crucial epitopes, including conserved antigenic sites between SARS-CoV and
SARS-CoV-2 that can be recognized by cross-binding mAbs (31, 52). Although
some conserved antigenic sites, identified by cross-binding mAbs, have been
reported, systematic analysis of conserved antigenic sites is still lacking, which
is prejudicial to rational design of universal vaccine (4-8). We used information
obtained from neutralizing mAbs to develop a quantitative antigenic map of
SARS-CoV-2 RBD neutralizing sites that demonstrates immunodominance,
neutralization properties and conserved properties. We found that site S2, S3
and S4 (these sites defined by mAbs P10-6G3, P07-4D10 and P05-6H7,
respectively) are conserved antigenic sites that can elicit cross-binding mAbs
response against SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. However, these conserved
antigenic sites are subimmunodominant, and S3 only induce lower-affinity
mAbs response compared to site S1, an unique antigenic site that is
immunodominant and coincides with the ACE2 footprint, putatively related to
their lower accessibility in a variety of conformations. Even though adjacent
RBD is in standing-up state, the site S3 and S4 will not be sufficiently exposed
for specific-mAbs recognition. Additionally, the unique antigenic site S1 with the
native binding advantage to VH3-53/66 might further suppress humoral
immune response to the conserved antigenic sites through the depletion of a
large number of B cells. mAbs P10-6G3, P07-4D10, P05-5B6 and P05-6H7
recognizing sites S2, S3 and S4 efficiently inhibit SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 infection into vulnerable host cells, further confirming that these conserved
sites could serve as crucial antigenic sites for universal vaccine. Although site
S4 is far from ACE2 binding site, corresponding mAbs P05-5B6 and P05-6H7
can neutralize SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infection without blocking S
protein binding to ACE2, as reported S309 (47). Majority of potently neutralizing
antibodies inhibit viral infection by blocking spike proteins attachment with
receptors (53-55), however, we speculate that the site S4 directed mAbs may

inhibit SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infection by intracellular neutralization
pathway, a mechanism inhibiting the release of virus within endosome into
cytoplasm, as reported in recent studies (40).
Since SARS-CoV-2 unique antigenic sites (S1, S5 and S6) in RBD efficiently
provoke specific antibody response and strongly inhibit the production of crossbinding antibodies, these antigenic sites, especially site S1, should be silenced
for universal vaccine design. Moreover, some predominant SARS-CoV-2
variants B.1.351 and P.1 with K417N, E484K and N501Y mutations causing
changes in antigenic sites, similar to unique antigenic sites S1, S5 and S6,
promote evasion of antibody-mediated immunity obtained from natural infection
or vaccination, however, no cross-binding mAbs displaying decreased binding
activity to these variants have been reported (20, 22-24). These findings prove
that it is difficult for universal vaccine based on unique antigenic sites in RBD
to induce conserved antibodies response to prevent the possible pandemic-risk
of SARS-like coronavirus in the future or persistent SARS-CoV-2 variants with
antigenic drift, nevertheless, focusing on the conserved antigenic sites might
have great potential for universal SARS-like coronavirus vaccines (56).
Similar strategies for universal vaccine design have been proposed for
development of universal influenza virus vaccines that protect from infection
with drifted seasonal and novel pandemic influenza virus strains (57, 58).
Candidates of universal influenza vaccines are mainly based on the conserved
antigenic sites in stalk domain of the hemagglutinin, for example, headless
hemagglutinin structures and the display of conserved stalk-epitopes on
nanoparticles, which currently shows promising results in animal models and
has great reference significance (59-62). We defined site S1 as SARS-CoV-2
unique immunodominant site, the dominance is related to its greater
accessibility compared to conserved sites, and the innate binding capability of
corresponding mAbs derived from naïve B repertoire (VH 3-53/66 germline)
using CDRH1 and CDRH2 (63). To indirectly enhance competitiveness of

conserved sites for mAbs response by decreasing immunodominance of site
S1, we designed a variety of SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein with site S1 silence by
either removal of peptide fragment or glycan modification. In our study, the
designed RBDGlycan458,475 with glycan modification destroying site S1 is
successful to damage the binding of corresponding mAbs and to maintain the
remaining sites including conserved sites S2, S3 and S4. By immunized using
mice,

RBDGlycan458,475

efficiently

enhanced

the

competitiveness

of

subimmunodominant conserved sites to reach stronger cross-binding antibody
response than reference RBD, revealing that such direction of SARS-CoV-2
RBD design could promote development of universal vaccines against SARSlike coronavirus.
In summary, our studies defined quantitative antigenic map of neutralizing
sites within SARS-CoV-2 RBD and completed the characterization of
conserved antigenic sites, which is requisite for rational design of universal
vaccine. Moreover, we have tried to design some RBD proteins, aiming to
enhance the immune competitiveness of conserved antigenic sites. Although
SARS-CoV-2 vaccine has been developed and approved, our long lasting
efforts aimed to prepare universal vaccine for other human epidemic of SARSlike coronavirus possibly prevalent in the future is still necessary.

analyzed. Different color indicates each neutralizing cluster. (I) Neutralization
capacity of combination of representative NAbs targeting sites S1-6 against
SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. For panel C, D, F
and G, data were plotted as the geometric mean. n.s.: no significant difference;
*: P < 0.05; **: P< 0.01; ***: P < 0.001. The black line indicates mean value.
Statistical significance in C, D, F and G using Mann-Whitney U test.
Fig. 4. Dynamics analysis of sites S1-6 accessibility. (A) Relative position
of sites S1-6 are shown on RBD. Some SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific mAbs
reported in other studies are displayed by different colors, and purple, red, cyan
and yellow respectively indicate mAbs C102, P2B-2F6, S309 and S2A4, these
mAbs are identified as representative mAbs for Class 1-4. Deep wine indicates
different residues within RBD between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. The
glycan at position N343 is rendered as black spheres. (B) Accessible analysis
of site 1, site5 and site 6 in either standing-up RBD or lying-down RBD of S
protein. Red, yellow and purple denote critical residue of site S1, site S5 and
site S6 on RBD of S protein, respectively (PDB code: 6VYB and 6VXX). (C)
Accessible analysis of conserved sites S2, S3 and S4 in either lying-down RBD
of S protein (PDB code: 6VXX) or standing-up RBD of S protein (PDB code:
6VYB). Red, yellow and purple denote critical residue of sites S2, S3 and S4.

targeting different antigenic sites. (G) Antibody response against SARS-CoV S
protein and SARS-CoV-2 S protein induced by designed RBDGlycan458,475 in mice
(N=3). BALB/c mice were immunized with 20 μg/dose at weeks 0, and serum
specific IgG titers were tested at weeks 2. The ratio of serum IgG titer against
SARS-CoV S protein and SARS-CoV-2 S protein was also calculated. For panel
G, data were plotted as the geometric mean or mean. Statistical significance in
G using non-paired t test, and * indicates P < 0.05.
