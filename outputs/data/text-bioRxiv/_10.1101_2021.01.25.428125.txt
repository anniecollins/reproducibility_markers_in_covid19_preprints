Abstract

25

Advancing age and chronic health conditions, significant risk factors for severe

26

COVID-19, are associated with a pro-inflammatory state, termed inflamm-aging.

27

CXCR6+ T cells are known to traffic to the lung and have been reported to increase with

28

age. The ligand of CXCR6, CXCL16, is constitutively expressed in the lung and

29

upregulated during inflammatory responses and the CXCR6/CXCL16 axis is associated

30

with severe lung disease and pneumonia. Genome-wide association studies have also

31

recently identified 3p21.31, encompassing the CXCR6 gene, as a susceptibility locus for

32

severe COVID-19. We assessed numbers T cells expressing the chemokine receptor

33

CXCR6 and plasma levels of CXCL16, in control and COVID-19 patients. Results

34

demonstrated that circulating CD8+CXCR6+ T cells were significantly elevated with

35

advancing age, yet virtually absent in patients with severe COVID-19. Peripheral levels

36

of CXCL16 were significantly upregulated in severe COVID-19 patients compared to

37

either mild COVID-19 patients or SARS-CoV-2 negative controls. This study supports

38

a significant role of the CXCR6/CXCL16 axis in the immunopathogenesis of severe

39

COVID-19.

Introduction

43

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by infection with severe acute

44

respiratory syndrome coronavirus-type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), encompasses clinical

45

phenotypes ranging from asymptomatic infection, through to severe disease and death.

46

The more severe end of this spectrum is often associated with respiratory pathology (1,

47

2). It is well established that the course of any infection is dependent on a number of

48

variables including pathogen virulence, environmental and host factors. The latter

49

includes variation in the immune response driven by genetics, age and the presence of

50

co-morbidities. SARS-CoV-2 infection induces both innate and adaptive immunity (3)

51

and severe COVID-19 is associated with exaggerated T cell responses producing

52

increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1 (4, 5).

53

This aggressive hyper-inflammatory state results in significant lung damage and high

54

mortality (4). Post-mortem studies have shown both lymphocyte and neutrophil lung

55

infiltration, indicating that migration of pro-inflammatory cells into the lung is a key

56

step in the pathology and outcome of this infection (6, 7). Immunomodulatory therapies,

57

including the anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibody tocilizumab and the corticosteroid

58

dexamethasone, may improve outcomes, highlighting the importance of inflammatory

59

processes in COVID-19 pathology (8, 9).

60
61

Current epidemiological studies have identified advancing age, chronic health

62

conditions, such as diabetes and obesity, and certain ethnicities as risk factors for more

63

severe disease (10). Advancing age has been strongly associated with a pro-

64

inflammatory immune phenotype, so-called inflamm-aging, where T cells acquire a

65

more innate NK cell-like pro-inflammatory phenotype associated with upregulation of

66

markers of both T cell exhaustion and senescence (11). Furthermore, increased

67

expression of chemokine receptors, including CXCR6 on T cells, has been

demonstrated in aging animal models (12). The receptor CXCR6 (CD186) is expressed

69

on activated T cells, NK cells, NKT cells and mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT)

70

cells (13-15).

Results and Discussion

74

We assessed the expression of CXCR6+ on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in consecutive blood

75

samples to determine age-related differences and thereby support a potential role of

76

these cells in inflamm-aging and justify further assessment in the pathogenesis of

77

COVID-19 (16-18) (Figure 1).

78
79

Patients over 65 years of age are known to have more severe outcomes in COVID-19

80

(19). In keeping with the inflamm-aging hypothesis, we demonstrated a highly

81

significant increase in CD8+CXCR6+ T cells in the blood of patients aged over 65 years

82

(n=96) compared to those aged under 65 years (n=137) (p<0.0001; Figure 1c). A

83

progressive increase with advancing age was also observed (Rs 0.39, p<0.0001; Figure

84

1d). There were lower proportions of CD4+CXCR6+ T cells were observed compared to

85

CD8+CXCR6+ T cells and there were no significant age-related differences (Figure 1g

86

and 1h). The increased frequency of CD8+CXCR6+ T cells in the blood of older patients

87

is supportive of a pro-inflammatory phenotype, potentially rendering this group

88

susceptible to hyper-inflammatory immune responses associated with poor outcomes in

89

COVID-19.

90
91

Peripheral blood T lymphopenia has been identified as an immunological marker for

92

SARS-CoV-1 and 2 infection with postulated mechanisms including immune-mediated

93

destruction and trafficking to pathological sites (20-22). We analysed the absolute

94

numbers and proportion of CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells and NK cells relative to total

95

leucocytes in controls, mild and severe COVID-19 patients. There was an absolute and

96

proportional reduction in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in severe COVID-19 (Figure 2). This

97

was more pronounced for CD8+ T cells, with statistical significance in severe COVID-

98

19 compared to controls (p<0.001 and p<0.0001 for absolute number and proportion

99

respectively). There was no significant difference in NK cells.

100
101

The receptor for SARS-CoV-2 is angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) which is

102

highly expressed on alveolar epithelial type II cells of the lower respiratory tract (23).

103

Membrane bound CXCL16 is constitutively expressed on bronchial epithelial cells and

104

is released in metalloprotease-dependent manner in an inflammatory environment,

105

producing a soluble form which is chemotactic for CXCR6+ T-cells (24, 25). The

106

CXCR6/CXCL16 axis mediates homing of T cells to the lungs in disease (26-28) and

107

hyper-expression is associated with localised cellular injury (29-31). Murine studies

108

have demonstrated that this axis is involved in lung pathology associated with other

109

infections, including influenza, with antagonism resulting in reduced tissue

110

inflammation (26, 29).

111
112

CXCL16 is up-regulated during viral infections and mediates CD8+CXCR6+ T-cell

113

recruitment (32, 33). Differential expression of CXCR6 and CXCL16 mRNA was

114

observed in severe COVID-19 compared to mild disease (34) and significant functional

115

polymorphisms in CXCR6 are linked to viral control (35). Furthermore, in HIV

116

infection CXCR6 polymorphisms have been linked with certain ethnicities associated

117

with more severe lung pathology and poorer outcomes (36). We compared peripheral

118

blood T cell populations in severe and mild COVID-19 to control samples. This

119

revealed that absolute CD8+ CXCR6+ T cell populations were significantly reduced in

120

both severe and mild COVID-19 patients compared to controls (p<0.0001 and p<0.1

121

respectively; Figure 3e), with significant reduction in absolute CD4+ CXCR6+ T cells

122

only between severe COVID-19 and controls (p<0.001; Figure 3g). Strikingly, both

123

CD4+ and CD8+ CXCR6+ expressing T cells were present at extremely low proportions

124

in the blood of severe COVID-19 patients (n=12).

125
126

Studies in COVID-19 patients suggest CXCR6 correlates directly with the proportion of

127

MAIT cells and that this population is reduced in the peripheral blood in COVID-19

128

(37). Killer cell lectin like receptor subfamily B, member 1 (CD161) is a C-type lectin

129

receptor expressed on NK cells and a subset of T cells with both stimulatory and

130

inhibitory functions. Expression of this marker was assessed on CD8+ T cells as high

131

levels of expression have been associated with MAIT cells and Th17 responses (38).

132

We demonstrated that the majority of CD3+ CD8+ CXCR6+ T cells in controls and mild

133

COVID-19 cases were CD161++ CD45RA- CD27+ HLA-DR- CD57- (Figure 3 and

134

Supplementary Figure 1) suggestive of an effector memory profile. In most cases these

135

cells were also positive for CD56 and CD279 (see Supplementary Figure 1), consistent

136

with either NKT cells, invariant T cells or mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells

137

(13). CD8+ CXCR6+ CD161- T cells were present in lower numbers and there was no

138

significant difference in this population between COVID-19 patients and controls.

139

Proportions of both CD4+ CXCR6+ CD161++ and CD4+ CXCR6+ CD161- T cells were

140

lower compared to CD8+ T cells. The extended phenotype of the CD4+ CXCR6+

141

CD161++ is suggestive of an effector/central memory population (Supplementary Figure

142

1).

143
144

Cells with this phenotype have been shown to exhibit tissue homing properties, with

145

infiltrates described in inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis,

146

multiple sclerosis and Crohn’s disease (39). Levels of circulating and pancreatic MAIT-

147

cells in type 1 diabetes mirror the findings of our MAIT-like cells in COVID-19. In type

148

1 diabetes high levels of circulating cells are present at diagnosis with numbers falling

149

after 1 year with a concurrent increase in pancreatic numbers suggesting trafficking and

150

a potential pathogenic role (40).

151
152

To further characterise the CXCR6/CXCL16 axis in the immunopathogenesis of

153

COVID-19, plasma concentrations of CXCL16 from 28 COVID-19 patients and 12

154

controls were assessed. CXCL16 was significantly elevated in severe COVID-19

155

samples (n=10) when compared with mild COVID-19 (n=18, p<0.0001) or controls

156

(n=12, p <0.001; Figure 4a), which contrasts with the findings of Liao et al (41) where

157

CXCL16 mRNA was more highly expressed in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in mild

158

disease, albeit with significantly fewer patient numbers in all groups. There was an

159

inverse relationship between the concentration of blood CXCL16 and the proportion of

160

CD8+ and CD4+ CXCR6+ T cells in the blood in COVID-19 patients (Figures 4b and

161

4c). This suggests trafficking of CXCR6+ T cells to the lung drives a pro-inflammatory

162

immunopathology in severe COVID-19, with these cells infiltrating into the tissue,

163

which is supported by lower numbers of CD8+ T cells reported in broncho-alveolar

164

lavage in mild compared to severe COVID-19 patients (41). Furthermore, the

165

CXCR6/CXCL16 axis has been implicated in both infective (influenza) and non-

166

infective (sarcoidosis) inflammatory lung diseases (25, 26). However, this inverse

167

relationship between CXCL16 levels and CXCR6+ T cells and may also be explained by

168

either CXCL16 binding to CXCR6 causing receptor internalisation, epitope masking or

169

CXCL16-mediated T cell apoptosis.

170

Following infection with SARS-CoV-2, there is potential for pre-existing inflammatory

171

CXCR6+ populations, associated with either co-morbidity and/or inflamm-aging, to be

172

recruited from the blood to the lungs mediated by CXCL16, resulting in more severe

173

disease (42). Similarly, in other diseases characterised by a T cell infiltrate, such as type

174

1 diabetes, high expression of this chemokine receptor and ligand have been reported in

175

pancreatic tissue where they play a role in inflammation (43).

176
177

CD8+CD161++CXCR6+ T cells, have the capacity to be cytotoxic and express the

178

transcription factor RORγt, which is associated with a Th17-like phenotype and a pro-

179

inflammatory cytokine profile (IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-17 and IL-22) along with expression

180

of cytotoxic mediators such as granzyme (14, 44). These factors have all been shown to

181

be significantly elevated in severe, but not mild COVID-19 patients, despite a more

182

profound lymphopenia (45, 46). These cells have also been implicated in other lung

183

infections, with IL-17 mediated inflammation and pathogenesis reported in patients with

184

immune-mediated community-acquired pneumonia (47). A similar Th17 profile has

185

been described in patients with COVID-19(48) along with a significant reduction in

186

circulating CD161++ cells (48, 49). It is likely that these CD161++ cells are identical to

187

the T cells identified in this study. As well as mediating chemotaxis of inflammatory

188

cells, murine studies suggest that elevated levels of CXCL16 may directly contribute to

189

lung injury through production of reactive oxygen species and compromised epithelial

190

barrier integrity, with CXCL16 inhibitors protecting against lipopolysaccharide-

191

mediated lung injury (29).

192
193

This study demonstrates an age-related increase in CD8+CXCR6+ T cells consistent

194

with inflamm-aging in humans and that more severe outcomes in COVID-19 associate

195

with increased peripheral CXCL16 and reduced circulating CXCR6+ T cells, suggesting

196

an immunopathogenic role. This may have significant implications in the stratification

197

of the risk for patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and raises the possibility of novel
