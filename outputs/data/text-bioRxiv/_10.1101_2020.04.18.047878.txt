Abstract
Mass spectrometry (MS) can deliver valuable diagnostic data that complements genomic
information and allows us to increase our current knowledge of the COVID-19 disease caused
by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We developed a simple, MS-based method to specifically detect
SARS-CoV-2 proteins from gargle solution samples of COVID-19 patients. Our protocol
consists of an acetone precipitation and tryptic digestion of proteins contained within the
gargle solution, followed by a targeted MS analysis. Our methodology identifies unique
peptides originating from SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein. Building on these promising initial
results, faster MS protocols can now be developed as routine diagnostic tools for COVID-19
patients.

Introduction
The disease COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, was declared pandemic by the
World Health Organization on March 12, 2020 [1] and has caused more than 130,000
fatalities worldwide (date April 16, 2020). Providing novel mass spectrometry (MS)-based
diagnostic tools that complement genomic approaches is one of the major goals of the
recently formed COVID-19 mass spectrometry coalition (www.covid19-msc.org) [2]. Based
on the prospective goals of this coalition, the aim of this “proof-of-principle” study is to
highlight the potential of MS in identifying SARS-CoV-2 proteins, even from highly diluted
samples, such as gargle solutions of COVID-19 patients.

Experimental Section
Protein Precipitation and Digestion. Gargle solutions (20 ml in 0.9% NaCl) were
obtained from three patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection. All samples had
been classified as SARS-CoV-2-positive by three reverse transcription and quantitative
polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analyses identifying E-, S- and N-gene RNAs.
For protein precipitation, 1 ml of acetone (-20°C) was added to 750 µ l of gargle
solution and stored overnight at -20°C. After centrifugation, the supernatant was
discarded and the pellet was dissolved in 10 µ l of SMART Digest buffer (Thermo
Fisher Scientific). The solution was kept at 75°C for 10 min. Afterwards, 1 µ l of
PNGase F (non-reducing, NEB) was added to remove protein N-glycosylations and the
sample was incubated at 50°C for 10 minutes. 1 µ g of trypsin (SMART Digest, bulk
resin option, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added in 50 µ l of SMART Digest buffer
(Thermo Fisher Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the solution was incubated at 70°C for
30 min. Reduction and alkylation were performed with dithiothreitol (DTT) and

iodoacetamide, respectively. Before LC/MS analysis, trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) was
added to a final concentration of 0.5% (v/v).
Nano-HPLC/Nano-ESI-Orbitrap-MS/MS. LC/MS analysis was performed on a nanoHPLC system (UltiMate RSLC 3000) coupled to an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass
spectrometer with nano-ESI source (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The samples were
loaded onto a trapping column (Acclaim PepMap C18, 300 µm x 5 mm, 5 µ m, 100Å,
Thermo Fisher Scientific) and washed for 15 min with 0.1 % (v/v) TFA at a flow rate
of 30 µl/min. Trapped peptides were eluted using a separation column (200cm µ PAC,
C18, PharmaFluidics) that had been equilibrated with 3 % B (A: 0.1 % (v/v) formic
acid in water; B: 0.08 % (v/v) formic acid in acetonitrile). Peptides were separated
with linear gradients from 3 to 10 % B over 15 min, followed by 15 % B to 30 % B
over 165 minutes. The column was kept at 30°C and the flow-rate was set to 300
nl/min. Targeted MS analysis was performed based on an inclusion list of tryptic
peptides from SARS-CoV-2 proteins (see Supporting Information) [3]. In case none of
the target masses from the inclusion list was detected, a TOP-5s method was applied.
The resolving power in MS mode was set to 120,000 at m/z 200. A parallel data
acquisition strategy was employed, relying on Orbitrap-HCD (higher energy collisioninduced dissociation, R = 15,000) and linear ion trap-CID (collision-induced
dissociation)-MS/MS experiments. Database search (UniProt human, dated November
2019 with 20,315 entries, and SARS-CoV-2 [3]) was performed with Proteome
Discoverer version 2.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The search was restricted to human
and

Results and Discussion
Protein MS analysis of the three gargle samples from COVID-19 patients revealed a
vast abundance of human proteins (Supporting Information). Strikingly, our protocol
allowed us to identify unique peptides originating from SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein
that were identified in two out of three samples (Figure 1). These results are in
agreement with preceding PCR analyses, exhibiting a higher viral load in the
respective samples.

A peptide

originating from

SARS-CoV-2

nucleoprotein,

comprising the sequence RPQGLPNNTASWFTALTQHGK (amino acids 41-61; Figure
2), was found in both samples giving first hints to its value as a potential biomarker for
an MS-based COVID-19 diagnostic method. SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein packages the
positive-strand viral genome RNA into a helical ribonucleocapsid and plays a
fundamental role during virion assembly through its interactions with the viral genome
and membrane protein M [3]. It is also important for enhancing the efficiency of subgenomic viral RNA transcription, as well as viral replication [3]. The N-gene was
found to be the most expressed viral gene [4], which is in agreement with peptides of SARSCoV-2 nucleoprotein being detected in our MS analysis. Clearly, further experiments
are needed to test larger patient cohorts, but our findings show that SARS-CoV-2
proteins can be identified from highly diluted solutions. Our current method has the
drawback of long analysis times (3 hours per sample), requiring significant
optimization to be applied to high-through-put measurements of patient samples. Also,
more sensitive mass spectrometric equipment will be required to allow the detection
and quantification of a larger number of virus proteins.

Conclusions
We present a protein MS-based method to specifically detect SARS-CoV-2 virus proteins
from highly diluted gargle solutions of COVID-19 patients. This straightforward method
relies on acetone precipitation of proteins, followed by a tryptic digestion and a targeted-mass
spectrometric analysis of SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Using this approach, we were able to
identify peptides originating from SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein in gargle solution samples. We
are planning to apply our protocol to additional sample material, such as bronchoalveolar
lavage. The future goal is to provide robust, sensitive, and reliable MS-based methods as a
routine diagnostic of COVID-19 patients that complements PCR-based methods.
