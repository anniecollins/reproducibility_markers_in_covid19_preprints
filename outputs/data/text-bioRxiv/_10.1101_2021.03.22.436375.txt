Abstract

26
27

In addition to the traditional method of vaccine development, the mRNA coronavirus

28

vaccine, which is attractive as a challenging vaccination, recently opened a new era

29

in vaccinology. Here we describe the EG-COVID which is a novel liposome-based

30

mRNA candidate vaccine that encodes the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 with 2P-

31

3Q substitution in European variant. We developed the mRNA vaccine platform that

32

can be lyophilized using liposome-based technology. Intramuscular injection of the

33

EG-COVID elicited robust humoral and cellular immune response to SARS-CoV-2.

34

Furthermore, sera obtained from mice successfully inhibited SARS-CoV-2 viral

35

infection into Vero cells. We developed EG-COVID and found it to be effective based

36

on in vitro data, and we plan to initiate a clinical trial soon. Since EG-COVID is a

37

lyophilized mRNA vaccine that is convenient for transportation and storage,

38

accessibility to vaccines will be significantly improved.

Introduction

47
48

COVID-19 is caused by the coronavirus, which is an enveloped RNA virus that is

49

widely distributed in humans, other mammals, and birds and causes respiratory,

50

intestinal, liver, and nerve diseases. (Weiss et al., 2011). In addition to the very

51

common coronavirus responsible for the human common cold, there are three

52

coronaviruses that cause serious illness in humans: SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and

53

SARS-CoV-2 (Cox et al., 2020). In December 2019, an outbreak of severe acute

54

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (now namely, SARS-CoV-2) infection occurred at

55

seafood market in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, and spread across China (Zhu et

56

al., 2020). Considering the rapid spread of this virus and its impact on an

57

international scale, COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health

58

Organization on March 11, 2020 (WHO,1 DEC 2020). The urgent development of

59

safe and effective vaccines in the global coronavirus pandemic has become a

60

common goal for humanity, where numerous multinational pharmaceutical

61

companies and biotechnology companies are immersed in the development of

62

COVID-19 vaccines around the world simultaneously.

63

The mRNA-based vaccines are in the limelight because of their potential for

64

rapid development than the conventional vaccines at the COVID-19 pandemics. The

65

history of mRNA-based vaccines is relatively short, and its first application was

66

introduced in the 1990s, using mice to intramuscularly inject mRNA to locally

67

produce an encoded reporter protein (Wolff et a.,1990). The mRNA vaccine

68

combines the benefits of the subunit vaccine and the live attenuated vaccine, and

69

there is no risk associated with the live attenuated vaccine or the DNA vaccine

70

(Reichmuth et al., 2016). Of all the viral antigens studied, the spike (S) and

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.22.436375; this version posted March 24, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

71

nucleocapsid (N) proteins are considered to be important immunogenic antigens for

72

SARS-CoV-2 (Assadiasl, 2020). Among these, most vaccine candidates use the

73

coronavirus glycosylated spike protein (S) as the primary antigenic target.

74

Liposomes are defined as phospholipid vesicles consisting of one or more

75

concentric lipid bilayers enclosing discrete aqueous spaces and its use as

76

pharmaceutical applications are well known (Ickenstein et al., 2019, Torchilin, 2005,

77

Sercombe et al., 2015). In 1970, liposomes were proposed as a drug carrier for

78

altering the therapeutic index of a drug by reducing toxicity or increasing the efficacy

79

of the parent drug (Lian et al., 2001). Vartak and colleagues suggested the use of

80

liposome as antigen or immunomodulatory molecules carrier (Vartak et al., 2016).

81

Furthermore, cationic liposome is considered as an effective adjuvant for vaccine

82

delivery as well as enhancing both cellular and humoral immune reactions (Mai et al.,

83

2020). As a reference, Herpes zoster vaccines are reported to use neutral or cationic

84

liposome as antigen delivery systems (Lal et al., 2015, Cunningham et al., 2016, Wui

85

et al, 2019, and 2021). Cationic liposomes have many important safety advantages,

86

especially when making viral vectors, are less expensive, have no restrictions on the

87

size of nucleic acids, and are easily accessible without special experience in their

88

use and handling (Karmali et al., 2007). Since the cationic liposome is positively

89

charged, it is able to hold nucleic acids such as mRNA that is negatively charged and

90

deliver mRNAs to cells and tissues efficiently. When prepared under proper

91

conditions, these lipoplexes (lipid-nucleic acid complex) retain their full positive

92

charge, allowing them to efficiently bind to negatively charged cell membranes, enter

93

the cells, protects nucleic acids from nucleases in the serum or cytoplasm (Karmail

94

et al., 2007).

95

By the way, all currently developed mRNA-based vaccines employ the lipid

96

nanoparticles (LNP) as their delivery vehicles for mRNA. LNPs are composed of

97

ionizable lipid, helper lipid, cholesterol, and PEG-lipid (Kim, et al., 2021). Although

98

LNPs are very efficient tools for delivery of mRNA into human body, all the LNP

99

based vaccines are distributed in liquid form only, and require special cold chain

100

system to maintain their efficacy.

101

In this report, we established cationic liposome based mRNA delivery system

102

and developed a lyophilizable SARS-CoV2 candidate vaccine (EG-COVID) with

103

mRNA encoding the full spike glycoprotein (S) of the European mutant strain (D614G)

104

with 2P-3Q substitution (Bangaru et al., 2020). We found that EG-COVID could elicit

105

robust humoral and cellular immune response to SARS-CoV-2, furthermore, sera

106

obtained from mice successfully inhibited SARS-CoV-2 viral infection into Vero cells.

107

So here we want to describe the immunogenicity and neutralizing antibody activity of

108

the EG-COVID.

Results

146

Design and optimization of CoV2-F004 (SARS-CoV-2-2P-3Q full-length spike)

147

It was published that the substitution of K986P and K987P (2P) increase stability of

148

the protein, and the substitution of Prolines to Glutamate in S1/S2 polybasic

149

cleavage site (3Q) confers the protease resistance (Corbett et al., 2020, Torchilin,

150

2005). Based on these findings, we used the mRNA sequence encoding the SARS-

151

CoV-2 Spike protein with 2P-3Q substitutions in European variant (D614G) and

152

named CoV2-F004. The translated Spike protein from CoV2-F004 was predicted to

153

be superior to Wuhan variant (614D) in structural stability and antigen presentation

154

ability through AI-modeling simulation.

155
156

In vitro transcription of CoV2-F004 mRNA

157

CoV2-F004 mRNA was produced by TriLink biotechnologies with Cleancap®

158

technology to increase translation efficiency. 5-Methoxyuridine was used to reduce

159

immune response of cells against mRNA. Produced mRNA demonstrated an

160

expected size of single band in agarose gel electrophoresis (Figure 1C),

161

demonstrating the functionality of CoV-2-F004 structure.

Characterization of EG-COVID

164

Liquid form of EG-COVID (L-EG-COVID) and reconstituted lyophilized form of EG-

165

COVID (F-EG-COVID) were analyzed for hydrodynamic size and zeta potential. L-

166

EG-COVID and F-EG-COVID had a Z-average diameter of 191.7 ± 8.5 nm and

167

266.7±12.2 nm with a polydispersity index (PDI) of 0.2 and a zeta potential of –54.5

168

± 3 mV and –44.4 ± 2.1 mV, respectively (Figure 2A, 2B, 2D and 2E). Cryo-

169

transmission electron microscopy (Cryo-TEM) of L-EG-COVID and F-EG-COVID

170

revealed that both of EG-COVID mostly forms small unilamellar vesicles (SUV) with

171

diameter of 80-100 nm (Figure 2C and Figure 2F).

172
173

Cationic liposomes as mRNA delivery carriers

174

In order to confirm the ability of cationic liposomes as mRNA delivery carriers, complexes

175

of cationic liposomes and Renilla luciferase mRNA were prepared and intramuscularly

176

injected into mice to confirm the mRNA delivery ability of cationic liposomes. We used 1

177

to 20 μg of mRNA complexed with cationic liposomes and observed that the expression

178

of Renilla luciferase was successfully achieved. The level of expression of 10 ug of

179

mRNA with cationic liposome was similar to the level of 10 μg of mRNA delivered using

180

lipid nano particle. Therefore, we concluded that our liposome complex is nicely

181

functional as mRNA delivery carriers for mRNA vaccines (Figure 3A). In addition, we

182

prepared a lyophilized form of the Renilla luciferase mRNA-cationic liposome complex

183

and confirmed that the lyophilized form of the complex has similar mRNA delivery

184

capability to that of the liquid form (Figure 3B).

186

In vitro Expression of EG-COVID

187

We have generated a complex with cationic liposomes as a delivery system of Cov2-

188

F004 naming them as EG-COVID and verified the ability to deliver Cov2-F004

189

mRNA and expression of SARS-CoV2 spike protein in vitro (Figure 4). Re-hydrated

190

lyophilized form of EG-COVID 001, 002, 003 and 004, which were prepared

191

differently in their lipid composition, were treated in the culture medium of 293T cells,

192

and expression of SARS-Cov2 protein was confirmed by western blot after 24-hour

193

incubation. It was confirmed that there was some difference in the expression of

194

protein depending on the lipid composition of EG-COVID.

195
196

Immunogenicity of EG-COVID

197

Female B6C3F1/slc mice were immunized by intramuscular administration of L-EG-

198

COVID and F-EG-COVID twice at 3-week interval. After 2 weeks of last administration,

199

mice were sacrificed to evaluate immunogenicity of EG-COVID. We used both liquid (L-

200

EG-COVID) and lyophilized (F-EG-COVID) form of EG-COVID in the experiment.

201

Humoral immunity was confirmed by anti-RBG antibody titer, and cellular immunity

202

was confirmed by the amount of IFN-γ secreted from splenocytes stimulated with S1 and

203

S2 peptides. We found that both liquid and lyophilized form of EG-COVID induced

204

humoral and cellular immunity successfully (Figure 5A and 5B).

205

We also verified that the antibody formed by EG-COVID actually has neutralizing

206

ability against SARS-CoV2 virus. The result obtained using surrogate virus neutralization

207

tests which assess RBD binding ability of antibodies showed that EG-COVID

208

immunization successfully generated RBD binding antibodies in serum. Furthermore,

209

EG-COVID immunized serum significantly inhibited plaque formation induced by Wuhan

210

variant of SARS-CoV2 virus infection into VERO cells. There was no difference in EG-

211

COVID immunization ability between liquid and lyophilized formulations (Figure 5C and

212

5D). Therefore, we can conclude that EG-COVID induced a sufficient level of humoral

213

and cellular immunity against SARS-CoV-2 virus and is a first-class candidate for mRNA

214

vaccine that can be easily lyophilized.

Bioluminescence imaging

306

For bioluminescence imaging studies, 6-week-old female Balb/c nude or C57BL/6N

307

mice (SLC, Japan) were used. The mice received Renilla luciferase mRNA-liposome

308

(or lipid nanoparticle) complex intramuscularly. 6 hours after the administration, mice

309

were anesthetized with intraperitoneal injection of Avertin working solution (Sigma

310

Aldrich, MO, USA), then, 0.15 mg/mL ViviRen luciferase substrate (Promega, WI,

311

USA) were injected intravenously as 1mg/kg. The bioluminescence imaging was

312

obtained with Ami HTX (Spectral Instruments Imaging, AZ, USA) immediately after

313

the injection of substrate. All images were taken under 60 seconds of exposure time

314

and analyzed with Aura software (Spectral Instruments Imaging, AZ, USA). The

315

regions of interest (ROIs, photons/s) were manually selected based on the signal

For immunogenicity studies, 6-week-old female B6C3F1 mice (SLC, Japan) were

320

randomly assigned into experimental groups (n = 6). The Mice were immunized

321

intramuscularly two doses at 3-week intervals with an EG-COVID (L-EG-COVID, F-

322

EG-COVID). Two weeks after the final immunization, blood was obtained by cardiac

323

puncture and spleen were isolated from the immunized mice. Sera were obtained by

324

centrifugation at 3,000 RPM for 5 minutes at room temperature and kept at -70°C

Discussion

396

Even in the current situation, we are experiencing the profound health threat of

397

COVID-19 to humanity on a daily basis, hearing news of new infections and

398

unfortunate victims of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2.

399

Although several types of COVID-19 vaccines have been developed and used,

400

it is worth noting these three types of vaccines: mRNA vaccine (Moderna, Pfizer-

401

BioNTech, and Curevac), adenovirus vaccine (Oxford-AstraZeneca and Johnson &

402

Johnson) and recombinant protein vaccine (Novavax), and the governments of each

403

country are actively carrying out the vaccination. The current supply of the COVID-19

404

vaccine is limited compared to demand, and as new variants such as strains B.1.1.7,

405

P.1, B.1.427 / B.1.429 and B.1.351 (Wu et al., 2021) continue to emerge, the

406

effectiveness of existing vaccines being developed against the Wuhan strain of

407

COVID-19 is questioned. Therefore, it is necessary to develop new vaccines to meet

408

the demand for vaccines and ensure efficient vaccines against numerous variants of

409

COVID-19.

410

Since the mRNA vaccine can be developed in a relatively short time compared

411

to inactivated or recombinant protein vaccines, we initiated the development of an

412

mRNA vaccine against COVID-19 to respond to the urgent demand for vaccines and

413

the future needs of vaccines against emerging variants. In this report, we generated

414

an mRNA vaccine candidate coded for a full-length spike glycoprotein, EG-COVID,

415

European mutant strain (D614G) with 2P-3Q substitution (Bangaru et al., 2020).

416

When we initiated the development of the COVID-19 vaccine, European strains

417

started to emerge and became prevalent, so we predicted that it would be

418

appropriate to develop using the European strain rather than the Wuhan variant.

419

Furthermore, the 2P-3Q substitution is expected to show better efficacy in our study

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.22.436375; this version posted March 24, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

420

using artificial intelligence analysis and vaccine development research. Currently

421

available vaccines are mostly developed based on the Wuhan strain and all of them

422

have been reported to be less effective against the South African variants (Wu et al.,

423

2021). Our vaccine was developed based on a European variant to which the 2P-3Q

424

substitution was applied and is expected to demonstrate the efficacy against the

425

South African variant. Interestingly, Novavax’s vaccine targeting the same European

426

variant (D614G) with 2P-3Q substitution as our EG-COVID, showed 95.6%

427

effectiveness against the original variants and also for the newer variant (85.6% for

428

the UK variant B.1.1.7 and 60% for the South Africa variant B.1.351) (Mahase, 2021).

429

With this in mind, we anticipated that EG-COVID would have a similar effect against

430

the original variant and new variants as the Novavax’s vaccine.

431

The human immune system has an effective defense system when attacked by

432

viruses or bacteria. In this sense, IFN-γ plays an important role in the recognition and

433

elimination of pathogens (Kak et al, 2018). We demonstrated that immunization with

434

EG-COVID in mice induced anti-RBD (Receptor Binding Domain) antibodies and

435

SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies with two doses. Also, we found that EG-COVID

436

induced cellular immune response. Therefore, we concluded that EG-COVID

437

successfully induced virus specific adaptive immune response, which could play an

438

effective antiviral role against SARS-CoV-2. Spike protein and RBDs are the primary

439

targets of neutralizing antibodies because they prevent the virus from binding to

440

airway epithelial cells through invasion of the ACE 2 receptor (Cox et al., 2020). We

441

demonstrated EG-COVID generated neutralizing antibodies against recombinant

442

RBD protein. Since there was an approach whereby neutralizing antibodies directed

443

primarily to RBD of spike protein could be applied as a complementary option to treat

444

severe forms of COVID-19 (Assadiasl et al., 2020), the neutralizing antibody titer

445

induced by EG-COVID could be an important indicator of an effective vaccine

446

against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

447

All currently available mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are supplied in liquid form

448

and requires special cold chain for storage and transportation of the vaccines. This is

449

a factor that increases the cost of supplying the vaccines and at the same time

450

makes it difficult to distribute the vaccines. This results in the low accessibility of

451

mRNA vaccines, especially for developing countries. To overcome this, it is

452

necessary to prepare the mRNA vaccine in a form that can be stored at room

453

temperature or refrigerated at 4 C, and lyophilization is essential for this purpose. As

454

we observed in our study, EG-COVID is being developed in a form that can be

455

lyophilized and the success of our vaccine will promote equitable access to mRNA

456

vaccines worldwide, as well as establish a system that can deliver vaccines to

457

everyone who needs it in a timely manner.

In conclusion, EG-COVID is a potent and safe vaccine against SARS-CoV-2
that can be stored for a prolonged time in a conventional refrigerator.
