ABSTRACT
Diarrhea occurs in 2-50% of cases of COVID-19 (~8% is average across series). The diarrhea does not
appear to account for the disease mortality and its contribution to the morbidity has not been defined, even
though it is a component of Long Covid or post-infectious aspects of the disease. Even less is known about the
pathophysiologic mechanism of the diarrhea. To begin to understand the pathophysiology of COVID-19
diarrhea, we exposed human enteroid monolayers obtained from five healthy subjects and made from
duodenum, jejunum, and proximal colon to live SARS-CoV-2 and virus like particles (VLPs) made from
exosomes expressing SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins (Spike, Nucleocapsid, Membrane and Envelope).
Results: 1) Live virus was exposed apically for 90 min, then washed out and studied 2 and 5 days later.
SARS-Cov-2 was taken up by enteroids and live virus was present in lysates and in the apical>>basolateral
media of polarized enteroids 48 h after exposure. This is the first demonstration of basolateral appearance of
live virus after apical exposure. High vRNA concentration was detected in cell lysates and in the apical and
basolateral media up to 5 days after exposure. 2 ) Two days after viral exposure, cytokine measurements of
media showed significantly increased levels of IL-6, IL-8 and MCP-1. 3) Two days after viral exposure,
mRNA levels of ACE2, NHE3 and DRA were reduced but there was no change in mRNA of CFTR. NHE3
protein was also decreased. 4) Live viral studies were mimicked by some studies with VLP exposure for 48 h.
VLPs with Spike- D614G bound to the enteroid apical surface and was taken up; this resulted in decreased
mRNA levels of ACE2, NHE3, DRA and CFTR. 4) VLP effects were determined on active anion secretion
measured with the Ussing chamber/voltage clamp technique. S-D614G acutely exposed to apical surface of
human ileal enteroids did not alter the short-circuit current (Isc). However, VLPS- D614G exposure to
enteroids that were pretreated for ~24 h with IL-6 plus IL-8 induced a concentration dependent increase in Isc
indicating stimulated anion secretion, that was delayed in onset by ~8 min . The anion secretion was inhibited
by apical exposure to a specific calcium activated Cl channel (CaCC) inhibitor (AO1) but not by a specific
CFTR inhibitor (BP027); was inhibited by basolateral exposure to the K channel inhibit clortimazole; and was
prevented by pretreatment with the calcium buffer BAPTA-AM. 5) The calcium dependence of the VLPinduced increase in Isc was studied in Caco- 2/BBe cells stably expressing the genetically encoded Ca2+ sensor
GCaMP6s. 24 h pretreatment with IL-6/IL-8 did not alter intracellular Ca2+. However, in IL-6/IL-8 pretreated
cells, VLP S-D614G caused appearance of Ca2+waves and an overall increase in intracellular Ca2+ with a delay
of ~10 min after VLP addition. We conclude that the diarrhea of COVID-19 appears to an example of a
calcium dependent inflammatory diarrhea that involves both acutely stimulated Ca2+ dependent anion
secretion (stimulated Isc) that involves CaCC and likely inhibition of neutral NaCl absorption (decreased NHE3
protein and mRNA and decreased DRA mRNA).

INTRODUCTION
The many recognized clinical manifestations of human COVID-19 infection continue to increase both related
to the number of organ systems affected and also to the persistent manifestations that has led to the naming of
the prolonged disease, now called post-infectious-COVID-19 or Long Covid. GI manifestations, primarily
diarrhea, occur in ~2%-50% of acute cases (average ~8%), often early as the presenting complaint but can occur
throughout the course of the disease, including during the prolonged phase1-14.
GI manifestations are thought to occur from direct luminal rather than systemic contact between the virus and
the GI tract. SARS-CoV-2 can be recovered from the lumen of the intestine in spite of being acid sensitive15,16
(perhaps related to lack of gastric acid in the period between meals), where it binds and replicates in human
enterocytes. Although fecal shedding has been documented in up to 50% cases of infection, this has almost
always been looked at as viral RNA rather than live virus, the number of examples of live virus isolation of
stool is very limited, and it is unclear if this pool can transmit disease; and this is true during the acute infection
as well as during the prolonged phases of COVID-198,9,15-17. Intestinal effects of this virus are not surprising
since expression levels of the brush border SARS-CoV-2 receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is
among the very highest in the human body, being 10-fold higher in intestinal cells than lung cells16,18,19. ACE2
is present in the brush border (BB) of enterocytes with the highest concentration in the ileum and much less in
the colon and more in the villus than the crypts18.19. Intestinal infection by SARS-CoV-2 appears to involve
enterocytes with ACE2 not present in goblet cells14.
Our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 pathophysiology in intestinal cells involves a dysregulated, aberrant host
innate immune response, similar to the response in lung epithelial cells that is characterized by reduced Type I
and III interferon (IFN) levels with increased chemokine/cytokine responses20-25. There is current uncertainty
concerning the role of cytokine storm in the COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the
role of the inflammatory response in the multiple manifestations of COVID-19. The cytokine response in
COVID-19, including the ARDS, is associated with activation of a wide range of pathways, but with lower
cytokine levels than in other forms of ARDS. In addition, there is lack of clarity about which cytokines cause
symptoms or organ damage in COVID-19, although there is elevation of IL-6 and IL-8 26-28, A.Cox, unpublished.
Important gaps in understanding effects of SARS-Cov-2 on the intestine include lack of adequate clinical
descriptions. Unknown characteristics include when in the course of COVID-19 the diarrhea occurs, intestinal
site affected, whether the diarrhea is osmotic or secretory, and contribution to morbidity. Equally not
understood are mechanistic insights into how the virus causes diarrhea and if and how the inflammatory
response that is part of COVID-19 contributes to producing the diarrhea. Also unknown is the role of the GI
tract in the many clinical aspects of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including viral replication and disease progression.
The current studies make use of a human enteroid model exposed to live virus as well as to two forms of SARSCoV-2 virus- like particles (VLPs), one of which is competent for ACE2 binding but not fusion, while the other
is competent for both receptor binding and membrane fusion/endocytosis. The enteroid model, studied as
monolayers, has been used for understanding other host-pathogen interactions and allows the equivalent of
luminal pathogen exposure to a model of normal human intestine 13-15,29,30.

RESULTS

SARS-CoV-2 infects and replicates in human enteroid and colonoid monolayers without compromising
the epithelial layer integrity.

Initial studies were carried out to confirm human enteroid monolayer expression of ACE2 and viral infection
and replication. Differentiated proximal colonic enteroid monolayers expressed ACE2 in the apical surface by
IF with expression in colonocytes but not goblet cells. Goblet cells marked by trefoil factor 3 lacked ACE2 (Fig
1A).
Whether human enteroid monolayers could be infected apically with SARS-CoV-2 and whether viral
replication occurs in these enterocytes was examined using intestinal segments with lower ACE2 than the ileal
expression. Differentiated human proximal colonic and duodenal enteroid monolayers were exposed apically
to 105 pfu SARS-CoV-2 in 100 µl (this is the form viral concentrations is presented in this report) for 90 min,
then the monolayers were washed and examined at 48 h by IF for presence of Spike protein, viral replication
via dsRNA, and presence of live virus in apical and basolateral fluid bathing the enteroids and in enteroid
lysates. Shown in Fig 1B, in proximal colonic enteroids (similar results in duodenal enteroids), Spike protein
was diffusely present in all enterocytes and particularly in the supranuclear area; while viral dsRNA was
present, although in a much more focal distribution, indicating that replication did not occur in all enterocytes
in which Spike protein entered. These studies were prolonged for 5 days after a single initial 90 min SARSCoV-2 exposure (Fig 1B/C). SARS-CoV-2 RNA was present at day 5 in enteroid lysates from duodenum and
colon and was also present in the apical and basolateral media. Transepithelial movement of FITC-dextran was
measured to determine whether disruption of the enteroid junctional complexes and the accompanying increase
in intestinal permeability accounted for presence of basolateral SARS-CoV-2. Studied 48 h after viral apical
exposure, there was no change in apical to basolateral movement of 10 and 70 kDa-FITC-dextran compared to
untreated control enteroids, indicating no change in intestinal permeability with SARS-CoV-2 exposure. These
results support that virus moves from the lumen to the basolateral surface through the epithelial cells, which is
the site of the intestinal capillaries and lymphatics. These results are also consistent with the lack of intestinal
epithelial pathology detected in 19 COVID-19 patients when examined at the light microscopic level, although
studies are limited until now 2,7,22,31 .
SARS-CoV-2 infection of enteroids causes secretion of proinflammatory cytokines from human enteroid
monolayers.
COVID-19 is characterized by increased levels of circulating cytokines/chemokines that are responsible for
at least some of the severe clinical manifestations. Recent studies have begun to characterize the innate
epithelial response of human enteroids to SARS-CoV-2 infection14-16,20-25 . We evaluated the human enteroid
monolayers for changes in SARS-CoV-2 induced cytokine/chemokine production/secretion. SARS-CoV-2
infection of human duodenal enteroids for 90 min induced significant increases in basolateral secretion of
cytokines IL-6, IL-8, and the chemokine, MCP-1 (Fig. 2) when collected 48 h after viral exposure. Intestinal
cells of COVID-19 patients almost certainly have prolonged exposure to increased concentrations of
cytokines/chemokines given both this local release and the increased systemic concentrations. To begin to
mimic the effect of the prolonged inflammation, we exposed live virus to human enteroid monolayers primed
by 24 hour basolateral exposure to the pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-6 and IL-8. Under these conditions, the
epithelial response to SARS-CoV-2 was also significantly increased for TNF-α and IL-1β, further suggesting
that the infected intestinal epithelium may contribute to the elevated circulating cytokine levels as well as to the
local intestinal environment as part of COVID-19.
SARS-CoV-2-infection of human enterocytes alters expression of ACE2, NHE3 and DRA.
Most diarrheal diseases increase stool water by inhibiting the neutral NaCl absorptive process, which is made
up of linked neutral exchange proteins, SLC9A3 (the Na/H exchanger NHE3) and SLC26A3 (the Cl/HCO3
exchanger DRA) with or without stimulating the Cl secretory process. To test whether COVID-19 related
diarrhea occurs by changes in these transport processes, live SARS-CoV-2 virus was exposed apically to
colonoid monolayers for 90 min, and effects on mRNA expression of NHE3, DRA, and CFTR as well as
ACE2 were determined using enteroid lysates generated 48 h post-infection. SARS-CoV-2 significantly
decreased mRNA levels of NHE3, DRA, as well as ACE2, while CFTR mRNA was unaffected. (Fig. 3A). To
determine whether these changes occurred at the protein level, the NHE3 expression pattern was examined in

colonoid monolayers by IF/confocal microscopy 48 h after viral exposure (Fig 3B,C). The total and the BB
amounts of NHE3 were reduced. While ~90% of NHE3 under basal conditions is present in the enterocyte
apical surface, after SARS-CoV-2 exposure the percent remaining appeared to be more reduced in the apical
membrane than in the intracellular pool. These results suggest that at least part of the diarrhea of COVID-19 is
due to reduced intestinal NaCl absorption.

Virus Like Particles (VLPs) that include Spike cause inflammation and reduce transporter expression in
human ileal enteroids.
SARS-CoV-2 infection involves numerous distinct but overlapping pathologic events. To better understand
the different stages of the virus-host interaction, we generated virus-like particles (VLPs) expressing the 4 main
structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2: Spike, Nucleocapsid, Membrane, and Envelope in artificial exosomes
(small extracellular vesicles). Moreover, two different types of SARS-CoV-2 VLPs were generated, one that
expresses the D614G form of Spike present in most current infections, and one that expresses an S-2PP form of
Spike that is competent for ACE2-binding but it unable to catalyze fusion between the VLP and cell
membranes. As expected, added at time zero and 24 h and sampled at 48 h after initial VLP exposure, S-2PP
bound to the enteroid apical surface without evidence of intracellular presence while S-D614G was present both
on the surface of the enteroid monolayers and intracellularly (Fig 4A).
Since VLPs designed from other viruses can induce cytokine responses (in the absence of replication)32, we
hypothesized that direct binding of VLPs to intestinal epithelial cells could induce a cytokine/chemokine
response. 48 h after apical exposure of ileal enteroid monolayers at time 0 and 24 h to 106 VLPs, basolateral
fluid was analyzed for cytokines. Compared to control exosomes from the same cell line (293F), addition of
both forms of SARS-CoV-2 VLPs significantly increased IL-8 and MCP-1 and also increased IL-6 and TNF-,
although the latter two did not reach statistical significance (Fig 4B). Importantly there were no differences
between extent of increase caused by Spike binding without entry and Spike binding plus intracellular entry. In
addition, VLP effects were determined on the expression of ACE2, NHE3, DRA and CFTR in the same
enteroids.
In contrast to effects on cytokine release, there were differences in mRNA expression of ACE2 and transport
proteins based on whether VLPs entered the enteroids (Fig 5). Exposure to the fusion incompetent VLPs failed
to induce any change in ACE2, DRA or CFTR mRNA and led to only a small decrease in NHE3 message. In
contrast, the fusion competent VLPs reduced ACE2, NHE3, DRA and CFTR expression. These were
qualitatively similar effects to changes caused by live viral exposure (compare Fig 3A), with additional
inhibition of CFTR mRNA. These data suggest that direct binding of VLPs can induce an epithelial cytokine
response, which appears to reflect Spike-receptor binding, while fusion competent VLPs lead to additional
changes in transport protein and ACE2 expression, even in the absence of viral RNA or viral replication, with
all effects mediated by the SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins ( S,M,E,N) entering the cell via VLP-cell fusion.
VLPs cause an inflammatory diarrhea phenotype inducing human ileal enteroid active anion secretion by
a Ca2+ dependent mechanism that involves CaCC.
The VLP-mediated reduction in expression of mRNA for NHE3 and DRA indicates that virus cell binding,
fusion, and uptake in the absence of viral replication and production of additional viral proteins may be
sufficient to reduce NaCl absorption that is likely to be contributing to the COVID-19 diarrhea. We next tested
the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 stimulated Cl secretion and that COVID-19 diarrhea was a secretory diarrhea;
this hypothesis was in part based on occurrence of diarrhea in some COVID-19 patients who were intubated and
not eating. To evaluate VLP effects on active anion secretion, ileal monolayers were studied using the Ussing
chamber /voltage clamp technique that measures active electrogenic ion transport, which in diarrheal diseases

represents anion secretion, particularly Cl secretion. As shown in Fig 6, studies were performed by addition to
the apical surface of VLPs expressing the S-D614G protein. Addition of 108 VLP x3 did not alter Isc (Fig 6A);
these enteroids however had rapid increase in Isc with 10 µM forskolin addition (elevates cAMP), indicating the
viability of the enteroids. Apical addition of the same concentration of VLPs expressing the S-2PP Spike
protein also failed to alter the Isc (Fig 6A). However, given the presence of inflammatory mediators in
enteroids exposed to both intact virus and VLP, these studies were repeated with 18-24 h pretreatment with
basolateral IL-6 plus IL-8. In the presence of Il-6/IL-8, addition of either VLP apically caused a concentration
dependent increase in Isc which occurred both after the third addition of 108 VLPs (data not shown) or a single
addition of 3x108 VLP. Shown in Fig 6B-i-v is the D614G Spike protein stimulation of Cl- secretion indicated
by the increase in Isc. This was a consistent response with the S-D614G VLP, occurring in 21/23 monolayers
tested but was less consistent with the S-2PP VLP, with a change in Isc only occurring n 5/10 monolayers. This
IL-6/IL-8 dependent secretion had the following characteristics: a) delayed onset of 7.6 ± 2.7 min (n=5
experiments); b) the increase in Isc was inhibited by the CaCC inhibitor, AO1; c) there was no effect on the Isc
response by treatment with the CFTR inhibitor BPO-27; d) the entire Isc response was reversed by basolateral
addition of the K+ channel inhibitor, clotrimazole. K channels are required to maintain the electrical driving
force for Cl secretion and these data support that the increase in Isc represents electrogenic anion secretion; e)
the increase in Isc was almost entirely prevented by pretreatment with the intracellular calcium buffer BAPTAAM (pretreatment 35 mM, 30 min), although after a significant delay some increase in Isc occurred. The last
finding is initial evidence of the dependence of VLP-induced anion secretion on an elevation of intracellular
Ca2+ .
VLPs cause an increase in intracellular Ca2+ with a time course similar to that of the VLP stimulation of
Cl secretion.
To further support a role for intracellular Ca2+ in the VLP stimulation of intestinal Cl secretion, the effect of
VLP S-D614G was determined on intracellular Ca2+ detected by the Ca2+ sensor GCaMP6s stably expressed in
polarized Caco-2/BBE cells. Using a confocal microscope/environmental chamber to maintain the temperature
at 37°C, intracellular Ca2+ was determined over the same time course and using the same concentrations of IL6/IL-8 and apical VLP D614G under which the VLPs altered the Isc in enteroids . Four experimental
conditions were compared: VLP effect in the absence and presence of IL-6/IL-8 pretreatment; IL-6/IL-8
treatment alone and time control. Shown in Fig 7, Caco-2 cell Ca2+ did not change significantly over the time
of the experiment. There was also minimal change in intracellular Ca2+ in Caco-2 cells exposed only to IL6/Il-8
overnight (50ng/ml), while a slightly greater increase in Ca2+ occurred with VLP S-D614G treatment alone. In
contrast, in Caco-2 cells exposed to IL-6/IL-8 overnight, VLP D614G cause a sustained increase in intracellular
Ca2+ that had a delay in time of onset after VLP addition of 9.9 ±1.2 min (n=5 experiments). This is not
significantly different than the delay in onset of increased Isc after apical VLP addition. Additionally,
intercellular Ca2+ waves (ICWs) spreading over multiple cells were detected after VLP S-D614G in the VLP
alone and IL-6/IL-8-VLP conditions , suggesting cell to cell signaling. These occurred over a prolonged period,
were not seen in the untreated time control or IL-6/IL-8 alone conditions and seems to occur with similar
frequency in the VLP and VLP after IL-6/IL-8 condition.

Enteroid and Colonoid Cultures. Human duodenal and ileal enteroids, and ascending colonic enteroids
(colonoids) were derived from intestinal biopsies obtained from normal, healthy donors, as previously described
[refs]. Briefly, human enteroids/colonoids were maintained as 3D spheroids in Matrigel in enteroid expansion
media containing the growth factors Wnt3a, R-spondin-1, noggin, and EGF necessary for long-term culture
[refs]. Enteroid/colonoid monolayers were generated by seeding enteroids/colonoids isolated from Matrigel and
fragmented by enzymatic digestion onto 24-well Tranwell inserts (Corning #3470), as described in detail33.
Results were all from studies on human enteroids or colonoids grown as confluent monolayers on Transwell
filters, as we have reported previously33-39. Generation and study of human enteroids were approved by the
IRBs of JHU SOM (NA_00038329) and Un New Mexico School of Medicine (18-171). Data were obtained
from 1 duodenal enteroid line, 2 ileal enteroid lines, and 3 colonic enteroid lines.
Caco-2/BBE Culture and GCaMP6s Expression. Caco-2/BBe cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified
Eagle Medium (DMDM) supplemented with 25 mM NaHCO3, 0.1 mM non essential amino acids, 10% fetal
bovine serum, 4 mM glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 ug/ml streptomycin in a 5% CO2/95% air
atmosphere at 37C Plasmid GP-CMV-GCaMP6s (Addgene plasmid # 40753) was cloned into lentiviral vector
pCDH-EF1-MCS-IRES (puro) and lentiviral particles produced. Caco-2 wild-type cells were transduced the the
GCaMP6s lentiviral particles and puromycin selected (10 mg/ml). Caco-2 cells stably expressing GCaMP6s
were transduced with lentiviral particles produced from lentiviral vector pLV-EF1aa IRES-3HA-CHRM3
(Blasticidin), as described40. These Caco-2 cells were maintained under puromycin plus blasticidn containing
Caco-2 media. For calcium imaging, these Caco-2 cells were seeded in 12-well Transwell plates (1.2 x105
cells/well) and grown for 12-15 days post confluency; they were serum starved 2-3 h before study.
VLP-producing cell lines. 293F cells were transfected with pS149 and selected in zeocin-containing media,
creating the cell line Ftet1, which constitutively expresses the rtTAv16 Tet-on transcription factor from a CMV
promoter-driven bicistronic ORF, upstream of a viral peptide and the bleomycin resistance gene. Htet1 cells
were converted to SARS-CoV-2 VLP-producing cell lines Ftet1/S226 and Ftet1/CG201 by transfection with
Sleeping Beauty transposons that carry 5 separate genes: (1) a puromycin-resistance gene under control of a
minimal EF1alpha promoter; (2) SARS-CoV-2 Envelope gene under control of the tetracycline/doxycyclineinducible TRE3G promoter; (3) SARS-CoV-2 Membrane gene under control of the TRE3G promoter; (4)
SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid gene under control of the TRE3G promoter; and either (5a) he SARS-CoV-2
Spike-2PP-CSM gene under control of the TRE3G promoter (pS226) or (5b) the SARS-CoV-2 Spike/D614G
gene under control of the TRE3G promoter (pCG201) (Spike-2PP-CSM encodes a protein identical to Spike
encoded by the Wuhan-1 strain of SARS-CoV-2, with the exception of diproline and cleavage site mutations
(986KV987-986PP987 and 682RRAR685-to-682GSAG685); Spike-D614G encodes a protein identical to Spike
encoded by the Wuhan-1 strain of SARS-CoV-2 with the exception of the D614G substitution mutation). To
generate SARS-CoV-2 VLPs carrying the non-fusogenic yet receptor-binding S-2P-CSM protein, Ftet1/S226
cells were grown in suspension cultures in Freestyle media in the presence of 1 ug/ml doxycycline for 3-4 days.
To generate SARS-CoV-2 VLPs carrying the fusogenic, functional Spike-D614G protein, Ftet1/CG201 cells
were grown in suspension cultures in Freestyle media in the presence of 1 ug/ml doxycycline for 3-4 days.
Starting cell densities were between 0.5-1 x 10^6 cells/ml and the cells were grown in sterile, baffled
Erlenmeyer culture flasks at 110 rpm in a humidified, 37oC incubator containing 5% CO2.

VLP purification & characterization. VLPs were purified from Ftet1/S226 and Ftet1/CG201 suspension cell
cultures by the following protocol. In brief, cells were removed by centrifugation (5,000 x g for 10 min) and the
resulting supernatants were sterilized by gravity filtration through a 220 nm pore diameter filtration, generating
clarified tissue culture supernatants. The VLPs were then concentrated ~300-fold by centrifugal filtration of
each CTCS across a 100 kDa cutoff membrane (~160 mls CTCS to a volume of ~0.5 ml). The concentrated
VLP-containing suspension was then separated by size exclusion chromatography and VLP-containing fractions
were collected, pooled, and quantified by nanoparticle tracking analysis using a ParticleMetrix Zetaview camera
according to the manufacturer's instructions. VLP identity was confirmed by immunoblot using antibodies
specific for Spike, Membrane, and Envelope.
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR. Presence of SARS-CoV-2 in enteroids and colonoids, as well as in
apical and basolateral media were determined using primers and probes (N1, N2 and RP) from the CDC 2019
Real-time Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR diagnostic panel (IDT). Positive controls used in these reactions
included SARS-CoV-2 RNA (WA1-USA strain, from UTMB) as well as the 2019-nCoV-N and the Hs-RPP30
control plasmids (IDT). RT-qPCR were performed using TaqPath 1-step RT-qPCR master mix (ThermoFisher)
on the ABI StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR system. Reverse transcription and amplification conditions were 25oC
for 2 min, 50oC for 15 min, 95oC for 2 min followed by 45 cycles of 95oC for 3 sec and 55oC for 30 sec
Plaque Assay. SARS-CoV-2 plaque assays in Vero E6 cells were used to assess viral replication. Vero E6 cells
were incubated in a 24 well plate until they reached 90% confluency. Supernatant from cultures were mixed
with media and added to cells for 2 hours. The supernatant was removed and the cells were overlaid with virus
overlay media comprised of equal volumes of a) minimal essential medium/5% FCS/2X antibiotics and b) 2%
agarose. After 2 days the overlay was removed, cells were stained with crystal violet, and plaques were
counted.
Enteroid/Colonoid Infection. Confluent enteroid/colonoid monolayers were studied in the undifferentiated
state in the presence of conditioned med with Wnt3a, R-spondin1 and noggin and in the differentiated state , 5
days after removal of Wnt, R-spondin1, and noggin, as reported 38,39. Enteroids were inoculated apically with
either 105 or 106 live SARS-CoV-2 virus (isolate USAWA1/ 2020 SARS-CoV-2; BEI Resources; D Spike
protein) for 90 min.; apical media was replaced by virus free media and the infection was monitored for up to 5
days. For studies with VLPs, apical exposure was with 106 or 108 VLPs .
Cytokine Assays. Cytokine/chemokine levels were assayed using the U-Plex Human Biomarker Group 1 (Cat
#: K15067L-1, MesoScale Diagnostics. Wells were washed 3 times with MSD Wash Buffer before incubation
with detection antibody solution for 1 hour at room temperature, with shaking. Wells were washed again 3
times before adding 150μl of Read Buffer T to each well. Measurements were obtained on MESO Quickplex
SQ 120 Imager using Discover Workbench 4.0 software (MesoScale Diagnostics).
Ussing Chamber/Voltage Clamp Studies. Ileal monolayers were grown on Transwell inserts and were
maintained in the undifferentiated state. These ileal monolayers were switched overnight to CMGF negative
medium (Advanced DMEM/F12 medium containing GlutaMAX (2 mmol/L) and HEPES (10 mmol/L)) either
with or without 50ng/ml each of IL-6 and IL-8 . On the day of experiments, these Transwell inserts were
mounted in Ussing chambers (Physiological Instruments, San Diego, CA). The apical and basolateral
hemichambers were filled with buffer that was gassed continuously with 95% O2/5% CO2, maintained at 37oC,
and connected to a voltage clamp apparatus (Physiological Instruments) via Ag/AgCl electrodes and 3 mol/L
KCl agar bridges. Krebs–Ringer bicarbonate buffer consisted of 115 mmol/L NaCl, 25 mmol/L NaHCO3, 0.4
mmol/L KH2PO4, 2.4 mmol/L K2HPO4, 1.2 mmol/L CaCl2, 1.2 mmol/L MgCl2, pH 7.4. In addition, buffer in
the basolateral hemichamber was supplemented with 4 mmol/L glucose as an energy substrate; buffer in the
apical hemichamber was supplemented with 4 mmol/L mannitol to maintain the osmotic balance. To investigate
the effect of VLP S-D614G and S-2PP on anion secretion, VLPs were added to the apical hemichamber with a

of CaCC, CFTR and K channels in VLP D614G stimulated Isc response were studied with a CaCC inhibitor
(CaCCinh-A01 20mmol/ml), a CFTR inhibitor (BPO-27, 1µmol/ml) and a K channel blocker (clotrimazole
30mmol/ml), respectively. Effect of BAPTAM-AM (25 uMm, 20 min) pretreated was determined with 25 min
preincubation
Intracellular Ca2+ Measurements withGCaMP6s. Live images of GCaMP fluorescence for intracellular
Ca2+ measuring were made using the Caco-2/M3 receptor/GcAMP6s monolayers using an Olympus FV3000R
confocal microscope (10x objective lens; 2.00x digital zoom; resonant scan with 16 frame average; 0.3 um step
size; pinhole 2.3 Airy units, na=0.40) at 37C within a sealed environmental chamber (OkoLab stage top plus
transparent shroud incubator) and the associated fluoView (FV31S, v2.1.1.98) acquisition software. Time lapse
images were taken approximately once every 3 seconds for 60 minutes. Average fluorescence for the entire
frame was generated in MetaMorph Basic (v7.7.3.0) and transferred to Microsoft Excel for normalization
before being transferred to Prism 8/9 for graphing and analysis.
Statistical Analyses. Experiments were generally repeated three times and tested for statistical significance
with Student’s paired or unpaired t tests or via ANOVA when three or more comparisons were carried out. p
values of <0.05 were consider statistically significant.

DISCUSSION
While diarrhea is known to occur as a significant clinical component of COVID-19 including acute and long
term consequences, little known about the pathophysiology. In fact, studies in animal models, as recently
reviewed, and summaries of human disease indicate lack of mechanistic insights12-14. The few studies using
human enteroids have begun to provide some insights into the pathophysiology and these current studies have
confirmed some of the previous enteroid findings and extend mechanistic understanding of the pathophysiology
of COVID-19 diarrhea14-,16. Importantly, the current studies indicate that the transport effects appear to be the
same inhibition of intestinal Na absorption and stimulation of Cl secretion that has been documented to occur in
most diarrheal diseases41-43 although unique aspects have been revealed. The diarrhea of COVID-19 is the first
example of a viral diarrhea that is dependent on the inflammatory response that is part of the disease. The
transport processes affected include inhibition of the NaCl absorptive proteins NHE3 and DRA and stimulation
of Cl secretion that includes activation of CaCC by a mechanism the is dependent on elevation of intracellular
Ca2+ which was shown to occur with a time course similar to the time course of the stimulation of active Cl
secretion.
The models used in these studies, of human enteroids and colonoids made from healthy human subjects
confirmed some previous conclusions using human enteroids. Supporting previous reports, ACE2 expression
was present in the apical domain of enteroids made from both small intestine and colon, and was present in
both undifferentiated crypt like enteroids as well as differentiated villus like and colon surface cell like
epithelial cells but was not present in goblet cells. As reported previously, there was uptake of SARS-CoV-2
and replication in enterocytes measured 48 h after an initial exposure, supporting prolonged viral replication in
enterocytes14,15,41 . As the result of the viral replication, large amounts of viral particles were secreted apically
and basolaterally over 5 days of infection2,7,22,31. Consistent with previous reports on human intestinal tissue
from COVID-19 patients, that intestinal histology is not disrupted by SARS-CoV-2 infection, intestinal
permeability measured by transcellular movement of dextran of several sizes was not altered by live viral entry,
replication and secretion; this also supports the transcellular movement of SARS-CoV-2 across the epithelium
rather than through the paracellular pathway. The apical-to-basolateral surface gradient of secreted virus further
support its transcellular secretion route, since increased paracellular movement would lead to similar

concentrations on both surfaces. Importantly, live virus was shown to be present in enterocytes 48 h after initial
exposure and live virus also present in apical and in one enteroid culture in the basolateral surface, further
supporting patient specific viral distribution31. The fact that it is live virus that is present, extends previous EM
documentation of virus on the basolateral surface, although that study did not require the virus to be capable of
further replication 16. Since the intestinal mucosal capillaries and lymphatics are present at the base of the
epithelial cells, just where live virus (and viral particles) emerges from the basolateral surface of the
enterocytes, these results for the first time provide evidence for the possibility that intestinal infection by
SARS-CoV-2 is involved in systemic entry of virus via the GI tract, and support that basolateral viral particles
(live or not) might contribute to the widespread damage that is part of COVID-19 . However, since systemic
infection as part of COVID-19 is not felt to be an important part of the pathophysiology of this disease, the
clinical relevance of this observation remains undefined.
Further supporting previous studies of COVID-19 pathophysiology, is the increase in cytokine/chemokine
release from enterocytes. The inflammatory response in COVID-19, that has now been described in several
serial observations over the course of the illness, is complex and involves multiple inflammatory pathways26-28,
A Cox., unpublished.
Our data suggest that viral replication is not necessary for the production of at least several
clinically relevant cytokines with the source being the epithelial cells. Furthermore, we showed that the initial
pool of cytokines produced by the epithelial cells are capable of further stimulating viral cytokine production,
thus contributing to the accumulating cytokine storm seen in COVID-19. However, we only examined a subset
of cytokines shown to be elevated in patients with COVID-19 and our studies were only limited to 48 after
initial viral exposure; thus further determinations are needed to define the contributionof intestinal epithelial
cells to the inflammatory response seen during the full course of COVID-19 .
The changes in transport as part of COVID-19 demonstrated here include 1) reduced expression of NHE3
and DRA which make up neutral NaCl absorption, the major way Na is absorbed from the intestine in the
period between meals. The amount of NHE3 was shown to be reduced both at the mRNA and protein level. In
addition, the reduced amount of NHE3 seemed to be more of the NHE3 in the brush border compared to the
intracellular pool, which suggests that in addition to the reduced total NHE3 amount there was also a change in
NHE3 trafficking. NHE3 normally trafficks continually between the brush border and recycling compartment
and much of its normal regulation is by protein kinase dependent changes in rates of endo and exocytosis.
Further studies will be required to define the role of changes in trafficking of NHE3 and potentially DRA to the
diarrhea of COVID-19. 2) stimulated Cl secretion. VLPs induce stimulated Cl secretion by a Ca2+ dependent
mechanism (prevented by pretreatment with BAPTA-AM), that is delayed with a time course that fits the time
for the VLP-induced increase in intracellular Ca2+. The VLP effect most consistently required both binding and
uptake into the enterocyte, although a less consistent stimulation of Cl secretion occurred with Spike binding
alone. This indicates that Cl secretion can occur without the presence of intracellular viral RNA or involvement
of other than the viral structural proteins; although whether live virus further induces changes in Cl secretion by
the same or different mechanisms than that caused by the VLPs has not been evaluated. One aspect that requires
further clarification is the contribution of CFTR. Live virus exposure to the same enteroids used for the VLP
studies was not associated with changes in CFTR mRNA, while S-D614G VLP caused a decrease; since the
VLP stimulation of Cl secretion did not involve CFTR, similar studies with live virus are required to determine
if CFTR contributes to SARS-CoV-2 induced Cl secretion. It is worth noting, however, that while CFTR is the
major contributor to secretory diarrheas like cholera, it appears to play less of a role or not to be stimulated in
inflammatory diarrheas42-44, which appears to characterize the diarrhea induced by SARS-CoV-2. While these
results implicate a calcium activated chloride channel (CaCC) in COVID-19 diarrhea, we have not defined
which isoform is involved; transport has only been characterized in ileum, and it is likely that different CaCCs
are involved in anion secretion in different intestinal segments. The mechanism of the demonstrated elevated
intracellular Ca2+ has not been clarified and represents an important area for further study.

The mechanism of COVID-19 diarrhea appears to require the molecular interplay among inflammatory
cytokines, the viral receptor, and several apical and basolateral ion transport proteins as well as activation of
intracellular Ca2+ signaling (Fig 8). The changes in Na and Cl transporters with SARS-CoV-2 required the
related inflammatory environment, modeled by exposure to IL-6/IL-8. This was necessary but not sufficient to
induce the changes. Neither IL-6 nor IL-8 elevate intracellular Ca2+, based on multiple previous as well as the
current measurements, although one or both along with elevated Ca2+ were necessary for the VLP stimulated
Cl secretion. The role of the COVID-19 inflammation and elevated intracellular Ca2+ is less clear for NHE3
regulation and additional studies will be required to define the role of the complex inflammatory state of
COVID-19 and the changes that occur during the multiple stages of the disease on Na and Cl transport .
Moreover, the transport protein studies have not included all the transporters potentially affected in COVID-19.
For instance ACE2 interacts with a brush border amino acid tansporter, SLC6A19 (BoaTi)45; and both short
and long term changes in ACE2 in COVID-19 could alter amino acid absorption, with potential nutritional
implications, especially for the prolonged aspects of this disease. In addition, even though characterization of
the changes in Na and Cl transport which occur throughout COVID-19 are incomplete, the results obtained
already suggest potential drug targets , while mechanistic insights may be relevant to SARS-CoV-2 effects on
other epithelial cells.
To better understand the relationship between viral infection and possible pathophysiologic mechanisms of
diarrhea, we used the STRING functional protein association network to model the potential physical and/or
functional molecular links between virus receptor ACE2, proinflammatory cytokines elevated in the intestinal
epithelium due to viral infection ,and the virus-modulated ion transporters as well as their interacting partners
(Figure 8). Our model suggest that IL-6 functionally interacts with ACE2 and CFTR and these interactions
affect NHE3 and DRA, and to a less extent, SLC6A19. IL-8 (CXCL8) might affect the ion transporters
similarly to IL-6, through direct interactions with IL-6 and CFTR . This model also suggests that ACE2 binding
to calmodulin46 and calmodulin association with NHE3 might provide insights into at least part of the Ca2+
signaling involvement in COVID-19 diarrhea. While a role for CFTR in the COVID-19 diarrhea has not been
identified, the current studies have shown that Cl secretion occurs through one or more CaCCs. Shown in Fig 8,
ACE2 through the interactions with NHE3 is predicted to transduce the IL-6 signaling to SLC26A6 (PAT-1), a
small intestinal apical Cl-/bicarbonate exchanger present in the small intestine particularly in the proximal
small intestine, which potentially could take part in activation of ANO1. This bioinformatics based model
requires testing and PAT-1 plays a minor role in distal small intestinal transposrt in which the VLP studies of
ion transport were performed. This model suggests that both CFTR and CaCCs might contribute to SARS-CoV2-induced Cl- secretion and intracellular Ca2+ flux could be modulated by ACE2 signaling. Additionally,
several basolateral K-channels are predicted to be involved in this viral diarrhea. We suggest that this model
might be of use as a roadmap to further experimentally examine the disruption of intestinal transport that
contributes to the pathophysiology of COVID-19 diarrhea.

Fig 8 Modeling the molecular mechanisms of SARS-Cov-2 induced diarrhea using a functional interactome
created from a small number of proteins that are known to be modulated by the viral infection of human
intestinal epithelium (https://string-db.org/). This analysis is based on the most inclusive gene ontology
transport pathway (GO:0006810; false discovery rate (FDR) = 2.30e-07); magenta) and includes 21
functionally and physically interacting proteins that are potentially involved in virus-induced signaling that
triggers the Isc response in human intestinal epithelium. This model indicates that NHE3 plays a central role in
signal transduction between GO:0070102 - the interleukin-6-mediated signaling pathway (red; false discovery
rate (FDR)= 4.08e-0 ) and GO:1902476 - chloride secretion (green, FDR = 5.96e-0). This cross-talk between
interleukins and Cl secretion might be mediated by PAT-1 in a CFTR-independent or -dependent manner,
leading to ANO1 activation. NHE3 is also crucial for the signal transduction from virus receptor ACE2 via
intracellular calcium stores to a membrane Cl/bicarbonate transporter and basolateral voltage-gated potassium
