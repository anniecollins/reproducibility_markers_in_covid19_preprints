Abstract

31

SARS-CoV-2 emerged by the end of 2019 to rapidly spread in 2020. At present, it is of utmost

32

importance to understand the virus biology and to rapidly assess the potential of existing drugs

33

and develop new active compounds. While some animal models for such studies are under

34

development, most of the research is carried out in the Vero E6 cells. Here, we propose fully

35

differentiated human airway epithelium cultures as a model for studies on the SARS-CoV-2.

36

Further, we also provide basic characteristics of the system.

Introduction

41

Coronaviruses constitute a large family of RNA viruses that infect mainly mammals and

42

birds. In humans, there are four species associated with mild-to-moderate respiratory infections.

43

While these viruses are present in the human population for a long time, they are believed to

44

enter the human population in a zoonotic event, and one may speculate that they may have

45

caused epidemics similar to the one observed for the SARS-CoV-2. Time to the most recent

46

ancestor analysis suggests that human coronavirus HCoV-NL63 is the oldest species in humans,

47

followed by its cousin HCoV-229E and two betacoronaviruses, which emerged in humans in a

48

relatively near past1,2, 3,4. In the 21st century, we already faced the emergence of the three novel

49

coronaviruses in humans, of which SARS-CoV disappeared after one season never to come

50

back, and MERS-CoV never fully crossed the species border, as its transmission between

51

humans is highly ineffective5,6,7. The 2019 zoonotic transmission, however, resulted in the

52

emergence of a novel human coronavirus, which seems to carry an optimal set of features

53

allowing for its rapid spread with considerable mortality. Whether the virus will become

54

endemic in humans is an open question8,9,10.

55

At present, the studies on the virus are carried out using a surrogate system based on the

56

immortalized simian Vero E6 cell line11. While this model is convenient for diagnostics and

57

testing of some antiviral drugs, it has serious limitations and does not allow for the

58

understanding of virus biology and evolution. To make an example, the entry route of human

59

coronaviruses varies between the cell lines and differentiated tissue, not mentioning the immune

60

responses or virus-host interactions12,13,14.

61

Here we used the fully differentiated epithelium cultures to study the infection with the

62

novel human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. We observed an efficient replication of the virus in

63

the tissue, with the maximal replication at 2 days post-infection. At the time of the study no

64

antibodies were available. Therefore we developed immuno-FISH to show that the virus infects

65

primarily ciliated cells of the respiratory epithelium.

66
67

Results and discussion

68

The HAE cultures reconstitute the tissue lining the conductive airways of humans. Fully

69

differentiated, are among the best tools for studying the viral infection in a natural

70

microenvironment15. These air-liquid interphase cultures contain a number of cell types (e.g.,

71

basal, ciliated, and goblet). At the same time, they also functionally reflect the natural tissue

72

with extensive crosstalk and production of protective mucus and surfactant proteins16,17,18. The

73

cultures were previously shown by us and others to be superior to the standard cell lines in

74

terms of ability to support coronaviral replication of the HCoV-HKU1, but also as a model to

75

study the biology of the infection19. To make an example, human coronaviruses were shown

76

some time ago to use a very different entry pathway in immortalized cell lines and in the natural

77

human epithelium. While in the first one they enter via pH-dependent endocytic pathway, in

78

the latter one they utilize surface serine proteases as TMPRSS2 or kallikreins for activation and

79

the fusion occurs on the cell surface. This may have grave consequences not only for the basic

80

science, but also the antiviral drug development12,13,14,20.

81

Here we verified whether HAE cultures may be used to study the SARS-CoV-2 infection

82

and identified the cellular targets in the tissue. First, the HAE cultures were inoculated with the

83

SARS-CoV-2 stock and cultured for 5 days. Every day (days 0-4) the apical and basolateral

84

release of the virus was evaluated with the RT-qPCR and the results for the apical release of

85

the virus are presented in Figure 1.

Figure 1. SARS-CoV-2 replicates in HAE cultures. Replication of SARS-CoV-2 was evaluated using
an RT-qPCR, and the data are presented as RNA copy number per ml. The experiment was
carried out in triplicate, and average values with standard deviation are presented.

91

Clearly, the increase in virus titer on the apical side is visible already 24 h post-inoculation,

92

to reach the plateau at 48 h post-inoculation. We did not observe any release of the virus from

93

the basolateral side of the HAE culture and therefore we do not show the relevant data on the

94

graph. The results we observe are consistent with the previously reported polarity of the HAE

95

cultures and apical infection / apical release reported previously for other human coronaviruses.

96

Similarly as for other human coronaviruses, the apical-apical polarity of SARS-CoV-2

97

infection-release restricts the virus to the airway lumen16.

98

Further, we sampled the tissue at 96 h post-infection, to verify whether the subgenomic

99

mRNAs are present. The analysis was carried out with RT-PCR and the results are presented in

100

Figure 2.

Figure 2. sg mRNAs of the SARS-CoV-2 in HAE cultures. The presence of the N sg mRNAs 4 days
p.i. in the HAE cultures infected with the SARS-CoV-2 was evaluated using an RT-PCR. NC =
negative control, PC = positive control.

106

The analysis clearly showed that the sg mRNA are abundant in the infected HAE cultures.

107

As this is generally considered to be the hallmark of an active replication, we believe that it

108

provides sufficient proof that the virus is indeed actively replicating in the cultures.

109

Next, we made an effort to visualize the infection in the tissue. As at the time of the study

110

no antibody for the confocal microscopy was available, we developed an immuno-FISH assay,

111

where the viral RNA was visualized in the context of the cell using 20 sequence-specific probes

112

and signal amplification. At the same time, the β-tubulin was visualized using specific

113

antibodies to visualize the ciliated cells. Obtained results are shown in Figure 3.

Immuno-RNA FISH demonstrating localization of SARS-CoV-2 subgenomic RNA in ciliated HAE
cultures. Three-dimensionally reconstructed confocal image stacks of cells infected with SARSCoV-2 (A) and mock control cells (B). The bottom lanes of panels A and B show the xz plane in
orthogonal views. SARS-CoV-2 RNA is visualized by FISH using a set of probes against viral
nucleocapsid RNA and is shown in red. Cilia are visualized by an anti-β5 tubulin antibody and
are shown in green. Nuclei are stained with DAPI and are shown in blue. Bar = 20µM.
Summarizing, we show that the SARS-CoV-2 effectively replicates in the HAE cultures

124

and that this ex vivo model constitutes a convenient tool to study the viral infection. We also

125

show that the virus infects ciliated cells. The infection is polarized - the infection and release

126

occurs at the apical side of the epithelium. It is worth to note that in the absence of the

127

immunodetection tools the new generation of immune-FISH tools offers an interesting

128

alternative.

Materials and Methods

131

Cell culture

132

Vero E6 (Cercopithecus aethiops; kidney epithelial; ATCC: CRL-1586) cells were

133

maintained in DMEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Poland) supplemented with 3% FBS (heat-

134

inactivated fetal bovine serum; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Poland) and streptomycin

135

(100 μg/ml), penicillin (100 U/ml), and ciprofloxacin (5 μg/ml). Cells were cultured at 37°C in

136

atmosphere containing 5% CO2.

137
138

Human airway epithelium (HAE) cultures

139

Human epithelial cells were isolated from conductive airways resected from transplant

140

patients. The study was approved by the Bioethical Committee of the Medical University of

141

Silesia in Katowice, Poland (approval no: KNW/0022/KB1/17/10 dated 16.02.2010). Written

142

consent was obtained from all patients. Cells were mechanically detached from the tissue after

143

protease treatment and cultured on plastic in BEGM media. Subsequently, cells were transferred

144

onto permeable Transwell insert supports ( = 6.5 mm) and cultured in BEGM media. After the

145

cells reached full confluency, the apical medium was removed, and the basolateral medium was

146

changed to ALI. Cells were cultured for 4-6 weeks to form differentiated, pseudostratified

147

mucociliary epithelium. All experiments were performed in accordance with relevant

148

guidelines and regulations.

155

supernatant from the cultures was aliquoted and stored at −80°C. Control Vero E6 cell

156

supernatant from mock-infected cells was prepared in the same manner. Virus yield was

157

assessed by titration on fully confluent Vero E6 cells in 96-well plates, according to the method

158

of Reed and Muench. Plates were incubated at 37°C for 2 days, and the cytopathic effect (CPE)

159

was scored by observation under an inverted microscope.

Virus infection

162

Fully differentiated human airway epithelium (HAE) cultures were inoculated with the

163

SARS-CoV-2 at a TCID50 of 1000 per ml (as determined on Vero E6 cells). Following 2 h

164

incubation at 37°C, unbound virions were removed by washing with 200 μl of 1 × PBS, and

165

HAE cultures were maintained at an air-liquid interphase for the rest of the experiment. To

166

analyze virus replication kinetics, each day p.i., 100 μl of 1 × PBS was applied at the apical

167

surface of HAE and collected following the 10 min incubation at 32°C. All samples were stored

168

at −80°C and analyzed using RT-qPCR.

169
170

Additionally, 48 h post-infection, selected HAE cultures were collected, and the presence
of sg mRNA was determined as hallmarks of an active infection.

RNA Fluorescent in situ Hybridization (RNA-FISH) and Immunofluorescence

203

HAE cultures were infected with SARS-CoV-2 [TCID50=1000, as assessed for the Vero

204

E6 cells] and fixed at 5 days post-infection with 3.7% paraformaldehyde (PFA) overnight. The

205

next day, cells were subjected to RNA-FISH protocol using hybridization chain reaction (HCR)

206

technology from Molecular Instruments, Inc. Briefly, cells were permeabilized with 100%

207

methanol overnight and then subjected to grated rehydration with methanol/PBS, Tween 0.1%.

208

The set of DNA HCR v3.0 probes complementary to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid RNA was

209

incubated for 12 h at 37°C, extensively washed, and hybridized with HCR amplifiers for 12 h

210

at room temperature in the dark. Next, cells were subjected to immunostaining with antibodies

211

against mouse β5-tubulin from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (sc-134234, 1:100), rinsed three

212

times with PBS, 0.1% Tween-20 and followed by 1 h incubation with Alexa fluorophore 488

213

secondary antibodies (Invitrogen, 1:400). The cells were finally washed three times with PBS,

214

0.1% Tween-20, cell nuclei were stained with DAPI (4 =,6 =-diamidino-2-phenylindole)

215

(Thermo Fisher Scientific, D1306) and mounted on slides with Prolong diamond antifade

216

mounting medium (Invitrogen, P36970). Fluorescent images were acquired using a Zeiss LSM

217

710 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss Microscopy GmbH) with ZEN 2012 SP1 Black Edition

218

and processed in ImageJ Fiji (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA).
