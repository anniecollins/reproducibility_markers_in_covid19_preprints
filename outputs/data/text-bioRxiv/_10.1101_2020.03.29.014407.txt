Abstract
While the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is hardly hitting the world, it is of extreme importance that
significant in vitro observations guide the quick set up of clinical trials. In this study, we
evidence that the anti-SARS-CoV2 activity of a clinically achievable hydroxychloroquine
concentration is maximized only when administered before and after the infection of Vero E6
cells. This strongly suggests that only a combined prophylactic and therapeutic use of
hydroxychloroquine may be effective in limiting viral replication in patients.

Introduction
On 11th March 2020, WHO Director-General characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. As of 27th
March 2020, 549,604 total cases were confirmed, accounting for 24,863 deaths 1. To date,
the clinical management of COVID-19 subjects almost exclusively consists of supportive
therapy and, in particular, of ventilatory support for the most severe cases. Several drugs,
some already in clinical trials, are currently being used in order to limit the inflammatory
response or to hamper SARS-CoV-2 replication. Regarding the latter, no SARS-CoV-2-specific
drugs are currently available and, as a consequence, there is the need for repurposing drugs
used in other settings, such as chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) 2,3. Several
studies already demonstrated the in vitro efficacy of CQ and HCQ, evidencing the latter’s
higher activity on SARS-CoV-2 4,5. Importantly, a recent study also modeled the main
pharmacokinetic features of HCQ trying to infer its lung concentration after different dosing
regimens6.
It is therefore important to use this data in order to set up possible scenarios related to the
real clinical use of this drug. In this study, we tested HCQ against a SARS-CoV-2 Italian clinical
isolate, by using different protocols of drug administration corresponding to its possible
prophylactic, therapeutic and prophylactic/therapeutic use in patients. A single HCQ
concentration easily reachable in the lung and characterized by high anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity
was used.

Methods
Cells, virus and antivirals. Vero E6 (Vero C1008, clone E6 – CRL-1586; ATCC) cells were
cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with non-essential
amino acids (NEAA), penicillin/streptomycin (P/S), Hepes buffer and 10% (v/v) Fetal bovine
serum (FBS). A clinical isolate hCoV-19/Italy/UniSR1/2020 (GISAID accession ID:
EPI_ISL_413489) was isolated and propagated in Vero E6 cells, and viral titer was determined
by 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) and plaque assay for confirming the obtained
titer. All the infection experiments were performed in a biosafety level-3 (BLS-3) laboratory
of Microbiology and Virology at Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy. Bafilomycin
A1 (BFLA) was obtained from Merck, Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) was obtained from SigmaAldrich.
Virus isolation. An aliquot (0.8 mL) of the transport medium of the nasopharyngeal swab
(COPAN’s kit UTM® universal viral transport medium - COPAN) of a mildly symptomatic SARSCoV-2 infected patient was mixed with an equal volume of DMEM without FBS and
supplemented with double concentration of P/S and Amphotericin B. The mixture was added
to 80% confluent Vero E6 cells monolayer seeded into a 25 cm2 tissue culture flask. After 1 h
adsorption at 37°C, 3 mL of DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS and Amphotericin B were
added. Twenty-four hours post-infection (hpi) another 2 mL of DMEM supplemented with 2%
FBS and Amphotericin B were added. Live images were acquired (Olympus CKX41 inverted
phase-contrast microscopy) daily for evidence of cytopathic effects (CPE), and aliquots were
collected for viral RNA extraction and In-house one-step real-time RT-PCR assay (10.1016/
S0140-6736(20)30154-9). Five days post-infection (dpi) cells and supernatant were collected,
aliquoted and stored at -80°C (P1). For secondary (P2) virus stock, Vero E6 cells seeded into
25 cm2 tissue culture flasks were infected with 0.5 mL of P1 stored aliquot, and infected cells
and supernatant were collected 48 hpi and stored at -80°C. For tertiary (P3) virus stock, Vero
E6 cells seeded into 75 cm2 tissue culture flasks were infected with 1.5 mL of P2 stored aliquot
and prepared as above described.
Virus titration. P3 virus stocks were titrated using both Plaque Reduction Assay (PRA,
PFU/mL) and Endpoint Dilutions Assay (EDA, TCID50/mL). For PRA, confluent monolayers of
Vero E6 cells were infected with 10-fold-dilutions of virus stock. After 1 h of adsorption at
37°C, the cell-free virus was removed. Cells were then incubated for 46 h in DMEM containing
2% FBS and 0.5% agarose. Cells were fixed and stained, and viral plaques were counted. For
EDA, Vero E6 cells (4 × 105 cells/mL) were seeded into 96 wells plates and infected with base
10 dilutions of virus stock. After 1 h of adsorption at 37°C, the cell-free virus was removed,
and complete medium was added to cells. After 48 h, cells were observed to evaluate CPE.
TCID50/mL was calculated according to the Reed–Muench method.
Sequence analysis. Viral genome from supernatant infected cells was extracted using QIAamp
Viral RNA Mini Kit following manufacturers’ instructions. Reverse transcription and
subsequent amplification were performed using random hexamer primers. The amplicons
were sequenced on Illumina MiSeq NGS platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Amplicon
purification and quantification were performed by Agencourt AMPure XP (Beckman Coulter,
Villepinte, France) and Qubit dsDNA Assay Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA)

respectively. Library preparation was performed by using Nextera XT DNA Library Prep Kit
(Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). The library generated was then diluted and sequenced with
MiSeq Reagent Kit v2 (300-cycles) (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) on MiSeq platform. The
quality of raw sequences obtained from MiSeq run was first checked using FastQC (v 0.11.5)
(Babraham Bioinformatics). The reads were aligned on reference sequence (GISAID accession
ID: EPI_ISL_412973) using BWA-mem and rescued using Samtools alignment/Map (v 1.9) and
bamtoFastq. Finally, the contigs were generated using SPAdes (v 3.12.0).
Time-of-addition experiments of HCQ. Vero E6 cells (4 × 105 cells/mL) were seeded into 96
wells plates and treated with HCQ (10 μM) at different stages of virus infection. For full-time
treatment, cells were pre-treated with the drug for 1 h prior to virus infection at 37°C,
followed by virus adsorption for 1 h in the presence of the molecule. Then, cells were washed
with PBS, and further cultured at 37°C with the molecule-containing medium until the end of
the experiment. For pre-adsorption treatment, the agent was added to the cells for 1 h at
37°C before virus infection and maintained during virus adsorption. Then, the mixture was
replaced with fresh medium without molecule till the end of the experiment. For postadsorption assays, the drug-containing medium was added to cells only after virus adsorption
and maintained until the end of the experiment. Then, cells were washed with PBS, and
further cultured at 37°C with the molecule-containing medium until the end of the
experiment. BFLA (100 nM) was tested as control of inhibition of viral infectivity at a
phagolysosome level only in a pre-adsorption treatment, alone or in combination with preadsorption HCQ treatment. Uninfected cells were included in all experimental settings to
exclude possible drug-toxicity CPE. For all the experimental groups, cells were infected with
50 TCID50/mL (98 PFU/mL) SARS-CoV-2 and absorption was performed for 1h at 37°C or 4°C.
Live images were acquired (Olympus CKX41 inverted phase-contrast microscopy) and cell
supernatants were collected for real-time PCR (RT PCR) analysis at 72 hpi. All conditions were
tested in quadruplicate.
Viral RNA extraction and real-time RT-PCR. Viral RNA was purified from 140 mL of cell culture
supernatant using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN), following the manufacturer’s
instructions. Subsequently, the purified RNA was used to perform the synthesis of first-strand
cDNA, using the SuperScript™ First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Thermo Fisher
Scientific), following the manufacturer’s instruction. Real-time PCR, using SYBR® Green dyebased PCR amplification and detection method, was performed in order to detect the cDNA.
We used the SYBR™ Green PCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) the forward primer N2F:
TTA CAA ACA TTG GCC GCA AA, the reverse primer N2R: GCG CGA CAT TCC GAA GAA, and the
following PCR conditions: 95°C for 2 min, 45 cycles of 95°C for 20 sec, annealing at 55°C for
20 sec and elongation at 72°C for 30 sec, followed by a final elongation at 72°C for 10 min 7.
RT-PCR was performed using the ABI-PRISM 7900HT Fast Real-Time instruments (Applied
Biosystems) by using optical-grade 96-well plates. Samples were run in duplicate in a total
volume of 20 μL.
Statistical analysis. CPE observed for different experimental settings using HCQ and BFLA,
alone or in combination, were normalized to corresponding virus infection control. RT-PCR
results were analyzed calculating Delta (Δ) Ct as the difference between Ct values obtained

for experimental settings and infection control. Then, two-way ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple
comparisons test were performed for the evaluation of Ct differences (GraphPad Prism 8).

Results
Virus isolation and sequencing. Virus isolation was achieved after less than 72 hours. At 48
hpi the cytopathic effect (CPE) was already evident on Vero E6 cells. NGS analysis was
performed by Illumina MiSeq obtaining the whole genome sequence of the cultured isolate
hCoV-19/Italy/UniSR1/2020 (GISAID accession ID: EPI_ISL_413489).
Time-of-addition experiments of HCQ and BFLA. The two molecules were tested using
different experimental protocols, and virus adsorption was performed at both 37°C and 4°C.
CPE was assessed at 72 hpi (Fig. 1 and 2). Virus infection positive control showed marked
effects on cell morphology at 37°C as well as 4°C adsorption conditions. HCQ was effective in
full-time treatment at both adsorption temperatures, and in post-adsorption treatment only
when the virus was added to cells for 1 h at 4°C. The molecules did not show the same degree
of protection from CPE in pre-adsorption treatment at both adsorption temperatures, as well
as in post-adsorption treatment at 37°C adsorption. BFLA was tested as control of inhibition
of viral infectivity at a phagolysosome level in a pre-adsorption treatment, showing full CPE
protection at 37°C virus adsorption, while only partial protection was observed when the virus
was added to cells at 4°C (Fig. 2). No drug-related cytotoxic effect was observed on uninfected
cells, in all experimental settings (data not shown).
RT-PCR analysis. Cell supernatants of different experimental settings were collected and
analyzed by RT-PCR, and results confirmed CPE data analysis (Fig. 3). In detail, a significant
statistical difference of Delta Ct was observed with HCQ full-time treatment compared to
infection control, both at 37°C (P < 0.05) and 4°C (P < 0.0001) virus adsorption, while HCQ
post-adsorption treatment was effective (P < 0.0001) only when the virus was added to cells
at 4°C. Interestingly, BFLA addition to HCQ pre-adsorption treatment resulted in a significant
statistical difference of Delta Ct when compared to infection control at 37°C virus adsorption.

Discussion
In the lack of SARS-CoV-2-specific drugs it is extremely important to evaluate the clinical
potential of drug-repurposing in order to face the current pandemic 8. HCQ has gained the
attention of the scientific and medical community based on previous in vitro data on similar
viruses (SARS and MERS) and on preliminary reports discussing its possible clinical
effectiveness 2-4. In this atypical context, in which on-field medicine often anticipates
experimental laboratory pre-clinic, there is urgent need of prompt experiments addressing
specific clinical questions. For example, it is not clear what is the best administration regimen
to maximise possible HCQ anti-viral effectiveness in COVID-19 patients. At this regard, a
recent study evaluated the direct anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect in vitro and, importantly, modelled
its bioavailability at the lung level where it could maximally exert its antiviral activity. Based
on a dosing regimen of 400 mg given twice daily for 1 day, followed by 200 mg twice daily for
4 more days, it also suggested the more useful drug concentrations to be used in clinicallyoriented phenotypic laboratory assays5,6,9.
On that basis, we evaluated the HCQ antiviral activity when administered before (preadsorption), after (post-adsorption) or before and after (full-time) virus adsorption in order to
simulate its possible prophylactic, therapeutic and prophylactic/therapeutic clinical use.
Moreover, we focused our attention on a single concentration (10 uM) easily achieved, well
tolerated and endowed with a strong antiviral activity6. Moreover, in order to speculate on
its possible mechanism of action, we also evaluated HCQ activity performing virus adsorption
at 37 and 4°C. In fact, at 37°C the virus enters the cell in a more physiological context while,
conversely, at 4°C virus it can dock to the cell receptor, but its internalisation is much more
limited.
In the prophylactic setting (pre-adsorption), 10uM HCQ did not interfere effectively with the
viral replicative cycle neither at 37°C nor at 4°C, as evidenced in the CPE and the RT-PCR
analysis. A limited antiviral activity was also observed in the therapeutic setting (postadsorption) but, interestingly, a higher HCQ antiviral activity was observed at 4°C, suggesting
its predominant SARS-CoV-2 interference at the endosomal level 10,11. Overall, and most
importantly, these results suggest a limited activity of HCQ when administered only
prophylactically or therapeutically.
On the contrary, a significant antiviral activity was observed in the prophylactic/therapeutic
(full-time) experimental setting both at 37°C and 4°C, as evidenced both by CPE and RT-PCR
analyses. This observation allows to speculate on the need of a combined prophylactic and
therapeutic clinical use of HCQ on in order to maximise its antiviral effects. In the atypical
scenario of an ongoing pandemic, pre-clinical medical research should be focused on simple
and fast observations potentially useful for the prompt set up of clinical trials. As an example,
our observation could be easily translated in a clinical study on extremely high-risk categories,
such as health care workers, based on the prophylactic administration of HCQ followed by its
therapeutic use in case of positivity to SARS-CoV-2. The time is crucial during a pandemic and
the correct clinical repurposing of HCQ could be really invaluable.
