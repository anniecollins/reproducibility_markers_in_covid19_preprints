Abstract
The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is driving a global pandemic, but its biological mechanisms
are less well understood. SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus whose multiple genomic and subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) transcripts hijack the host cell's machinery, located across distinct
cytotopic locations. Subcellular localization of its viral RNA could play important roles in
viral replication and host antiviral immune response. Here we perform computational
modeling of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA localization across eight subcellular neighborhoods.
We compare hundreds of SARS-CoV-2 genomes to the human transcriptome and other
coronaviruses and perform systematic sub-sequence analyses to identify the responsible
signals. Using state-of-the-art machine learning models, we predict that the SARS-CoV-2
RNA genome and all sgRNAs are enriched in the host mitochondrial matrix and nucleolus.
The 5’ and 3’ viral untranslated regions possess the strongest and most distinct
localization signals. We discuss the mitochondrial localization signal in relation to the
formation of double-membrane vesicles, a critical stage in the coronavirus life cycle. Our
computational analysis serves as a hypothesis generation tool to suggest models for SARSCoV-2 biology and inform experimental efforts to combat the virus.

Introduction
COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) has become a global pandemic, fueled by the rapid spread of the
coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), a positive strand RNA virus
(Sanche et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020a). The scientific community is actively trying to understand SARSCoV-2’s biological mechanisms and effects. Here, we computationally analyze the subcellular localization
patterns of SARS-CoV-2 RNA transcripts. Our results suggest potential avenues for experimental validation
and follow-up, while providing a template for in silico analyses of viral biology.
RNA subcellular localization is critical to a myriad of cellular processes (Buxbaum et al., 2015; Chin and
Lécuyer, 2017; Ryder and Lerit, 2018). Researchers have also discovered that RNA localization plays a
significant role in RNA viruses (Chou et al., 2013), with functions ranging from regulating sites of virion
assembly (Becker and Sherer, 2017) to disrupting host mitochondrial function (Somasundaran et al.,

1994). Thus, understanding the behavior and localization of SARS-CoV-2 RNA transcripts can lead to a
better understanding of its function and pathogenicity, potentially revealing targetable mechanisms.
We perform computational modelling for SARS-CoV-2 subcellular RNA localization. In particular, we build
upon our recent work developing RNA-GPS, a state-of-the-art computational model predicting highresolution RNA localization in human cells (Wu et al., 2020b), trained on transcriptome-wide localization
patterns of human RNAs across eight subcellular landmarks (Fazal et al., 2019). RNA-GPS’s strong
performance, coupled with viruses’ dependence on hijacking existing cell machinery for reproduction,
suggests that RNA-GPS could provide insights into SARS-CoV-2’s localization behavior and can focus future
experimental efforts.
We use RNA-GPS to interrogate the localization patterns of SARS-CoV-2’s genome, which spans
approximately 30 kilobases of single-stranded positive-sense RNA (Kim et al., 2020) (Figure 1a). We predict
that SARS-CoV-2 is enriched for localization in the nucleolus and the mitochondria. Comparison of SARSCoV-2’s predicted localization against that of other human coronaviruses, including strains causing the
common cold, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and the SARS outbreak of 2003, shows that
SARS-CoV-2 exhibits a stronger mitochondrial and nuclear localization signal than a large majority of its
coronavirus relatives. We additionally find that this localization signal appears to be driven by many
redundant motifs spread across the genome, suggesting its importance. We conclude by connecting our
observations to known RNA and viral biology, proposing possible explanatory mechanisms for previously
observed phenomena. Our analysis suggests experimental validation of our predictions and serves as a
framework for applying data science for principled hypothesis generation, enabling targeted response to
this and future outbreaks.

Results
We leverage our recent work developing RNA-GPS, a computational model predicting high-resolution RNA
localization in human cells trained with HEK293T APEX-seq data (Wu et al., 2020b). Briefly, RNA-GPS
predicts localization of RNA transcripts to eight different subcellular locations: the cytosol, endoplasmic
reticulum, mitochondrial matrix, outer mitochondrial membrane, nucleus, nucleolus, nuclear lamina, and
nuclear pore (Figure 1b), and has been shown to generalize well to additional cell lines including HeLa-S3
and K562. Although RNA-GPS is trained on human, not viral, RNA transcripts, its strong test performance
combined with the fact that viruses commandeer human cellular machinery suggest that it offers a
reasonable hypothesis of viral transcript localization behavior given currently available data.
We consider average localization predictions to each compartment across all released and annotated
SARS-CoV-2 genomes available as of April 6, 2020 (n = 213) on GenBank (Coordinators, 2018). SARS-CoV2 is believed to enter the cell as a positive strand genomic RNA, subsequently forming 11 positive strand
sub-genomic RNA (sgRNA) transcripts encoding different open reading frames and sharing the same 5’
leader sequence and 3’ untranslated region (UTR) (Figure 1a). Within each viral genome, we predict the
localization of each sgRNA produced from the primary SARS-CoV-2 genome. To provide more context, we
frame these predicted localization probabilities relative to the predictions of other relevant “baseline”
transcript sequences. We consider two such baselines: the distribution of model predictions on transcripts

exhibiting significant enrichment within the human HEK293T cell line (n = 366 transcripts) (Fazal et al.,
2019), and the distribution of model predictions on transcripts derived from human coronaviruses,
excluding SARS-CoV-2 (n = 191 genomes, spanning diseases from the common cold to MERS,
Supplementary Figure 1a). The human baseline gives us an idea of how strong localization signals within
SARS-CoV-2 are, relative to naturally occurring human transcripts with well-characterized localization
behaviors. The coronavirus baseline focuses on differences in the localization behavior of SARS-CoV-2
relative to similar viral specimens – differences that may help researchers focus on the particularities of
this virus. For both baselines, we calculate the proportion of the baseline distribution that the SARS-CoV2 localization prediction exceeds, which we refer to as a rank score. For example, a localization score of
0.6 for the nucleolus relative to human transcripts suggests that the particular viral RNA is more likely to
localize to the nucleolus compared to 60% of the human RNAs that shows some localization to the
nucleolus.

SARS-CoV-2 RNA subcellular localization patterns
We find that compared to transcripts with known localizations in human cells, SARS-CoV-2 has a notable
localization signal towards the mitochondrial matrix, as well as the nucleolus (Figure 1c). We observe
consistent localization predictions of different sgRNAs encoded by the virus (shown in each row, Figure
1c). Interestingly, we do not see particularly strong transcript localization towards the ER membrane or
the cytosol, compartments canonically known to harbor viral transcripts and proteins for replication and
assembly. However, prior works have shown that some RNA viruses exhibit transcript localization to
mitochondria (Somasundaran et al., 1994), and that the nucleolus plays a prominent role in the viral life
cycle, even for viruses that primarily replicate in the cytoplasm as SARS-CoV-2 does (Salvetti and Greco,
2014).
In addition to framing our results with respect to endogenous human transcripts, we also compare
predicted localization signals of SARS-CoV-2 sgRNAs to that of other human coronaviruses (Figure 1d).
Here, we observe similar overall trends in our localization predictions. We see that the mitochondrial
matrix localization signal previously described is recapitulated here, suggesting that not only does SARSCoV-2 have a mitochondrial matrix localization signature comparable to that of human transcripts also
localizing to the mitochondrial matrix, but this signal is stronger than that of other coronaviruses.
Additionally, we see an overall pattern suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may have a greater affinity for nuclear
localizations (nuclear pore, nucleus, nucleolus, and nuclear lamina) compared to other coronaviruses.
Similar to our prior results, we also see that the ER membrane localization signals are weaker for SARSCoV-2, even compared to other human coronaviruses.
We also evaluated how the viruses comprising the coronavirus baseline themselves localize, compared to
human transcripts. We found that the most prominent localization signals for general human
coronaviruses pointed towards the nucleolus, mitochondrial matrix, and ER membrane (Supplementary
Figure 1b). Overall, our computational analysis suggests that SARS-CoV-2’s sgRNA transcript localization
towards the mitochondrial matrix and nucleolus may be amplifications of localization behaviors that were
already present in coronaviruses.

To validate the robustness of these localization trends, we also trained a different predictive algorithm (a
recurrent neural network, see Methods section for additional details) on the APEX-seq data and
performed a similar set of experiments, comparing SARS-CoV-2 localization predictions to human and
coronavirus baselines. This alternative model also predicts strong mitochondrial matrix and nucleolus
localization for SARS-CoV-2 (Supplementary Figure 2). Since this algorithm uses a very different modeling
strategy as RNA-GPS and converges to similar findings, this suggests that the mitochondrial matrix and
nucleolus signals are not artifacts of a particular model and increases our confidence in the findings.

SARS-CoV-2 negative strand RNA also localizes to mitochondria and nucleolus
During its replication life cycle, SARS-CoV-2 copies its positive strand RNA to create a negative strand RNA
that serves as the template for viral “transcription” and production of sgRNAs (Wu and Brian, 2010). We
applied RNA-GPS to the negative strand RNA and discovered that the negative strand RNA also exhibits
localization signal to the mitochondrial matrix and nucleolus, albeit weaker than the positive strand
sequence (Supplementary Figure 3). This result suggests that the sequence features driving these
localization patterns are independently present in both positive and negative strand RNAs and can
potentially drive viral double-stranded RNA accumulation at specific subcellular locales.

SARS-CoV-2 5’ and 3’ UTRs contain strong localization signals
In addition to predicting localization, our computational model can also help understand which regions of
the transcript may be more responsible for driving these observed localizations. We specifically
investigated the potential contribution of the three main regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome: the shared
5’ leader sequence, the shared 3’ UTR, and the variable “coding” sequence in the middle. We predicted
the localization for each of these regions by itself (Figure 1e). The 5’ leader sequence shows the strongest
localization signal to the mitochondrial matrix, and no signal for the nucleolus. In contrast, the 3’ UTR has
the strongest localization for the nucleolus and also has strong signal for the mitochondrial matrix. The
coding sequence (CDS) also shows specific signals for these two compartments. Because the 5’ and 3’
sequences are shared by the different SARS-CoV-2 sgRNAs, this is likely a strong factor behind the
consistent localization patterns we find across the different sgRNAs. We performed further computational
ablation studies of RNA binding protein (RBP) motifs in SARS-CoV-2 and found that the known motifs do
not appear to be the primary drivers of the mitochondrial matrix and nucleolus localization patterns.
Specifically, computational deletions of all instances of each RBP motif in SARS-CoV-2 sequence, repeated
across all enriched RBPs, did not significantly alter the RNA-GPS predictions. This result suggests that the
SARS-CoV-2 localization signal is highly redundant within the viral genome.

Discussion
In this work, we apply computational models of human RNA transcript localization to better understand
the subcellular localization of the SARS-CoV-2 genome and its constituent sgRNAs. This approach builds
upon the idea that viruses must use existing human cell machinery to reproduce, and consequently that
sequence-based localization signals are likely shared between human and coronavirus transcripts. The
strengths of this approach include (1) the potential to understand viral RNA localization without the risk
of live viral cultures; (2) the ability to examine hundreds of viral isolates and related coronaviruses and

thousands of RBP motif ablations; (3) the ability to examine viral genes, UTRs, and negative strands
individually, which may otherwise require the ability to precisely synchronize and arrest the viral life cycle.
We find that SARS-CoV-2 appears to harbor strong localization signals towards the mitochondrial matrix
and nuclear compartments, comparable to human RNA and more so than other coronaviruses. This
intriguing hypothesis suggests future experimental exploration and validation.
These results might appear surprising, as one might expect localization signals to enrich towards regions
like the endoplasmic reticulum, where viral translation, viral assembly, and disruption of normal cell
activity are commonly known to occur (Fung and Liu, 2014; Minakshi et al., 2009; Nal et al., 2005).
However, coronaviruses are known to produce complex double-membrane vesicle (DMV) structures
during viral replication, which may serve functions like concealing the virus from cellular defenses
(Hagemeijer et al., 2012; Knoops et al., 2008). While these DMVs are generally believed to be formed via
viruses manipulating the ER membrane (Blanchard and Roingeard, 2015), the mechanism for importing
and packaging proteins and RNA into these miniature organelles is not as clearly understood. One possible
mechanism for importing viral RNA involves the virus exploiting endogenous RNA localization mechanisms
that the cell already possesses for existing double-membrane organelles: namely, the mitochondria.
Indeed, introducing just 2 amino acid point mutations in the murine coronavirus can cause both a
significant drop in the number of DMV structures observed, as well as a sharp increase in viral protein
localization at the mitochondria (Clementz et al., 2008). This suggests a high degree of resemblance
between the DMV and mitochondrial localization mechanisms – leading to the hypothesis that our
mitochondrial matrix localization predictions are capturing this similarity between the DMV and
mitochondria. Furthermore, DMVs have been shown to contain double-stranded RNA (Hagemeijer et al.,
2012), and our strand-agnostic localization predictions are concordant with this evidence. Under this
model, SARS-CoV-2’s strong mitochondrial localization signal relative to other coronaviruses may even
contribute to its similarly high infectivity by increasing its efficacy in generating and importing materials
into these DMV structures.
Another possible interpretation of these localization results is that previously studied viral protein
localizations are actually driven by transcript-level localizations, a mechanism that is highly prevalent for
human proteins (Blower, 2013). Protein-protein interaction studies performed on SARS-CoV-2 have found
that its NSP5 (within ORF1a), NSP13 (within ORF1b), ORF6, and ORF10 proteins interact with host proteins
that predominantly localize to nuclear compartments (Gordon et al., 2020). The same study found viral
interactions with Tomm70, a mitochondrial import receptor that plays a critical role in modulating
interferon response – a critical anti-viral cellular defense pathway (Liu et al., 2010). In both cases, localized
transcripts could be driving protein localization, enabling more focused protein-protein interactions.
Additional protein localization patterns appear within SARS-CoV-2’s more thoroughly-studied relative, the
SARS-CoV coronavirus, responsible for the 2003 SARS outbreak (Ksiazek et al., 2003). The nucleocapsid
(N) protein has been shown to dynamically localize to the nucleolus (Cawood et al., 2007). The transcribed
protein corresponding to ORF3 of SARS-CoV localizes to both the mitochondria (Yuan et al., 2006) and the
nucleolus, causing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (Yuan et al., 2005). Some even suggest a possible
mechanism where translocation of this protein between the nucleus and mitochondria influences the
cell’s interferon response (Freundt et al., 2009). It is plausible that this protein localization behavior is

conserved across both SARS-CoV and its contemporary SARS-CoV-2, especially given their relatively high
sequence homology (Lu et al., 2020), and is likewise driven by underlying transcript localization. Indeed,
these patterns can also be found much more broadly across viral species. For coronaviruses in general, N
protein localization to the host nucleolus appears to be a fairly conserved functional attribute and may
play a role in disrupting cell division and inhibition of cytokinesis (Rawlinson and Moseley, 2015; Wurm et
al., 2001). Within the influenza A virus, nonstructural protein 1 localizes to the mitochondria (Tsai et al.,
2017). For many viruses that primarily replicate within cytoplasmic regions, multiple studies have found
viral proteins that nonetheless localize to the nucleus to aid replication and disrupt host cell functionality
(Hiscox, 2003; Weidman et al., 2003).
One limitation of our work lies within its attempt to generalize models trained on human RNA transcript
localization data, to transcripts derived from a different species. A model learned on HEK293T cells also
may not be an appropriate model for cell types that are infected by SARS-CoV-2. Although the sharing of
biological machinery between human cells and SARS-CoV-2 coupled with RNA-GPS’s strong performance
on held-out test datasets leads us to believe that this approach is promising, viral infection also
substantially remodels the cell’s internal machinery, and the expression of viral RNA binding proteins (not
accounted for in our model) can both introduce errors into our predictions. Thus, localization experiments
are necessary to validate our computational analyses. Cross-referencing our results against existing
literature is somewhat limited, as most studies have focused on the localization of viral proteins rather
than viral transcripts. Furthermore, RNA localization is undoubtedly one of many pieces of complex,
interconnected mechanisms that this coronavirus adopts, and our hypotheses presented here do not
preclude (many) additional critical biological phenomena.
In summary, we build upon recent computational models of RNA subcellular localization to study, in silico,
the localization properties of SARS-CoV-2. Our results suggest that nuclear-mitochondrial transcript
localization patterns may be an important, unique characteristic of SARS-CoV-2 that warrants additional
study. We connect these observations to known viral biology regarding DMV structures in viral replication,
as well as known protein localization patterns. In doing so, we propose potential cellular mechanisms that
underpin viral biology – mechanisms that warrant experiments validating their accuracy, and perhaps
even their potential as therapeutic targets. More broadly, we hope that our study helps define a
framework for applying machine learning models to enable focused hypothesis generation, inspiring
similar studies that leverage data science to rapidly respond to emerging epidemiological challenges.

which are shown in (c). This heatmap shows rank scores, indicating how strongly each sgRNA (rows)
localizes to each compartment (columns), compared to a typical endogenous human transcript localizing
to that compartment. Colors directly correlate with indicated rank scores. Most sgRNAs exhibit similar
localization patterns, with a general enrichment towards the mitochondrial matrix and nucleolus. We also
computed these rank scores against a baseline of other coronavirus localization signals in (d). SARS-CoV2 exhibits a stronger mitochondrial matrix localization signal than most other coronaviruses, along with
greater overall nuclear localization, particularly at the nucleolus. Interestingly, localization to the ER
membrane is not present as a particularly strong signal in either context. (e) Shows the predicted

Methods
Obtaining viral genomes
SARS-CoV-2 viral genomes were programmatically queried from the GenBank online database using the
BioPython library’s Entrez module (Cock et al., 2009). Returned results were then filtered to retain only
assemblies that included annotated, named sgRNA “genes.” In cases where the shared 5’ leader sequence
or the 3’ tail were not explicitly annotated, their regions were inferred to be the 5’ and 3’ trailing bases
outside of any coding regions, respectively. As there are many SARS-CoV-2 genome assemblies that fit
these criteria, localization predictions are averaged across all genomes.
Viral genomes constituting the coronavirus baseline follow an identical process, save for using a different
query sequence with GenBank that specifically fetches matches to the six known coronaviruses known to
infect humans (excluding SARS-CoV-2): 229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1, MERS-CoV (beta coronavirus that causes
Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS), and SARS-CoV (the beta coronavirus that causes severe
acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS) (Su et al., 2016).

Sequence featurization and modelling
RNA-GPS uses k-mer featurization with k = 3, 4, 5, applied independently to the 5’ untranslated region
(UTR), coding sequence (CDS), and 3’ UTR parts of the transcript (Wu et al., 2020b). Extending this
definition to the coronavirus sgRNA sequences, we consider the shared 5’ leader sequence the fixed 5’
UTR input to our model, shared 3’ UTR sequence the fixed 3’ UTR input to our model, and the variable
sgRNA sequence the “CDS” input. For sake of consistency with sgRNA transcript mechanisms, this “CDS”
sequence includes the current reading frame, along with any 3’ downstream bases until the shared 3’ UTR
region begins. Each sgRNA is individually assigned predicted localizations.
For the deep recurrent model, we implemented and trained a recurrent neural network that consumes
raw bases as input, maps these to a 32-dimensional embedding layer, passes these through two 64dimensional gated recurrent units (GRU), and finally a fully-connected layer with sigmoid activation
producing 8 localization predictions. This flavor of GRU network is popular in sequence modelling and uses
“gating” mechanisms to enable improved learning of longer-range sequence dependencies (Chung et al.,
2014). The model was trained using the Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2014) with a batch size of 1, and
early stopping based on validation set AUROC.
Both RNA-GPS and the GRU model are trained and tuned on the same APEX-seq data, measuring
localization within HEK293T cells (Fazal et al., 2019), using identical data splits of 80% train, 10% validation,
and 10% train. Please see our RNA-GPS manuscript for additional information regarding dataset and
modelling details (Wu et al., 2020b).

Baseline construction and rank score
Baseline distributions are constructed by running a set of baseline transcript sequences through a model
predicting transcript localization. For both models (RNA-GPS and the auxiliary GRU model), there is a per-

localization baseline derived from human APEX-seq measurements, and one derived from human
coronaviruses excluding SARS-CoV-2. For each localization compartment within the human baseline, we
consider only transcripts that exhibit significant localization to that compartment, as defined by having a
logFC > 0 and adjusted p-value ≤ 0.05 when running differential expression analysis against the remainder
of the cell. Additionally, we only use transcripts not used for model training/tuning (i.e. the test data split),
as this most closely approximates what the model would predict when presented with novel sequences.
For the coronavirus baseline, we do not have systematically measured localization data, so we do not filter
as such. However, we make slight adjustments to the process of calculating the rank score (see below).
Note that due to these differences, the values produced by these two baselines are not directly
comparable.
For these baselines, we define a rank score as the proportion of baseline values that a SARS-CoV-2 sgRNA
localization prediction exceeds. A hypothetical value of 0.5 would correspond to a median, 0.25 would
correspond to the first quartile, etc.; rank score is thus bound between 0 and 1. Note that this rank is
calculated for each individual compartment separately, as the baselines themselves are compartment
specific. For the coronavirus baseline, each SARS-CoV-2 sgRNA is also compared only to homologous
sgRNAs from other coronaviruses. For example, the spike protein’s localization prediction is only
compared against localization predictions of other coronavirus spike proteins. This limits our comparison
to the set of genes with easily traceable homology across human coronaviruses, namely ORF1ab, spike
(S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) (Woo et al., 2010). As previously discussed,
localization predictions are averaged across all valid SARS-CoV-2 genomes prior to calculating rank scores.

RNA binding protein PWM identification and ablation
We use a database of 102 RNA binding protein binding motifs (Ray et al., 2013). To identify matches, we
use the same methodology as was used in the RNA-GPS manuscript (Wu et al., 2020b). Briefly, we start
with the position weight matrix (PWM) that describes the motif, adjust its probabilities to account for the
background nucleotide composition of each sequence, define a cutoff score slightly lower than the
maximum achievable log-likelihood for that PWM, and identify any subsequences that exceed that cutoff
(see RNA-GPS manuscript for additional details).
When ablating these PWMs, we use the same methodology for identifying hits, and subsequently replace
all hits with “N” bases, re-featurizing the ablated sequence as necessary before feeding into the model,
thus generating the ablated localization predictions.

Plotting and additional metrics
All plots were generated using a combination of seaborn and matplotlib Python packages (Hunter,
2007). Statistical testing was done using functions available within the scipy Python package (Virtanen
et al., 2020), and multiple hypothesis testing correction was done using the statsmodels Python
package (Seabold and Perktold, 2010).

Supplementary Figures

Supplementary Figure 1: Summary of the human coronavirus baseline. (a) shows the different viral
strains comprising the human coronavirus baseline. (b) shows the localization patterns aggregated across
all transcripts comprising the human coronavirus baseline. We see that coronaviruses in general primarily
exhibit localization towards the nucleolus, mitochondrial matrix, and ER membrane – a pattern similar to
that seen in SARS-CoV-2 (albeit less dramatic).

Supplementary Figure 2: Heatmaps of rank scores of SARS-CoV-2 localization predictions, relative to
localized human transcripts (a) and other coronavirus genomes (b), according to a deep-learning
recurrent model (GRU). This model takes a very different computational approach to predicting
localization, and thus serves as an “orthogonal” validation of results covered in our primary figures. (a)
Recapitulates that mitochondrial matrix and nucleolus are among the two most prominent localization
signals for SARS-CoV-2. (b) Recapitulates that compared to other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 generally
exhibits a stronger nuclear localization signal.

Supplementary Figure 3: Localization of negative strand sgRNA precursors. Figure 1c shows that the
positive strand sgRNA transcripts tend to exhibit localization towards the mitochondrial matrix and
nucleolus. Here, we look at the negative-strand precursors to those sgRNAs and observe that these
transcripts share similar mitochondrial matrix and nucleolus localization patterns. This is consistent with
literature studying co-localization of coronavirus double-stranded RNA and suggests yet another layer of
conservation of this localization signal.
