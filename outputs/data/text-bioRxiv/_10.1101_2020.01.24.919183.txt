25

Emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, such as SARS, MERS, Zika and highly

26

pathogenic influenza present a major threat to public health1-3. Despite intense research

27

effort, how, when and where novel diseases appear are still the source of considerable

28

uncertainly. A severe respiratory disease was recently reported in the city of Wuhan,

29

Hubei province, China. At the time of writing, at least 62 suspected cases have been

30

reported since the first patient was hospitalized on December 12nd 2019. Epidemiological

31

investigation by the local Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggested

32

that the outbreak was associated with a sea food market in Wuhan. We studied seven

33

patients who were workers at the market, and collected bronchoalveolar lavage fluid

34

(BALF) from one patient who exhibited a severe respiratory syndrome including fever,

35

dizziness and cough, and who was admitted to Wuhan Central Hospital on December

36

26th 2019. Next generation metagenomic RNA sequencing4 identified a novel RNA virus

37

from the family Coronaviridae designed WH-Human-1 coronavirus (WHCV).

38

Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that

39

WHCV was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity similarity) to a group of

40

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus,

41

subgenus Sarbecovirus) previously sampled from bats in China and that have a history

42

of genomic recombination. This outbreak highlights the ongoing capacity of viral spill-

43

over from animals to cause severe disease in humans.

44
45

Seven patients, comprising five men and two women, were hospitalized at the Central

46

Hospital of Wuhan from December 14 through December 28, 2019. The median age of the

47

patients was 43, ranging from 31 to 70 years old. The clinical characteristics of the patients

48

are shown in Table 1. Fever and cough were the most common symptoms. All patients had

49

fever with body temperatures ranging from 37.2oC to 40oC. Patients 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7 had

50

cough, while patients 1, 2 and 7 presented with severe cough with phlegm at onset of illness.

51

Patients 4 and 5 also complained of chest tightness and dyspnea. Patients 1, 3, 4 and 6

52

experienced dizziness and patient 3 felt weakness. No neurological symptoms were observed

53

in any of the patients. Bacterial culture revealed the presence of Streptococcus bacteria in

54

throat swabs from patients 3, 4 and 7. Combination antibiotic, antiviral and glucocorticoid

55

therapy were administered. Unfortunately, patient 1 and 4 showed respiratory failure: patient

56

1 was given high flow noninvasive ventilation, while patient 4 was provided with nasal/face

57

mask ventilation (Table 1).

58

Epidemiological investigation by the Wuhan CDC revealed that all the suspected cases

59

were linked to individuals working in a local indoor seafood market. Notably, in addition to

60

fish and shell fish, a variety of live wild animals including hedgehogs, badgers, snakes, and

61

birds (turtledoves) were available for sale in the market before the outbreak began, as well as

62

animal carcasses and animal meat. No bats were available for sale. While the patients might

63

have had contact with wild animals in the market, none recalled exposure to live poultry.

64

Patient 1 was a 41-year-old man with no history of hepatitis, tuberculosis or diabetes.

65

He was admitted and hospitalized in Wuhan Central Hospital 6 days after the onset of illness.

66

The patient reported fever, chest tightness, unproductive cough, pain and weakness for one

67

week on presentation. Physical examination of cardiovascular, abdominal and neurologic

68

examination was normal. Mild lymphopenia (less than 900 cells per cubic milli-meter) was

69

observed, but white blood cell and blood platelet count was normal in a complete blood count

70

(CBC) test. Elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP, 41.4 mg/L of blood, reference range

71

0-6 mg/L) was observed and levels of aspartate aminotransferase, lactic dehydrogenase, and

72

creatine kinase were slightly elevated in blood chemistry tests. The patient had mild

73

hypoxemia with oxygen levels of 67mmHg by the Arterial Blood Gas (ABG) Test. On the

74

first day of admission (day 6 after the onset of illness), chest radiographs were abnormal with

75

air-space shadowing such a ground-glass opacities, focal consolidation and patchy

76

consolidation in both lungs (Figure 1). Chest computed tomographic (CT) scans revealed

77

bilateral focal consolidation, lobar consolidation and patchy consolidation, especially in the

78

lower lung. A chest radiograph revealed a bilateral diffuse patchy and fuzzy shadow on day 5

79

after admission (day 11 after the onset of illness). Preliminary aetiological investigation

80

excluded the presence of influenza virus, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma

81

pneumoniae by commercial pathogen antigen detection kits and confirmed by PCR. Other

82

common respiratory pathogens, including adenovirus, were also negative by qPCR (Figure

83

S1). The condition of the patient did not improve after three days of treatment with combined

84

antiviral and antibiotic therapy. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and

85

treatment with a high flow non-invasive ventilator was initiated. The patient was transferred

86

to another hospital in Wuhan for further treatment 6 days after admission.

87

To investigate the possible aetiologic agents associated this disease, we collected

88

bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from patient 1 and performed deep meta-transcriptomic

89

sequencing. All the clinical specimens were handled in a biosafety level 3 laboratory at the

90

Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center. Total RNA was extracted from 200μl BAL fluid and

91

a meta-transcriptomic library was constructed for pair-end (150 bp) sequencing using an

92

Illumina MiniSeq as previously described4-7. In total, we generated 56,565,928 sequence

93

reads that were de novo assembled and screened for potential aetiologic agents. Of the

94

384,096 contigs assembled by Megahit8, the longest (30,474 nucleotides [nt]) had high

95

abundance and was closely related to a bat SARS-like coronavirus isolate - bat-SL-CoVZC45

96

(GenBank Accession MG772933) - previously sampled in China, with a nt identity of 89.1%

97

(Table S1 and S2). The genome sequence of this novel virus, as well as its termini, were

98

determined and confirmed by RT-PCR9 and 5'/3' RACE kits (TaKaRa), respectively. This

99

new virus was designated as WH-Human 1 coronavirus (WHCV) (and has also been referred

100

to as '2019-nCoV') and its whole genome sequence (29,903 nt) has been assigned GenBank

101

accession number MN908947. Remapping the RNA-seq data against the complete genome of

102

WHCV resulted in an assembly of 123,613 reads, providing 99.99% genome coverage at a

103

mean depth of 6.04X (range: 0.01X -78.84X) (Figure S2). The viral load in the BALF sample

104

was estimated by quantitative PCR (qPCR) to be 3.95×108 copies/mL (Figure S3).

105

The viral genome organization of WHCV was characterized by sequence alignment

106

against two representative members of the genus Betacoronavirus: a human-origin

107

coronavirus (SARS-CoV Tor2, AY274119) and a bat-origin coronavirus (Bat-SL-CoVZC45,

108

MG772933) (Figure 2). The un-translational regions (UTR) and open reading frame (ORF) of

109

WHCV were mapped based on this sequence alignment and ORF prediction. The WHCV

110

viral genome was similar to these two coronaviruses (Figure 2 and Table S3), with a gene

111

order 5'-replicase ORF1ab-S-envelope(E)-membrane(M)-N-3'. WHCV has 5' and 3' terminal

112

sequences typical of the betacoronaviruses, with 265 nt at the 5' terminal and 229 nt at the 3'

113

terminal region. The predicted replicase ORF1ab gene of WHCV is 21,291 nt in length and

114

contained 16 predicted non-structural proteins (Table S4), followed by (at least) 13

115

downstream ORFs. Additionally, WHCV shares a highly conserved domain (LLRKNGNKG:

116

amino acids 122-130) with SARS-CoV in nsp1. The predicted S, ORF3a, E, M and N genes

117

of WHCV are 3,822, 828, 228, 669 and 1,260 nt in length, respectively. In addition to these

118

ORFs regions that are shared by all members of the subgenus Sarbecovirus, WHCV is similar

119

to SARS-CoV in that it carries a predicted ORF8 gene (366 nt in length) located between the

120

M and N ORF genes. The functions of WHCV ORFs were predicted based on those of known

121

coronaviruses and given in Table S5. In a manner similar to SARS CoV Tor2, a leader

122

transcription regulatory sequence (TRS) and nine putative body TRSs could be readily

123

identified upstream of the 5' end of ORF, with the putative conserved TRS core sequence

124

appeared in two forms – the ACGAAC or CUAAAC (Table S6).

125

To determine the evolutionary relationships between WHCV and previously identified

126

coronaviruses, we estimated phylogenetic trees based on the nucleotide sequences of the

127

whole genome sequence, non-structural protein genes ORF1a and 1b, and the main structural

128

proteins encoded by the S, E, M and N genes (Figures 3 and S4). In all phylogenies WHCV

129

clustered with members of the subgenus Sarbecovirus, including the SARS-CoV responsible

130

for the global SARS pandemic of 2002-20031,2, as well as a number of SARS-like

131

coronaviruses sampled from bats. However, WHCV changed topological position within the

132

subgenus Sarbecovirus depending on which gene was used, suggestive of a past history of

133

recombination in this group of viruses (Figures 3 and S4). Specifically, in the S gene tree

134

(Figure S4), WHCV was most closely related to the bat coronavirus bat-SL-CoVZC45 with

135

82.3% amino acid (aa) identity (and ~77.2% aa identity to SARS CoV; Table S3), while in the

136

ORF1b phylogeny WHCV fell in a basal position within the subgenus Sarbecovirus (Figure

137

3). This topological division was also observed in the phylogenetic trees estimated for

138

conserved domains in the replicase polyprotein pp1ab (Figure S5).

139

To better understand the potential of WHCV to infect humans, the receptor-binding

140

domain (RBD) of its spike protein was compared to those in SARS-CoVs and bat SARS-like

141

CoVs. The RBD sequences of WHCV were more closely related to those of SARS-CoVs

142

(73.8%-74.9% aa identity) and SARS-like CoVs including strains Rs4874, Rs7327 and

143

Rs4231 (75.9%-76.9% aa identity) that are able to use the human ACE2 receptor for cell entry

144

(Table S7)10. In addition, the WHCV RBD was only one amino acid longer than the SARS-

145

CoV RBD (Figure 4a). In contrast, other bat SARS-like CoVs including the Rp3 strain that

146

cannot use human ACE211, had amino acid deletions at positions 473-477 and 460-472

147

compared to the SARS-CoVs (Figure 4a). The previously determined12 crystal structure of

148

SARS-CoV RBD complexed with human ACE2 (PDB 2AJF) revealed that regions 473-477

149

and 460-472 directly interact with human ACE2 and hence may be important in determining

150

species specificity (Figure 4b). We predicted the three-dimension protein structures of WHCV,

151

Rs4874 and Rp3 RBD domains by protein homology modelling using the SWISS-MODEL

152

server and compared them to the crystal structure of SARS-CoV RBD domains (PDB 2GHV)

153

(Figure 4, c-f). In accord with the sequence alignment, the predicted protein structures of

154

WHCV and Rs4874 RBD domains were closely related to that of SARS-CoVs and different

155

from the predicted structure of the RBD domain from Rp3. In addition, the N-terminus of

156

WHCV S protein is more similar to that of SARS-CoV rather than other human coronaviruses

158

amino acid sequences and predicted protein structure between WHCV and SARS-CoV RBD

159

domains suggest that WHCV may efficiently use human ACE2 as a cellular entry receptor,

160

perhaps facilitating human-to-human transmission10, 14-15.
To further characterize putative recombination events in the evolutionary history of the

161
162

sarbecoviruses the whole genome sequence of WHCV and four representative coronaviruses -

163

Bat SARS-like CoV Rp3, CoVZC45, CoVZXC21 and SARS-CoV Tor2 - were analysed using

164

the Recombination Detection Program v4 (RDP4)16. Although the similarity plots suggested

165

possible recombination events between WHCV and SARS CoVs or SARS-like CoVs (Figure

166

S7), there was no significant evidence for recombination across the genome as a whole.

167

However, some evidence for past recombination was detected in the S gene of WHCV and

168

SARS CoV and bat SARS-like CoVs (WIV1 and RsSHC014) (p<3.147×10-3 to p<9.198×10-

171

phylogenies of the fragment nt 1 to 1029 and nt 1652 to the end of the sequence, WHCV was

172

most closely related to Bat-SL-CoVZC45 and Bat-SL-CoVZXC21, whereas in the region nt

173

1030 to 1651 (the RBD region) WHCV grouped with SARS CoV and bat SARS-like CoVs

(WIV1 and RsSHC014) that are capable of direct human transmission14,17.

179

since 2005 in China9,23-25, the exact origin of human-infected coronaviruses remains unclear.

180

Herein, we describe a novel coronavirus - WHCV - in BALF from a patient experiencing

181

severe respiratory disease in Wuhan, China. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that WHCV

182

represents a novel virus within genus Betacoronavirus (subgenus Sarbecovirus) and hence

183

that exhibits some genomic and phylogenetic similarity to SARS-CoV1, particularly in the

184

RBD. These genomic and clinical similarities to SARS, as well as its high abundance in

185

clinical samples, provides evidence for an association between WHCV and the ongoing

186

outbreak of respiratory disease in Wuhan.

187

The identification of multiple SARS-like-CoVs in bats led to the idea that these animals

188

act as the natural reservoir hosts of these viruses19,20. Although SARS-like viruses have been

189

identified widely in bats in China, viruses identical to SARS-CoV have not yet been

190

documented. Notably, WHCV is most closely related to bat coronaviruses, even exhibiting

191

100% aa similarity to Bat-SL-CoVZC45 in the nsp7 and E proteins. Hence, these data suggest

192

that bats are a possible reservoir host of WHCV. However, as a variety of animal species were

193

for sale in the market when the disease was first reported, more work is needed to determine

194

the natural reservoir and any intermediate hosts of WHCV.

Methods

321

Cases and collection of clinical data and samples

322

Patients presenting with acute onset of fever (>37.5℃), cough, and chest tightness, and who

323

were admitted to Wuhan Central Hospital in Wuhan city, China, were considered as suspected

324

cases. During admission, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected and stored at -

325

80℃ until further processing. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data were retrieved from

326

the clinical records of the confirmed patients.

327
328

RNA library construction and sequencing

329

Total RNA was extracted from the BALF sample of patient 1 using the RNeasy Plus

330

Universal Mini Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The quantity and

331

quality of the RNA solution was assessed using a Qbit machine and an Agilent 2100

332

Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) before library construction and sequencing. An RNA

333

library was then constructed using the SMARTer Stranded Total RNA-Seq Kit v2 (TaKaRa,

334

Dalian, China). Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) depletion was performed during library construction

335

following the manufacturer’s instructions. Paired-end (150 bp) sequencing of the RNA library

336

was performed on the MiniSeq platform (Illumina). Library preparation and sequencing were

337

carried out at the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.

338

Data processing and viral agent identification

339

Sequencing reads were first adaptor- and quality-trimmed using the Trimmomatic program26.

340

The remaining reads (56,565,928 reads) were assembled de novo using both the Megahit

341

(version 1.1.3)8 and Trinity program (version 2.5.1)27 with default parameter settings. Megahit

342

generated a total of 384,096 assembled contigs (size range: 200-30,474 nt), while Trinity

343

generated 1,329,960 contigs with a size range of 201 to 11,760 nt. All of these assembled

344

contigs were compared (using blastn and Diamond blastx) against the entire non-redundant

345

nucleotide (Nt) and protein (Nr) database, with e-values set to 1×10-10 and 1×10-5,

346

respectively. To identify possible aetiologic agents present in the sequence data, the

347

abundance of the assembled contigs was first evaluated as the expected counts using the

348

RSEM program28 implemented in Trinity. Non-human reads (23,712,657 reads), generated by

349

filtering host reads using the human genome (human release 32, GRCh38.p13, downloaded

350

from Gencode) by Bowtie229, were used for the RSEM abundance assessment.

351

As the longest contigs generated by Megahit (30,474 nt) and Trinity (11,760 nt) both

352

had high similarity to the bat SARS-like coronavirus isolate bat-SL-CoVZC45 and were at

353

high abundance (Table S1 and S2), the longer one (30,474 nt) that covered almost the whole

354

virus genome was used for primer design for PCR confirmation and genome termini

355

determination. Primers used in PCR, qPCR and RACE experiments are listed in Table S8. The

356

PCR assay was conducted as described previously9 and the complete genome termini was

357

determined using the Takara SMARTer RACE 5'/3' kit (TaKaRa) following the

358

manufacturer’s instructions. Subsequently, the genome coverage and sequencing depth were

359

determined by remapping all of the adaptor- and quality-trimmed reads to the whole genome

of WHCV using Bowtie229 and Samtools30.

361

The viral loads of WHCV in BALF of patient 1 were determined by quantitative real-

362

time RT-PCR with Takara One Step PrimeScript™ RT-PCR Kit (Takara RR064A) following

363

the manufacturer’s instructions. Real-time RT-PCR was performed using 2.5μl RNA with

364

8pmol of each primer and 4pmol probe under the following conditions: reverse transcription

365

at 42oC for 10 minutes, and 95oC for 1 minute, followed by 40 cycles of 95℃ for 15 seconds

366

and 60℃ for 1 minute. The reactions were performed and detected by ABI 7500 Real-Time

367

PCR Systems. PCR product covering the Taqman primers and probe region was cloned into

368

pLB vector using the Lethal Based Simple Fast Cloning Kit (TIAGEN) as standards for

369

quantitative viral load test.

370

Virus genome characterization and phylogenetic analysis

371

For the newly identified virus genome, the potential open reading frames (ORFs) were

372

predicted and annotated using the conserved signatures of the cleavage sites recognized by

373

coronavirus proteinases, and were processed in the Lasergene software package (version 7.1,

374

DNAstar). The viral genes were aligned using the L-INS-i algorithm implemented in MAFFT

375

(version 7.407)31.

376

Phylogenetic analyses were then performed using the nucleotide sequences of various

377

CoV gene data sets: (i) Whole genome, (ii) ORF1a, (iii) ORF1b, (iv) nsp5 (3CLpro), (v)

378

RdRp (nsp12), (vi) nsp13 (Hel), (vii) nsp14 (ExoN), (viii) nsp15 (NendoU), (ix) nsp16 (O-

379

MT), (x) spike (S), and the (xi) nucleocapsid (N). Phylogenetic trees were inferred using the

380

Maximum likelihood (ML) method implemented in the PhyML program (version 3.0)32, using

the Generalised Time Reversible substitution (GTR) model and Subtree Pruning and

382

Regrafting (SPR) branch-swapping. Bootstrap support values were calculated from 1,000

383

pseudo-replicate trees. The best-fit model of nucleotide substitution was determined using

384

MEGA (version 5)33. Amino acid identities among sequences were calculated using the

385

MegAlign program implemented in the Lasergene software package (version 7.1, DNAstar).

386

Genome recombination analysis

387

Potential recombination events in the history of the sarbecoviruses were assessed using both

388

the Recombination Detection Program v4 (RDP4)16 and Simplot (version 3.5.1)34. The RDP4

389

analysis was conducted based on the complete genome (nucleotide) sequence, employing the

390

RDP, GENECONV, BootScan, maximum chi square, Chimera, SISCAN, and 3SEQ methods.

391

Putative recombination events were identified with a Bonferroni corrected p-value cut-off of

392

0.01. Similarity plots were inferred using Simplot to further characterize potential

393

recombination events, including the location of breakpoints.

394

Analysis of RBD domain of WHCV spike protein

395

An amino acid sequence alignment of WHCV, SARS-CoVs, bat SARS-like CoVs RBD

396

sequences was performed using MUSCLE35. The predicted protein structures of the spike

397

protein RBD were estimated based on target-template alignment using ProMod3 on SWISS-

398

MODEL server (https://swissmodel.expasy.org/). The sequences of the spike RBD domains of

399

WHCV, Rs4874 and Rp3 were searched by BLAST against the primary amino acid sequence

400

contained in the SWISS-MODEL template library (SMTL, last update: 2020-01-09, last

401

included PDB release: 2020-01-03). Models were built based on the target-template alignment

402

using ProMod3. The global and per-residue model quality were assessed using the QMEAN

Figure 4. Analysis of receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) protein of WHCV

500

coronavirus. (a) Amino acid sequence alignment of SARS-like CoV RBD sequences. Three

501

bat SARS-like CoVs, which could efficiently utilize the human ACE2 as receptor, had an

502

RBD sequence of similar size to SARS-CoV, and WHCV contains a single Val 470 insertion.

503

The key amino acid residues involved in the interaction with human ACE2 are marked with a

504

brown box. In contrast, five bat SARS-like CoVs had amino acid deletions at two motifs

505

(amino acids 473-477 and 460-472) compared with those of SARS-CoV, and Rp3 has been

506

reported not to use ACE2.11 (b) The two motifs (aa 473-477 and aa 460-472) are shown in red

507

on the crystal structure of the SARS-CoV spike RBD complexed with receptor human ACE2

508

(PDB 2AJF). Human ACE2 is shown in blue and the SARS-CoV spike RBD is shown in

509

green. Important residues in human ACE2 that interact with SARS-CoV spike RBD are

510

marked. (c) Predicted protein structures of RBD of WHCV spike protein based on target-

511

template alignment using ProMod3 on the SWISS-MODEL server. The most reliable models

512

were selected based on GMQE and QMEAN Scores. Template: 2ghw.1.A, GMQE: 0.83;

513

QMEAN:-2.67. Motifs resembling amino acids 473-477 and 460-472 of the SARS-CoV spike

514

protein are shown in red. (d) Predicted structure of RBD of SARS-like CoV Rs4874.

515

Template: 2ghw.1.A, GMQE:0.99; QMEAN:-0.72. Motifs resembling amino acids 473-477

516

and 460-472 of the SARS-CoV spike protein are shown in red. (e) Predicted structure of the

517

RBD of SARS-like CoV Rp3. Template: 2ghw.1.A, GMQE:0.81, QMEAN:-1.50. (f) Crystal

518

structure of RBD of SARS-CoV spike protein (green) (PDB 2GHV). Motifs of amino acids

519

473-477 and 460-472 are shown in red.
