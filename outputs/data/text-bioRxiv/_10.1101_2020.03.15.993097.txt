Abstract

27

The World Health Organization has recently declared the ongoing outbreak of COVID-

28

19, which is caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, as pandemic. There is

29

currently a lack of knowledge in the antibody response elicited from SARS-CoV-2

30

infection. One major immunological question is concerning the antigenic differences

31

between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. We address this question by using plasma from

32

patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV, and plasma obtained from infected or

33

immunized mice. Our results show that while cross-reactivity in antibody binding to the

34

spike protein is common, cross-neutralization of the live viruses is rare, indicating the

35

presence of non-neutralizing antibody response to conserved epitopes in the spike.

36

Whether these non-neutralizing antibody responses will lead to antibody-dependent

37

disease enhancement needs to be addressed in the future. Overall, this study not only

38

addresses a fundamental question regarding the antigenicity differences between

39

SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, but also has important implications in vaccine

40

development.

Introduction

42

The emergence of spread of a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 causing severe

43

respiratory disease (COVID-19) has now led to a pandemic with major impact on global

44

health, economy and societal behavior (Coronaviridae Study Group of the International

45

Committee on Taxonomy of, 2020; Poon and Peiris, 2020; Zhu et al., 2020). As of 2020

46

March 15, over 150,000 confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 have been reported with close

47

to 6,000 deaths. Phylogenetic analysis has demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-

48

CoV, a coronavirus that also caused a global outbreak in 2003, are closely related

49

phylogenetically, with genomic nucleotide sequence identity of around 80% (Wu et al.,

50

2020; Zhou et al., 2020). Moreover, it has been shown that both viruses use the

51

angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the receptor for cell entry and infection

52

(Letko et al., 2020; Li et al., 2003).

53
54

The spike glycoprotein (S) on the surface of coronaviruses is essential for virus entry

55

through binding to the ACE2 receptor and viral fusion with the host cell. The S protein

56

forms a homotrimer in which each protomer is composed of two subunits, S1 and S2

57

(Figure 1A). Binding between the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the S1 subunit and

58

the ACE2 receptor triggers a conformational change in the S protein that subsequently

59

initiates membrane fusion events with the host cell. The RBD is also a primary target of

60

the antibody response in humoral immunity and is believed to be the major protective

61

antigen (Chen et al., 2005). The prefusion structure of the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 has

62

been recently determined by cryo-EM (Wrapp et al., 2020), and revealed overall

63

structural similarity to that of SARS-CoV. However, most monoclonal antibodies tested

64

to date that target the RBD of SARS-CoV have failed to bind to the RBD of SARS-CoV-2

65

(Tian et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020), suggesting that the antigenicity of these two

66

viruses to the RBD is quite distinct. So far, data have not yet been reported from

67

polyclonal human sera from patients to evaluate the antibody response elicited by

68

SARS-CoV-2 infection and to determine whether cross-reactive antibody responses

69

between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV can be generated. In this study, we examined the

70

antibody responses in 15 patients from Hong Kong who were infected by SARS-CoV-2,

71

and seven by SARS-CoV. Mice infected or immunized with SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV

72

were also used to investigate cross-reactivity of antibody responses between SARS-

73

CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.

74
75

Results

76

Patient samples show cross-reactivity in binding

77

Fifteen heparin anticoagulated plasma samples (from day 2 to 22 post-symptom onset)

78

from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients were analyzed (Table S1). Binding of plasma to the

79

S ectodomain and RBD of both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV (see Methods) was

80

measured by ELISA (Figure 1B, Figure S1). Plasma samples from healthy donors

81

collected from the Hong Kong Red Cross served as controls. As compared to the

82

plasma from healthy donors, plasma from patients from day 10 post-symptom onward

83

reacted strongly in ELISA binding assays to the S ectodomain (p-value < 2e-16, two-

84

tailed t-test) and RBD (p-value = 2e-13, two-tailed t-test) of SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly,

85

the plasma from SARS-CoV-2-infected patients could also cross-react, although less

86

strongly, with the SARS-CoV S ectodomain (p-value = 8e-06, two-tailed t-test) and the

87

SARS-CoV RBD (p-value = 0.048, two-tailed t-test) (Figure 1B). Nevertheless, only five

88

of the samples from the SARS-CoV-2-infected patients had convincing antibody binding

89

responses to the SARS-CoV RBD. The other plasma reacted more weakly or not at all

90

with the SARS-CoV RBD (Figure 1B). This result indicates that the cross-reactive

91

antibody response to the S protein after SARS-CoV-2 infection mostly targets non-RBD

92

regions. Consistent with that observation, reactivity of the plasma from SARS-CoV-24

93

infected patients could be detected with the S2 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 (p-value = 2e-4,

94

two-tailed t-test, Figure 1B).

95
96

We also analyzed seven heparin anticoagulated convalescent (3-6 months post

97

infection) plasma samples from SARS-CoV infected patients. Similar to that observed in

98

plasma samples from SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, cross-reactivity in binding could be

99

detected (Figure 1B). As compared to the plasma from healthy donors, SARS-CoV-

100

infected patients have significant cross-reactivity in binding to SARS-CoV-2 spike (p-

101

value = 0.03, two-tailed t-test), RBD (p-value = 0.03, two-tailed t-test), and S2 subunit (p-

102

value = 0.007, two-tailed t-test). These results show that cross-reactivity in binding is

103

common between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infections in both directions.

104
105

Patient samples show limited cross-neutralization

106

We next tested the neutralization activity of these plasma samples from SARS-CoV-2-

107

infected patients. Except for four plasma samples that came from patients with less than

108

12 days post-symptom onset with concomitantly low reactivity to both SARS-CoV-2 S

109

ectodomain and RBD, all other plasma samples could neutralize the SARS-CoV-2 virus

110

with titers ranging from 1:40 to 1:640 (Figure 1C, Table S1). However, only one plasma

111

sample could cross-neutralize SARS-CoV, with very low neutralization activity (1:10). In

112

fact, that cross-neutralizing plasma sample had the strongest reactivity in binding against

113

SARS-CoV S ectodomain among all 15 patient samples, although its binding activity

114

against SARS-CoV RBD is not particularly strong (Table S1).

115
116

Similarly, while five of the seven plasma samples from SARS-CoV-convalescent patients

117

could neutralize SARS-CoV with titers ranging from 1:40 to 1:320, none can cross-

118

neutralize SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 1C). These results show that although cross-reactivity in

119

binding is common between plasma from SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infected

120

patients, cross-neutralization activity is rare.

121
122

Cross-reactivity in mouse infection and vaccination

123

To further investigate the cross-reactivity of antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 and

124

SARS-CoV, we analyzed the antibody response of plasma collected from mice infected

125

or immunized with SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV (n = 5 or 6 per experimental and control

126

groups). Plasma from mice with mock immunization with a genetically more distant

127

betacoronavirus coronavirus OC43-CoV, PBS or adjuvant were used as negative

128

controls (Figure 2A-D). As compared to controls, plasma from mice immunized with

129

SARS-CoV-2 virus reacted strongly to its autologous S ectodomain (p-value < 0.002,

130

two-tailed t-test, Figure 2A) and RBD (p-value < 1e-4, two-tailed t-test, Figure 2B).

131

Similarly, plasma from mice immunized with SARS-CoV virus reacted strongly to its

132

autologous S ectodomain (p-value < 2e-7, two-tailed t-test, Figure 2C) and RBD (p-value

133

< 6e-6, two-tailed t-test, Figure 2D). In addition, plasma from mice immunized with

134

SARS-CoV S ectodomain could react to its autologous RBD (p-value < 0.02, two-tailed t-

135

test, Figure 2D). However, while plasma from mice infected with SARS-CoV virus could

136

react with its autologous S ectodomain (p-value < 8e-6, two-tailed t-test, Figure 2C) and

137

RBD (p-value < 2e-5, two-tailed t-test, Figure 2D), the reactivity of plasma from mice

138

infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus to its autologous S ectodomain and RBD could not be

139

observed in this assay (p-value > 0.28, two-tailed t-test, Figure 2A-B). Unlike SARS-CoV

140

virus, which can replicate in wild-type mice (Yang et al., 2004), it has been recently

141

shown that SARS-CoV-2 is only able to replicate in human ACE2-expression transgenic

142

mice but not wild-type mice (Bao et al., 2020), which then can explain the weak immune

143

response from SARS-CoV-2-infected wild-type mice in this study.

145

Interestingly, we observed some cross-reactivity of plasma from SARS-CoV-2-

146

immunized mice to the SARS-CoV S ectodomain (p-value < 4e-5, two-tailed t-test,

147

Figure 2C) and less so to SARS-CoV RBD (p-value < 0.006, two-tailed t-test, Figure 2D),

148

as well as plasma from SARS-CoV-infected mice to the SARS-CoV-2 S ectodomain (p-

149

value < 0.005, two-tailed t-test, Figure 2A). The conclusion that the cross-reactive

150

antibodies mostly target non-RBD regions is supported by the stronger reactivity of the

151

antibody responses from SARS-CoV-2 immunization with the SARS-CoV S ectodomain

152

than to its RBD, and that plasma from SARS-CoV-infected mice did not react at all with

153

SARS-CoV-2 RBD (p-value > 0.5, two-tailed t-test, Figure 2B). Despite the presence of

154

cross-reactivity in binding, cross-neutralization activity was not detected in any of the

155

mouse plasma samples (Figure 2E-F), corroborating with our findings from human

156

patients.

157
158

Discussion

159

The work here shows that antibody responses in the SARS-CoV-2 infected patient

160

cohort are generated to both S protein and RBD in the majority of the patients.

161

Furthermore, cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV can be detected in these plasma samples

162

as well as in mice studies. These cross-reactive antibody responses mostly target non-

163

RBD regions. Consistently, higher sequence conservation is found between the S2

164

subunits of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV (90% amino-acid sequence identity) as

165

compared to that of their RBDs (73% amino-acid sequence identity). Nonetheless, some

166

SARS-CoV-2-infected patients were able to produce cross-reactive antibody responses

167

to SARS-CoV RBD. Consistent with these findings, a human antibody CR3022 that

168

neutralizes SARS-CoV (ter Meulen et al., 2006) has recently been reported to also bind

169

to the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 (Tian et al., 2020).

171

While cross-reactive antibody binding responses to both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV S

172

proteins appears to be relatively common in this cohort, cross-neutralizing responses are

173

rare. Only one out of 15 SARS-CoV-2-infected patients was able to generate a cross-

174

neutralizing response to both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV viruses, and this cross-

175

reactive response was very weak. Therefore, it is possible that only a subset of the

176

cross-reactive binding epitopes is a bona fide neutralizing epitope. This notion is also

177

supported by our recent study, which showed that the cross-reactive antibody CR3022

178

could not neutralize SARS-CoV-2 despite its strong binding (Yuan et al., 2020). Future

179

studies need to investigate whether these non-neutralizing antibody responses can

180

confer in vivo protections despite the lack of in vitro neutralization activity, which have

181

been observed in some non-neutralizing antibodies to other viruses (Bajic et al., 2019;

182

Bangaru et al., 2019; Bootz et al., 2017; Burke et al., 2018; Dreyfus et al., 2012; Henchal

183

et al., 1988; Lee et al., 2016; Petro et al., 2015; Watanabe et al., 2019). On the contrary,

184

non-neutralizing antibody responses can also lead to antibody-dependent enhancement

185

(ADE) of infection as reported in other coronaviruses (Tseng et al., 2012; Wang et al.,

186

2014; Weiss and Scott, 1981). Whether ADE plays a role in SARS-CoV-2 infection will

187

need to be carefully examined, due to its potential adverse effect in vaccination (Tseng

188

et al., 2012).

189
190

SARS-CoV-2 is the third newly emerged coronavirus to cause outbreaks (along with

191

SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) in the past two decades. Since Coronavirus outbreak are

192

likely to continue to pose global health risks in the future (Menachery et al., 2015;

193

Menachery et al., 2016), the possibility of developing a cross-protective vaccine against

194

multiple coronaviruses has been considered. Identification of cross-protective epitopes

195

on the coronavirus S protein will be important for the development of a more universal

196

coronavirus vaccine analogous to those currently in development for influenza virus. Our

197

findings suggest that such broadly cross-protective epitopes are not common in the

198

human immune repertoire. Moving forward, monoclonal clonal antibodies discovery and

199

characterization will be crucial to the development of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in short-

200

term, as well as a cross-protective coronavirus vaccine in long-term.

Recruitment of patients and specimen collections

204

Patients with RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 disease at the Infectious Disease Centre of

205

the Princess Margaret Hospital, Hong Kong, were invited to participate in the study after

206

providing informed consent. The study was approved the institutional review board of the

207

Hong Kong West Cluster of the Hospital Authority of Hong Kong (approval number:

208

UW20-169). Specimens of heparinized blood were collected from the patients, and the

209

plasma were separated and stored at -80°C until use. The plasma was heat inactivated

210

at 56°C for 30 minutes before use. The plasma samples from patients with SARS-CoV

211

infection were obtained from the bio-repository of specimens stored from patients

224

is a novel addition to this coronavirus compared to related sequences in bats and

225

pangolins (Wong et al., 2020). The spike ectodomain constructs were fused with an N-

226

terminal gp67 signal peptide and a C-terminal BirA biotinylation site, thrombin cleavage

227

site, trimerization domain, and His6 tag. The RBD constructs were fused with an N-

228

terminal gp67 signal peptide and a C-terminal His6 tag. Recombinant bacmid DNA was

generated using the Bac-to-Bac system (Life Technologies). Baculovirus was generated

230

by transfecting purified bacmid DNA into Sf9 cells using FuGENE HD (Promega), and

231

subsequently used to infect suspension cultures of High Five cells (Life Technologies) at

232

an MOI of 5 to 10. Infected High Five cells were incubated at 28 °C with shaking at

233

110 r.p.m. for 72 h for protein expression. The supernatant was then concentrated using

234

a Centramate cassette (10 kDa MW cutoff for RBD and 30 kDa MW cutoff for spike

235

protein, Pall Corporation). Spike ectodomain and RBD proteins were purified by Ni-NTA

236

(Figure S2), followed by size exclusion chromatography, and then buffer exchanged into

ELISA binding assay

260

A 96-well enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) plate (Nunc MaxiSorp, Thermo

261

Fisher Scientific) was first coated overnight with 100 ng per well of purified recombinant

262

protein in PBS buffer. To substrate the background noise caused by the unspecific

263

binding of antibodies from the samples, serum-specific background noise (SSBN)

264

normalization approach was used (Moritz et al., 2019). In brief, an additional plate was

265

coated overnight with PBS buffer only. The plates coated with either purified

266

recombinant protein or PBS were then blocked with PBS containing 5% non-fat milk

267

powder at room temperature for 2 hours. Each mouse plasma sample was 1:10 diluted

and human sample was serially diluted from 1:100 to 1:12800 in PBS. Each sample was

269

then added into the ELISA plates that were coated with purified recombinant protein or

270

PBS buffer respectively for 2-hour incubation at 37°C. After extensive washing with PBS

271

containing 0.1% Tween 20, each well in the plate was further incubated with the HRP-

272

sheep anti-mouse or anti-human secondary antibody (1:5000, GE Healthcare) for 1 hour

273

at 37°C. The ELISA plates were then washed five times with PBS containing 0.1%

into each well. After 15 minutes incubation, the reaction was stopped by adding 50 µL of

276

2 M H2SO4 solution and analyzed on a Sunrise (Tecan) absorbance microplate reader at

277

450 nm wavelength. The normalized results were obtained by the calculating the

278

Plasma samples were diluted in serial two-fold dilutions commencing with a dilution of

283

1:10, and mixed with equal volumes of SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 at a dose of 200

284

tissue culture infective doses 50% (TCID50) determined by Vero and Vero E6 cells

285

respectively. After 1 h of incubation at 37°C, 35 µl of the virus-serum mixture was added

286

in quadruplicate to Vero or Vero E6 cell monolayers in 96-well microtiter plates. After 1 h

287

of adsorption, the virus-serum mixture was removed and replaced with 150ul of virus

288

growth medium in each well. The plates were incubated for 3 days at 37°C in 5% CO2 in

289

a humidified incubator. Cytopathic effect was observed at day 3 post-inoculation. The

290

highest plasma dilution protecting 50% of the replicate wells was denoted as the

291

neutralizing antibody titer. A virus back-titration of the input virus was included in each

292

batch of tests.
