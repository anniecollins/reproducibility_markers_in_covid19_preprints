Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic is expanding at an unprecedented rate. As a result, diagnostic services are
stretched to their limit, and there is a clear need for the provision of additional diagnostic capacity.
Academic laboratories, many of which are closed due to governmental lockdowns, may be in a
position to support local screening capacity by adapting their current laboratory practices. Here, we
describe the process of developing a SARS-Cov2 diagnostic workflow in a conventional academic
Containment Level 2 (CL2) laboratory. Our outline includes simple SARS-Cov2 deactivation upon
contact, the methods for a quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) detecting
SARS-Cov2, a description of process establishment and validation, and some considerations for
establishing a similar workflow elsewhere. This was achieved under challenging circumstances
through the collaborative efforts of scientists, clinical staff, and diagnostic staff to mitigate to the
ongoing crisis. Within 14 days, we created a validated COVID-19 diagnostics service for healthcare
workers in our local hospital. The described methods are not exhaustive, but we hope may offer
support to other academic groups aiming to set up something comparable in a short time frame.

Introduction
SARS-Cov2, the viral agent of COVID-19, is a recent introduction into the human population, and the
disease epidemic is expanding nationally (within the UK) and internationally at an unprecedented rate
[1,2]. As a result, national diagnostic services are stretched to and there is a need for alternative
laboratory facilities to provide additional diagnostic capacity. The screening of asymptomatic
individuals and healthcare workers (HCWs) will be key for controlling the epidemic and also to
ensure HCW are a) working in safe conditions with functional personal protective equipment (PPE),
b) not transmitting SARS-Cov2 to vulnerable patients on wards, and c) can return to work if they are
not actively infected [3]. However, in almost all cases, embedding a rapid testing workflow for
screening asymptomatic individuals and HCWs within the current hospital structure would add
additional pressure upon an already overstretched diagnostic service.

The UK government and other organisations have recognised the critical role of additional screening
[4]. For example, the UK has recently initiated the establishment of national testing centres for
HCWs; however, there is a need for guidance on how such systems be standardised or scaled. The
expected turnaround times from sampling collection to results being reported back to the affected
HCW is also a key issue. Whilst central screening facilities will ultimately be beneficial in curtailing
the epidemic, smaller academic and non-academic laboratories can (and should) contribute to these
efforts. Critically, local facilities (academic laboratories in proximity to or within healthcare facilities)
can frequently provide a quicker turnaround time than larger remote facilities due to simpler sampling
and shipping logistics or even overstretched, onsite diagnostic laboratories; current turnaround time is
typically >48 hours from sample being taken to provision of result. Such delays can have a negative
impact on healthcare provision, for example staffing levels may be strained due to HCWs isolating as
a result of a respiratory illnesses other than COVID-19. Therefore, there is an urgent unmet need to
establish local screening workflows for HCWs and those working in essential service industries.

One of the key limitations associated with the expansion of diagnostics to tackle the COVID-19
outbreak is the availability of protocols, or a scheme, that can be used in suitable laboratory for

detecting SARS-Cov2 in suitable clinical samples. In the given circumstances, a robust diagnostic test
for COVID-19 should be able to generate a result rapidly, but also maintain a high level of
reproducibility, specificity, and sensitivity [5]. The test also needs to be conducted on an easily
accessible clinical sample, such as a nose/mouth swab, urine, or blood. Such tests can be based upon a
direct amplification assay for a component of the viral genome, a suitable biomarker or metabolic
signature, or the measurement of an indicative acute antibody response. Given a paucity of reliable
alternatives, a PCR based approach is currently the most suitable and scalable model, whilst providing
an acceptable compromise between turnaround time and accuracy.

The key issues for rapidly establishing a new diagnostic testing platform are sampling, safety,
reagents, cleanliness, methodology, and reporting. Early indications for COVID-19 infections is that
there are relatively high titres of virus in the respiratory tract, possibly in the gastrointestinal tract, but
lower concentrations in blood [6]. Consequently, oral/nasal swabs are widely accepted as the optimal
clinical sample for HCWs and others who are likely to have a higher occupational exposure risk to the
virus through their work. These swabs need to be handled safely, so the use of a sampling method that
inactivates the virus rapidly is essential to protect the sampler and those handling the sample,
including couriers, and laboratory staff [7]. The availability and the expense of reagents required for
an effective testing programme at a specific scale (e.g. hospital, company, or local community) is
critical giving the ongoing demand for specific kits. Tests that require expensive mainstream reagents,
or those in short supply, should be avoided where possible. PCR diagnostics are prone to issues with
contamination and appropriate workflow and strict sample/reagent segregation needs to be adopted,
which may be problematic in some setting. Methodologies and equipment are variable, but every
attempt should be made to ensure the tests are performed using a standardised and validated test with
appropriate controls. Lastly, the resulting data needs to be authenticated by a qualified individual and
reported in a timely fashion through an existing and official reporting system, whilst at the same time
ensuring patient confidentiality.

Here we describe our experience in establishing a COVID-19 diagnostics laboratory in an academic
containment level 2 (BSL2) research facility (UK) in which we validated and established a real-time
PCR workflow to detect SARS-CoV2 in nasal/oral from HCWs. We developed an assay and
workflow over eight working days (set-up to validation to screening) that can produce a quantitative
diagnostic result ~4 hours after swabbing.

Methods
Swabbing
For the swabbing of known COVID-19 patients and HCWs we developed a kit that can be easily
assembled and provided in bulk. The kit contained; swabbing instructions, an individually packed
sterile swab that can be broken (VWR), a labelled sample tube, and gloves (see protocol 1).

The instructions indicate the individual to put on the gloves, remove the sterile swab from the packet
and swab the rear of the mouth, the back of throat, and then each nasal cavity (one swab, four sites).
The swab is placed into the labelled sample tube (4ml long necked externally threaded cryovials
(Nunc 379146) to avoid aerosols) and the end is submerged in 500µl transport medium/lysis buffer
(4M guanidine thiocyanate (Merck) in 25 mM Tris-HCl, 0.5% b-mercaptoethanol (Sigma), and
carrier RNA (100µl of 1µg/µl stock; Qiagen). The swab is snapped carefully to avoid disturbing the
buffer and the cap is place back onto tube containing the buffer and swab and tightened. The tube is
gently agitated to ensure even distribution of lysis buffer and labelled with an ethanol resistant pen.
The outside of the tube is sprayed with 80% ethanol, placed into a zip lock bag (Onecall) and sealed.
One glove is removed, and the zip lock bag is sprayed with 80% ethanol while being held in gloved
hand and then passed to a clean hand. The sealed bag is place in a secure biohazard labelled container
for dispatch to a certified BSL2 laboratory.

Nucleic acid extraction
The combination of 4M guanidine thiocyanate and 0.5% b-mercaptoethanol should ensure complete
lysis and deactivation of the virus but to ensure additional safety the samples are received and
unpacked in a class II microbiological safety cabinet (MSC) (see protocol 2 and buffer preparation)
[8]. Notably, whilst this process should be conducted in a sterile and clean environment with routine
cleaning sessions, given the nature of the samples this room should be isolated as “a dirty room” and
all molecular reagents should be kept elsewhere. Those working in this room should not enter the
room in which molecular reagents are kept and laboratory clothing should remain restricted to this
room.

The class II MSC should be running as ‘safe’ prior to work to ensure a stabile airflow. The cabinet
should be cleaned sequentially with bleach, 80% ethanol, and RNaseZap (Sigma). The cabinet should
be set up with the required reagents and waste vessels and sample bags placed directly inside class II
MSC and sprayed with 80% ethanol. Barcodes are scanned for tracking and arranged into batches of
≤24 for extraction, dependent on centrifuge rotor capacity. The sample tubes, still containing the
swab, should be placed into a rack, 500µl 100% ethanol (final ethanol concentration 50%) added to
the tube and these are incubated at ambient temperature for 10 minutes. Top-up lysis buffer
containing the internal extraction and amplification control (25 µl of 10-3 MS2 (~ 6 x 104 PFU/ml) per
10ml of lysis buffer in this case) is next added to each sample (400µl to make 35% final ethanol
concentration). The media is transferred into a spin column (NBS biologicals) over a 2ml RNA free
collection tube (Thermofisher). To avoid contamination only one column is open at any one time and
filter pipette tips used for each sample. The tubes should be loaded into a microcentrifuge rotor inside
the class II MSC and the aerosol-tight lid closed before returning the rotor to the microcentrifuge. The
samples are centrifuged for 30 seconds at 15,000 rpm (2 spins are required per sample to load the
entire volume of lysis buffer).

All pass-through liquid should be discarded into designated liquid collection containers (do not mix
with disinfectants containing bleach). 500µl of wash buffer 1 (1M guanidine thiocyanate in 25 mM
Tris, with 10% ethanol) is added onto the columns and centrifuged for 30 seconds at 15,000 rpm. The
pass-through liquid is discarded and 500µl of wash buffer 2 (25 mM Tris buffer with 70% ethanol) is
added and again centrifuged for 30 seconds at 15,000 rpm. Again 500µl of wash buffer 2 is added and
the tube is centrifuged for 2 minutes at 15,000 rpm, with the wash solution discarded. The silica spin
column should be transferred to a new collection tube and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 1 minute to
remove residual ethanol. The silica spin column is transferred to a new RNase free tube with the
appropriate label. 100µl of nuclease free water is added to each column and left to stand for 1 minute
before centrifugation for 1 minute at 15,000 rpm. The spin columns are discarded and 12µl of eluate
is transferred into a 96 well plate according to ‘qRT-PCR plate layout’. The remaining nucleic acid
extracts are frozen at -80oC with the location recorded on the ‘sample record’ form.

Amplification of SARS-Cov2 nucleic acid
Once the nucleic acid (viral RNA) has been extracted, it can be amplified to detect SARS-Cov2 (see
protocol 3). Notably, this work should be done in a “clean room”, and the operators should wear
laboratory clothing that is restricted to this room. Movement to other working areas where biological
or molecular contamination may be an issue should be restricted, and there should be no access to the
dirty room.

The master mix is made up of: 12.5µl 2X Luna Universal Probe One-Step reaction mix, 0.5µl of
20pmoles/µl forward primer (ATGGGTTGGGATTATCCTAAATGTGA), 0.5 of µl 20pmoles/µl
reverse primer (GCAGTTGTGGCATCTCCTGATGAG), 0.3µl of 10pmoles/µl MGB Probe 3 FAM
(ATGCTTAGAATTATGGCCTCAC), 0.5µl of 10pmoles/µl of internal control forward primer
(MS2) (supplied by Eurogentec), 0.5µl of 10pmoles/µl internal control reverse primer (MS2), 0.3µl of
10pmoles/µl internal probe (MS2 ROX), 1µl of Luna WarmStart RT Enzyme Mix (New England
Biolabs) and 3.9 µl water. Once the mastermix is prepared, it can be stored 4°C short term or -20°C

longer term. If using immediately, 20µl can be inoculated into a 96-well plate in clean Class II cabinet
and then combined with 5µl of each RNA extract to a single well, using a different pipette tip for each
well. Ideally, the master mix preparation and addition of RNA to each well should be done in
separate Class II cabinets to minimize contamination.

For a negative control an extraction control containing 5µl spiked Internal extraction and
amplification control (minimum of 2 wells) ae included. As an additional negative qRT-PCR control,
5µl nuclease-free water (minimum 2 wells) is included. As a positive qRT-PCR control 5µl of spiked
SARS-Cov2 template plasmid is included. After adding 5µl of each sample to designated well, the
plate is sealed carefully with an optically clear plastic seal using a plastic plate sealer. The plate is
centrifuged for 1 minute at 1,000 rpm at 4°C and then inserted in the qRT-PCR machine
(QuantStudio; Thermofisher scientific) and the run is parametrised. FAM and ROX are acquired;
ROX is highlighted as the internal control, the positive and negative control wells as highlighted. The
assay is run for 2 minutes at 25oC, 15 minutes at 50oC (for the reverse-transcriptase), 2 minutes at
90oC, before 45 cycles of 95oC for 3 seconds followed by 60oC for 30 seconds.

The results are determined by confirmation of the correct positive controls (amplification of the
spiked target), the extraction and amplification controls of all samples (ROX channel), no
amplification in the negative controls and all samples in the FAM channel with an appropriate (nonundulating or linear) sigmoidal curve equating with a CT value ≤36. The CT values of MS2 and MGB

Results
Establishing a workflow for SARS-Cov2 qRT-PCR
Upon the decision to rapidly establish the qRT-PCR assay we identified several challenges, these
included: a) establishment and validation of a method suitable for diagnostic reporting, b) safe
extraction of nucleic acid from a highly transmissible virus, c) accessing reagents required for
performing extractions and amplifications, d) establishing a “clean” diagnostic workflow to minimise

the risk of contamination, and e) creating a system in which HCWs could be swabbed and the data
reported confidentially within a specified timeframe.

Setting up a diagnostic qRT-PCR
In our setting, diagnosis of infections for the hospital is normally performed in the hospital diagnostic
laboratory, which is co-manned by hospital and Public Health England (PHE) staff. Upon agreement
with senior diagnostic staff we sought their approval that we could duplicate their in-house generated,
validated assay on our equipment. The diagnostic laboratory provided access to their in-house method
(designed by Martin Curran and Surendra Parmar) and provided a collection of anonymised SARSCov2 positive extractions (as determined by the same PCR method) and a cloned positive control. The
required reagents were ordered and the QuantStudio machine calibrated to run the qRT-PCR. qRTPCR was initially performed using existing positive samples and ten-fold dilutions of the cloned
target gene (a conserved region with the ORF1 polyprotein). Upon amplification, we were able to
replicate the positive signals from known positive samples (with comparable CT values of between 20
and 33) and generate a reproducible standard curve that could be used for all following amplifications
and validations (Figure 1a). Additionally, during this process we validated the amplification process
by the addition of a positive control; MS2 nucleic acid was added to all samples with the exception of
the positive SARS-Cov2 control and the negative controls (Figure 1b). Notably, these assays were run
a minimum of three occasions over differing days to assess the degree of experimental variation.
Through this procedure of testing, troubleshooting, and assay development, we were able to show
reproducible amplifications and have an assay ready for downstream validation.

Swabbing and nucleic acid extraction
It should be noted that at the time of starting the scheme that samples with the potential to harbour
SARS-Cov2 virus were classified by the UK Health and Safety Executive (HSE) as requiring a
Containment Level 3 (CL3) laboratory. This level of security was required due to the infectious nature
and potential for airborne transmission. Existing sampling procedures exploited a viral transport
media containing ingredients to preserve the virus and restrict the growth of non-viral pathogens. The

extraction of nucleic acid (or viral inactivation prior to downstream processes) in a CL3 facility was
deemed a major bottleneck that could be circumvented. Consequently, we considered it essential to
inactivate the sample safely at source so as to minimise risk.

A protocol was established that was risk assessed by the University Health and Safety Committee to
inactivate nasal/oral swabs immediately after they are taken from the individual being sampled. The
protocol is outlined in methods (protocol 2) and was established from existing methods known to
chemically inactivate viruses. We utilised existing data regarding coronavirus and other highly
infectious viral pathogens. Several methods, including heat inactivation were considered but the
selected method using guanidine thiocyanate and b-mercaptoethanol was considered to be the most
suitable for validation. Whilst existing data demonstrated that the designated approach was safe for
viral extraction it had not been tested on COVID-19 patients. A recent publication has highlighted that
traditional AVL lysis buffer, on which our home-made equivalent is based, does not lead to 100%
inactivation of live virus when mixed at a ratio of 4:1 and left with a contact time of 10 minutes.
However, our protocol relies on the use of dry swabs, therefore any dilution effect of the lysis buffer
is negated [9]. In addition, because of the locality of the testing laboratory, the minimum contact time
between the swab and the lysis buffer is typically >1hr. This was followed by the additional of ethanol
to a final concentration of 50% in a MSC.

Sample workflow
A critical step in establishing a diagnostics facility is the segregation of workspace and staff,
preventing the cross contamination of samples, equipment, and reagents. The mode of operation is not
typical for many research laboratories where communal facilities are used according to the
requirements of the specific project. The research laboratory was reorganised to create “dirty”,
“clean”, and amplification areas (Figure 2a). These were strategically located in separate rooms and a
strict regime was created where equipment, staff, PPE, and samples were restricted to these specific
rooms. All laboratory staff were trained in the new containment structure and in the assays being
performed. This component involved the transfer of materials, knowledge, and protocols between

PHE Cambridge and the research laboratory. Laboratory staff were given specific roles and were
restricted to the “clean” or “dirty” work areas for a single working day. Ultimately, we had developed
a workflow that could be tested for screening sample from COVID-19 patients (Figure 2b)

Final validation of qRT-PCR assay from known COVID-19 patients
The next stage in validating the process was to run the full extraction protocol and assays on samples
from patients that had previously tested positive for SARS-Cov2 in the assay performed by the
hospital diagnostic laboratory. Buffers and extraction kits were constructed in the “clean” rooms and
provided for patient sampling. In agreement with the hospital, for the purposes of developing a
diagnostic test, we approved that a group of 20 known COVID-19 patients and a group of 20
individuals assumed not to be infected with SARS-Cov2 would be screened. Consequently, 40 swabs
were taken according to the protocol from these individuals; these were dispatched to the laboratory
for processing and analysis. The samples were anonymised, and research workers were blinded from
knowing which samples were positive or negative. Additionally, instead of a precise 20/20 split in the
provided samples, 19 were from known SARS-cov2 patients and 21 from uninfected patients, again
this was not revealed to the staff performing the assay until after the tests results were known. Data
from this experiment are shown in Figure 3a. There was a 100% correlation between the test results
initially generated by the diagnostic laboratory and the research laboratory, with 19 generating CT
values of between X and Y, and 21 generating no detectable signal. All controls were as required. At
this point the assay was repeated several times to be further validated for reproducibility before being
offered to the hospital for the screening of HCWs.

Provision of testing for healthcare workers
Within 2 weeks of the start of the process the screening procedures were approved by the hospital and
made available for hospital staff through occupational health. A firewall was built between the
hospital and the research laboratory to protect confidential data without losing track of samples. A
system was created where samples and data could be managed within a single system through a
unique identifier number and a barcode, hence there was a logged transfer of the samples to the

research laboratory, where samples could be tested, and data reported within the research laboratory.
The hospital established a swabbing pod and offered structured screening to staff, and a depository for
samples was established at a single point within the hospital. Samples were transported securely to the
research laboratory in a risk assessed, spill proof container by selected courier, which was a member
of clinical staff involved in the project. Data from the first screening run is shown in Figure 3b and
permitted the detection of several positives. The CT values from these ranged from 18-36 and the
turnaround time was ~4 hours from sample receival to result being available for reporting. However,
given the scheduled sampling, we aimed to report the data within 24 hours.

Data were checked and validated prior to reporting by a senior member of laboratory staff. All CT
values and curves were checked, and the presence of amplification in the controls was verified. All
data were entered into the official hospital database and verified by a clinical virologist prior to
reporting back to occupational health. Residual RNA samples were suitable for downstream analysis
and we were able to contribute to ongoing COVID-19 genome sequencing projects affiliated to COGUK.

Troubleshooting
Clearly establishing an assay rapidly in difficult circumstances requires frequent validation,
reappraisal, and troubleshooting. As the project developed more levels of management, oversight, and
communication were brought in. For example, within the hospital links had to be established between
those working within the wards and occupational health as the target test population were not
reporting sick but were in fact being screened. Thus ethical, logistical, and practical barriers had to be
identified and managed.

Within the laboratory setting, potential for the contamination of materials was a key consideration that
had to be managed. For example, at one stage, background levels amplification on negative samples
was elevated above acceptable levels, which was assessed to be contamination. Based on the controls
used in a specific plate (having negative and positive extraction controls, swabs extracted using two

different kit batches, qRT-PCR negative and positive controls), we hypothesized that the
contamination was occurring in the QuantStudio equipment or sealer being used to prepare the plates.
This was potentially due to SARS-cov2 DNA that was being amplified inside the machine and
causing all samples to have CT values ~32. Consistency in CT value suggested that the issue was at
the amplification stage and not at the extraction or qRT-PCR preparation stage.

The QuantStudio comes with a Background Calibration plate as part of its calibration plates. This
plate was checked to assess whether the background profile had changed substantially. If the machine
“passed” the calibration, we assessed if the profile of the background fluorescence differed from when
it was previously calibrated. We performed a background calibration plate and then the bottom plate
of the machine was cleaned with 10% bleach, 95% ethanol, and MilliQ water. The baseplate and
optical plate were removed from the machine for deep cleaning. The baseplate was rinsed in 10%
bleach, followed by MilliQ water, 95% ethanol, then water again. Liquid was aspirated from the
wells, which were then wiped with a lens cleaner tissue. The optical plate above was wiped with
cotton swabs containing 95% ethanol in case any dust particles were occluding the surface.
A further background calibration plate was run after cleaning and several wells were found to have
high readings. To revalidate the machine, a plate of 20 mastermix plus water (negative controls) in
any “problem” wells (to rule out the possibility of well-specific amplification/contamination) and
additional wells scattered around the plate were assessed. Based on the location of the problem wells,
contamination was often more severe at the edges of the plate, so these were also checked. The rest of
the wells of the 96-well plate were filled with 10 µl of water only. The location of the “problem”
wells suggested that there might have been a failed plate seal at some point, which may have released
some DNA into the machine to amplify. This plate was found to give low background; several
positive samples and positive and negative controls were run, and the contamination issues were
found to be resolved.

Discussion
In the continuing public health crisis, we need as much capacity as possible for supporting diagnostic
services to ensure key workers and HCW are screened as frequently as possible. This places an
enormous pressure on an already saturated system. The introduction of large screening services will
play a huge role in tackling the epidemic in the UK and elsewhere but lacks some of the speed and
flexibility that small on-site diagnostic laboratories can provide. We recognised the need to repurpose
our laboratory for COVID-19 screening; this was initiated without request to provide some additional
local capacity. Many academic facilities may be in a similar position but may be unsure about how to
start proceedings and what regulations are in place. We suggest that groups establish the assay and
processes so they can be prepared as the need arises. The route we describe here is not a scalable
solution to the international lack of diagnostic testing, but a blueprint for what can be established is a
standard academic research laboratory within 14 days. At the time of writing we have a full sample
workflow from swabbing to diagnostic testing of HCWs at our healthcare facility, with the capacity of
approximately 100 tests a day with a result provided within 24 hours. This number of tests can be
expanded, but is dependent on maintaining enough extraction rooms, key staff, and of course key
reagents. We sought to develop a test that works independently of kits from major suppliers, but there
will potentially be issues with other resources as the crisis develops. The theoretical turnaround time
is 4 hours, but this is dependent on integrating with occupational health facility and the diagnostic
laboratory and ensuring there is a sustainable communication and enough staff to maintain the
process.

In setting up this process there are many challenges and pitfalls, especially given the time constraints
of providing a functional service that can be rapidly deployed, and we recognise that everything
described here is not exhaustive. Many laboratories differ in equipment, facilities, capacity, expertise
and staffing; additionally, being in close proximity to a major infectious disease centre with an
excellent diagnostic facility is a major advantage. However, the methods and stages of laboratory
repurposing described will, we hope, be of value to other academic laboratories in the UK and
internationally that are aiming to make a useful contribution. Particularly, with some simple

modifications and training we feel that this could be developed and rolled out in low and middleincome countries (LMICs), providing vital molecular capacity for this and future epidemics.

In summary, the key problems to solve are safety, reagents, cleanliness, methodology, validation, and
reporting. Here, we tackled new challenges on an almost daily basis, but deactivating the virus on
contact improved the process and ensured the swabs could be extracted safely in a CL2 laboratory.
Access to reagents is key, and we suggest that groups become less reliant on kits from major
manufacturers, unless essential. This step reduces costs and puts less pressure on existing supply
chains of key kits and equipment [10]. Cleanliness is paramount, and sample flow, room segregation,
and dedicated staff are essential. Having a reliable diagnostic facility that you can partner with will
reduce many of the initial issues. These groups, such as the PHE laboratory here, provided excellent
advice, reagents, methodology, and support for set up. Having access to good clinical facilities for
validating the assay is essential; the whole process (from swab to report) needs to be comprehensively
tested before being rolled out. Lastly, reporting needs to be conducted with the provision of
experienced staff, again a link with clinical diagnostic facility is essential.

Here we provide a brief outline of our experience in establishing a COVID-19 diagnostic laboratory
in a standard molecular bacteriology laboratory, which we hope is useful to other groups in a similar
position. It was achieved under challenging circumstances through the collaborative efforts of
scientists, clinical, and diagnostic staff with the ability to generate something constructive that we
hope will contribute to the ongoing crisis.

Risk assessment

RISK ASSESSMENT FOR USE OF PATHOGENIC ORGANISMS
In the Department of Medicine
Project Title: Processing previously inactivated COVID-19 patients’ nose and throat swabs
Investigator: Stephen Baker
Laboratory Location(s): Laboratory
Human pathogens are classified by the Advisory Committee for Dangerous Pathogens into four hazard groups
(HG 1-4). The hazard group determines the containment level (CL 1-4) that is to be applied to control the risks
to human health (certain pathogens and types of work e.g. clinical/diagnostics of tissue samples may be
derogated from the full measures described in COSHH Regulations). HG 1 agents are essentially apathogenic,
but an agent not listed in HGs 2-4 must not be assumed to be HG 1; it must be risk assessed from first
principles.
All work on human pathogens must be risk assessed. Deliberate work with HG 2 pathogens and above must be
notified to HSE on first use of the agent. In most cases work with potentially infected material can be
conducted at CL 2 and is not required to be notified.
If the pathogen is part of a project where genetically modified forms are used, the GM risk assessment will
cover all work and a separate risk assessment/HSE notification will not be required.
Note that some agents may require risk assessment/notification for the purposes of the Specified Animal
Pathogens Order regulated by DEFRA.
This RA/SOP needs to be read together with Dougan Hand book

Hazard Identification in
respect of Human Health
Outline the pathogenic
properties of the agent;
routes of transmission,
severity,
prophylaxis/treatments
available etc.
Who might be at risk?
Other lab, animal,
maintenance workers?
Wider population?

The main risk will be potential SARS-CoV-2 transmitted by aerosol to the laboratory worker.
At the moment there is not yet a treatment or prophylaxis against the virus. To remove this risk
the swabs will be directly submerged in lysis buffer (containing 4M guanidine thiocyanate,
25mM Tris pH7, 0.5% B-mercaptoethanol, and 1µl of diluted carrier RNA) at the time of
sample collection. Sample collection will be performed by trained medical staff following
normal precautions for clinical staff wearing the specified PPE as dictated by the ward.
Submersion of the swab in the lysis buffer should be sufficient for killing virus. Additionally, to
avoid handling contamination issues the tube and sample bag is to be sprayed down with 70%
EtOH in the ward. Contact time >1min is effective for killing SARS-CoV-1 (Persistence of
coronaviruses on inanimate surfaces and their inactivation with biocidal agents; Kampf et al.,
2020 Journal of Hospital Infection)
In the lab the sample will be unpacked inside a Class II MSC where EtOH will be added to final
concentration of 50% and incubated for 10 minutes at room temp. This will render the sample
safe to be used outside the cabinet.

Environmental stability.
Estimate the severity or
consequence of the harmful
effect were it to occur.

CL2 workers will follow PPE rules as described in the handbook, gown and under gloves will
be worn at all times
No virus growth or culture will be carried out at this stage and, as mentioned, all samples are
processed inside the Class II MSC.
The worker is predominantly at risk. It would not be expected that a laboratory acquired
infection would be any more severe than community acquired infection, although that risk
exists if the sample is heavily contaminated.
In the unlikely case of the worker being exposed and subsequently developing disease there is a
risk of family members being exposed as well; however, this will not be a higher risk then
community exposure.
Any personal who are immunocompromised, pregnant, or otherwise in a higher risk group, i.e.
such as pre-existing health conditions or at-risk age groups should not be processing any
samples.

Experimental Protocols
Describe the procedures to
be used and relate them to
the hazards posed by the
agent; titres, generating
aerosols, use of sharps,
infecting animals (shedding)
etc.

SOP for viral deactivation from clinical swabs prior to nucleic extraction in CL2
laboratory
Version 1.2 26th March 2020 Baker/Dougan Lab Level 5 JCBC and Goodfellow lab Level
5 Addenbrookes
Precautions
• Good clinical practice and good laboratory practice to be continued at all times
• Ensure wearing of correct PPE (according to local guidelines)
• Avoid aerosolising the media in the tube during swabbing and snapping of the swab
• Lysis buffer contains Guanidine thiocyanate and B-mercaptoethanol (in low
concentrations) so avoid leaving tube open for a prolonged period
• Ethanol is highly inflammable and should be kept away from heat sources
Taking swabs
Required:
• PPE as required according to local guidelines
• Dry sterile swab in packaging
• 4ml (high sided) cryovial containing 500µl lysis buffer (4M guanidine thiocyanate,
25mM Tris pH7, 0.5% B-mercaptoethanol, and 1µl of diluted carrier RNA)
• 70% EtOH spray for sterilising the outer tube
• Zip lock bags

1.
2.

Make sure appropriate PPE is worn prior to sampling
Label the lysis buffer tube with the information from the sampled individual with a pen
that is resistant to EtOH
3. Remove swab from packet and swab (oral or nasal) the individual using the standard
procedure for viral swabbing
4. Place the swab into the provided tube containing lysis buffer and ensure the end of the
swab is submerged
5. Snap the swab carefully to avoid disturbing the buffer
6. Place cap back onto tube containing the buffer and swab and ensure tight, shake to ensure
even distribution of lysis buffer
7. Spray the outside of the cryovial with 70% EtOH until entire tube is covered
8. Place tube into zip lock bag and seal
9. Remove one glove while holding the zip lock bag in gloved hand spray the bag with 70%
EtOH and pass to clean hand
10. Place in box for dispatch to laboratory
In the laboratory
Required:
• PPE as required according to local guidelines
• Class II MSC
• Zip lock bags containing swabs
• Microfuge
• 70% EtOH spray
• 100% ethanol
• Filter-tipped pipette tips and set of pipettes
Inside cabinet:
23. Make sure appropriate PPE is worn prior to working with the samples, lab coat and
gloves should be worn at all times.
24. Ensure class II MSC is running as ‘safe’ prior to work to ensure a stabile airflow
25. Wearing gloves and without opening the bag, check sample label and label a clean spin
column outside class II MSC
26. Open sample bag inside the class II MSC and ensure correct labelling
27. Place sample tube in a rack and add 500µl 100% EtOH (final EtOH concentration is 50%)
28. Incubate at ambient temperature for 10 minutes with gentle agitation to ensure complete
contact inside the tube
29. Spray down sample tubes and rack with 70% EtOH spray and remove from class II MSC
Outside cabinet:
30. Spin liquid through silica column in 500µl aliquots for 30 seconds at 15,000 rpm
31. Discard tube containing swab into clinical waste
32. Discard pass through liquid into suitable container. Do not mix with disinfectants
containing bleach. Dispose all liquids as chemical waste.
33. Wash using 500µl of Wash 1 for 30 seconds at 15,000 rpm and discard wash solution
34. Wash using 500µl of Wash 2 for 30 seconds at 15,000 rpm and discard wash solution
35. Wash again 500µl of Wash 2 for 2 minutes at full speed to remove all wash solution;
ensure no liquid remaining in tip of the spin column
36. Transfer to a fresh RNAse free tube
37. Elute using 50µl of nuclease free water
