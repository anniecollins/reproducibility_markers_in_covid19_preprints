ABSTRACT
The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 was identified as the causative agent of the ongoing pandemic
COVID 19. COVID-19-associated deaths are mainly attributed to severe pneumonia and respiratory
failure. Recent work demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 binds to angiotensin converting enzyme 2
(ACE2) in the lung. To better understand ACE2 abundance and expression patterns in the lung we
interrogated our in-house single-cell RNA-sequencing dataset containing 70,085 EPCAM+ lung
epithelial cells from paired normal and lung adenocarcinoma tissues. Transcriptomic analysis
revealed a diverse repertoire of airway lineages that included alveolar type I and II, bronchioalveolar,
club/secretory, quiescent and proliferating basal, ciliated and malignant cells as well as rare
populations such as ionocytes. While the fraction of lung epithelial cells expressing ACE2 was low
(1.7% overall), alveolar type II (AT2, 2.2% ACE2+) cells exhibited highest levels of ACE2 expression
among all cell subsets. Further analysis of the AT2 compartment (n = 27,235 cells) revealed a number
of genes co-expressed with ACE2 that are important for lung pathobiology including those associated
with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; HHIP), pneumonia and infection (FGG and
C4BPA) as well as malarial/bacterial (CD36) and viral (DMBT1) scavenging which, for the most part,
were increased in smoker versus light or non-smoker cells. Notably, DMBT1 was highly expressed in
AT2 cells relative to other lung epithelial subsets and its expression positively correlated with ACE2.
We describe a population of ACE2-positive AT2 cells that co-express pathogen (including viral)
receptors (e.g. DMBT1) with crucial roles in host defense thus comprising plausible phenotypic targets
for treatment of COVID-19.

INTRODUCTION
In late December 2019, an outbreak of lung pneumonia initially of unknown cause was reported in
China 1. This emerging disease, termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), was soon thereafter
attributed to infection with the novel zoonotically-transmitted coronavirus severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 2. On March 11, 2020, COVID-19 was declared a rapidly
spreading global pandemic by the world health organization. As of April 12, SARS-CoV-2 has infected
more than 1.8 million people worldwide resulting in over 110,000 deaths 3.

Upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, the clinical presentation of COVID-19 is diverse, ranging from
asymptomatic infection and mild upper respiratory illness to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress
syndrome (ARDS), respiratory failure and death 1. Recent clinical reports have suggested that old age
and comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, chronic inflammatory lung disease and cancer are
risk factors for COVID-19-associated severe pneumonia and death 1. Recent analyses reported that
COVID-19 patients who were smokers required more aggressive clinical interventions and that
smoking possibly elevates the risk of COVID-19 associated pneumonia and death 4, 5. These findings
suggest that limiting inflammatory responses by intercepting pathways involved pulmonary (and
perhaps cardiac) pathobiology may represent viable strategies to improve COVID-19 patient
outcomes.

Recent molecular studies have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 infects airway cells by binding of its
spike protein to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the same receptor used by SARS‐CoV 6, 7, 8,
9

. While SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins exhibit high degrees of homology, recent studies

have demonstrated that the novel coronavirus binds ACE2 more efficiently than the original SARSCoV virus 10, 11, 12, 13 Expression of ACE2 in the lung was suggested to implicate lung epithelial cells as
routes of entry and, thus, targets for SARS-CoV-2 infection. ACE2 is a carboxypeptidase that limits
activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), a hormonal system that plays major roles in
cardiovascular and pulmonary physiology and pathology 14. ACE2 has been shown to protect from

lung injury mediated by SARS-CoV infection which was also alleviated by targeting the RAS 15. A
large body of literature suggests that the ACE2-mediated RAS axis plays important roles in lung
function 14, susceptibility to the SARS virus 8, and inhibition of angiogenesis in lung cancer 16.
However, the role of key pathways in lung pathobiology and inflammation in the pathogenesis of
COVID-19, particularly in high risk individuals, remains unexplored.

Motivated by the current and unprecedented global health crisis, we leveraged our ongoing lung
single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) efforts to interrogate the expression of the SARS-CoV-2
receptor ACE2 in a unique cohort of 70,085 lung epithelial cells from tumor and matched uninvolved
normal lung tissues from five lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients. Among all lung epithelial
subsets, we found that ACE2 expression was higher in uninvolved AT2 cells and malignant epithelial
cells. We interrogated single-cell gene co-expression profiles and found that ACE2-epressing AT2
cells concurrently expressed other genes with important yet understudied roles in lung pathobiology
including fibrosis, modulation of chronic inflammation and innate host-defense mechanisms by
additional viral receptors and scavengers, particularly among cells from smokers. Our single-cell
analyses highlight additional possible receptors that may play a role in SARS-CoV-2 infection in the
lung epithelium and, thus, are plausible targets that can be repurposed for clinical management of
COVID-19.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Derivation of single cells from lung tissues
Two to three uninvolved normal lung tissues per patient and LUADs (n = 19 samples) were collected
from surgically resected specimens from five patients with early-stage disease (stages I-IIIA) (Table
1). All patients were evaluated at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MD
Anderson) and had provided informed consents under approved institutional review board protocols.
Fresh tissues were collected in RPMI medium supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and
maintained on ice for immediate processing. Tissues were placed in a cell culture dish containing
Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS) on ice and extra-pulmonary airways and connective tissue was
removed with scissors. Samples were transferred to a new dish on ice and minced into tiny pieces
(approximately 1mm3) followed by enzymatic digestion using a cocktail containing Collagenase A
(10103578001, Sigma Aldrich), Collagenase IV (NC9836075, Thermo Fisher Scientific), DNase I,
(11284932001, Sigma Aldrich), Dispase II (4942078001, Sigma Aldrich), Elastase 1 (NC9301601,
Thermo Fisher Scientific) and Pronase (10165921001, Sigma Aldrich). Samples were incubated in a
37 °C oven for 10 minutes with gentle rotation and then incubated for an additional 10 minutes.
Samples were then filtered through 70 μm strainers (Miltenyi biotech, 130-098-462) and washed with
ice-cold HBSS. Filtrates were then centrifuged and re-suspended in ice-cold ACK lysis buffer
(A1049201, Thermo Fisher Scientific) for red blood cell (RBC) lysis. Following RBC lysis, samples
were centrifuged and re-suspended in ice-cold FBS, filtered (using 40 μm FlowMi tip filters; H136800040, Millipore). Cells were enumerated and examined for viability by Trypan blue exclusion analysis.
Cells were immediately frozen in FBS containing 10% dimethyl sulfoxide and cryopreserved.

Sorting and enrichment of viable lung EPCAM+ epithelial singlets
At the time of processing, cryopreserved single cells from patient 1 were rapidly thawed, washed, and
stained with SYTOX Blue viability dye (S34857, Life technologies), and processed on a FACS Aria II
instrument. Cells from patients 2 through 5 were stained following washing with anti-EPCAM-PE
(347198, BD Biosciences;1:50 dilution in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, PBS, containing 2%

FBS) for 30 minutes. EPCAM-stained cells were then washed, filtered using 40 μm tip filters, stained
with SYTOX Blue and processed on a FACS Aria II instrument. Doublets and dead cells were
eliminated, and viable (SYTOX-negative) EPCAM-positive (EPCAM+, epithelial) singlets were
collected in PBS containing 2% FBS. Cells were washed again to eliminate ambient RNA, and a
sample was taken for counting by Trypan Blue exclusion (T8154, Sigma Aldrich) before loading on
10X Chromium microfluidic chips.

Preparation of single-cell 5’ gene expression libraries
Up to 10,000 cells per sample were partitioned into nanoliter-scale Gel beads-in-emulsion
(GEMs) using Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 5' Gel Bead Kit v1.1 (1000169, 10X Genomics) and
by loading onto Chromium Next GEM Chips G (1000127, 10X Genomics). GEMs were then recovered
to construct single-cell 5’ gene expression libraries using the Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 5’
Library kit (1000166, 10X Genomics) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, recovered
barcoded GEMs were broken and pooled, followed by magnetic bead clean-up (Dynabeads MyOne
Silane, 37002D, Thermo Fisher Scientific). 10X-barcoded full-length cDNA was then amplified via
PCR and analyzed using Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity DNA kit (5067-4626, Agilent). Up to 50 ng of
cDNA was carried over to construct gene expression libraries and was enzymatically fragmented and
size-selected to optimize the cDNA amplicon size prior to 5’ gene expression library construction.
Further, samples were subject to end-repair, A-tailing, adaptor ligation, and sample index PCR using
Single Index Kit T Set A (2000240, 10X Genomics) to generate Illumina-ready barcoded gene
expression libraries. Library quality and yield was measured using Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity DNA
kit (5067-4626, Agilent) and Qubit dsDNA High Sensitivity Assay Kit (Q32854, Thermo Fisher
Scientific). Indexed libraries were normalized before pooling by adjusting for the ratio of the targeted
cells per library as well as individual library concentration and pooled to a final concentration of 10 nM.
Library pools were then denatured and diluted as recommended for sequencing on the Illumina
NovaSeq 6000 platform.

scRNA-seq data analysis
Single-cell decoding was performed using available computational framework. Raw scRNA-seq data
was pre-processed, demultiplexed, aligned to human GRCh38 reference and feature-barcodes
generated using CellRanger (10X Genomics, version 3.0.2). Detailed quality control metrics were
generated and evaluated. Genes detected in < 3 cells and cells where < 200 genes had non-zero
counts were filtered out and excluded from subsequent analysis. Low quality cells where >15% of the
read counts originated from the mitochondrial genome were also discarded. In addition, cells with
>6,000 detected genes were discarded to remove likely doublet or multiplet captures. Possible batch
effects were evaluated and corrected using Harmony 17. Raw unique molecular identifier (UMI) counts
were log normalized and used for principal component analysis (PCA). We applied Seurat 18 for
clustering and UMAP 19 for dimensional reduction to perform unsupervised analysis of the highdimensional data into distinct cell clusters. EPCAM+ cells were partitioned into major airway lineage
clusters, followed by subclustering within each compartment/lineage to identify subpopulations.
Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for each cell cluster were identified using the FindAllMarkers
function in Seurat R package. The top 50 most significant DEGs were examined and an integrative
approach was used to determine cell types and states.

In addition to the bioinformatics approaches described above, all other statistical analysis was
performed using R v3.6.0. Analysis of differences in genes between groups (e.g., between ACE2postive vs. ACE2-negative; smoker vs. non/light smoker) were calculated using the FindMarkers
function in R. Pseudo-bulk gene expression values for defined cell clusters were calculated by taking
mean expression of each gene across all cells in a specific cluster. Deconvolution of AT2 cell
abundance was performed on the TCGA lung adenocarcinoma cohort by incorporating AT2 signature
genes defined by our study into MCP-counter, an R package that permits the quantification of the
absolute abundance of immune and stromal cell populations in heterogeneous tissues from
transcriptome data 20. All statistical significance testing was two-sided, and results were considered
statistically significant at p-value < 0.05. The Benjamini-Hochberg method was applied to control the

false discovery rate (FDR) in multiple comparisons (e.g. DEG analysis), and calculate adjusted pvalues (q-values).

RESULTS
Single-cell decoding of normal and malignant lung epithelial cells
We performed single-cell analysis of normal lung tissues and matched treatment-naïve early-stage
lung adenocarcinomas (LUADs) from five patients using droplet based scRNA-seq. We first
processed two normal lung tissues and a LUAD from patient 1 which resulted in 15,370 cells that
were retained for analysis. In line with studies of other organs 21, we noted that the fraction of
epithelial (EPCAM+) cells attained by unbiased analysis of lung tissues was limited (~4%, n = 624
cells) (Table 2). To better capture lung epithelial cells, including their heterogeneity, we performed
single-cell analysis of fluorescent-activated cell sorting (FACS) enriched EPCAM+ cells from three
normal lung tissues (per patient) and LUADs from four additional patients. Using this strategy, we
were able to capture on average 20-fold more lung epithelial cells (Table 2). Following quality control
and filtering, we retained 70,085 lung epithelial cells from the 19 samples (5 tumor samples, n =
13,134 cells; 14 normal lung tissues, n = 56,951 cells) (Fig. 1a). We achieved on average 146,574
reads, 9,202 unique molecular identifiers and 2,407 genes per cell (Table 2). Unsupervised clustering
analysis identified a diverse repertoire of airway lineages which were divided into 10 cell clusters with
distinct transcriptomic features (e.g., expression of lineage-specific markers) (Fig. 1a). These cell
clusters covered major lineages of lung epithelium such as alveolar type I (AT1; n = 10,775; AGER,
EMP2, CAV1), AT2 (n = 27,235; SFTPC, SFTPB, PGC), club and secretory (n = 4,625; SCGB1A1,
SCGB3A1, SCGB3A2), ciliated (n = 3,247; FOXJ1, CAPS, PIFO) and basal cells (n = 5,119; KRT17,
KRT15, TP63) including those with proliferative properties (n = 449; MKI67, TOP2A) (Fig. 1c and Fig.
S1). One cluster included bronchioalveolar cells that were enriched for markers of both AT2 and club
lineages (Fig. 1b). We also identified alveolar transitory or progenitor cells which expressed both AT2
and AT1 markers including HOPX as well as KRT7 (Fig. 1c) in line with previous reports 22, 23.
Clustering analysis also revealed a rare cell population that exclusively expressed ASCL3 and FOXI

(Fig. 1c and Fig. S1) characteristic of pulmonary ionocytes which were recently described by singlecell analysis 24, 25. Of note, most cells from the LUAD specimens clustered distinctly from cells of
uninvolved lung tissues and exhibited the highest expression of the tumor marker CEACAM5 and
mixed lineage genes (Fig. 1b-c) thus representing diverse lung malignant cells in line with recent
studies 26.

Abundance and expression patterns of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 in lung epithelium
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic caused by infection with the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2
prompted us to leverage our lung scRNA-seq dataset and interrogate expression patterns of the
SARS-Cov-2 receptor ACE2 in lung epithelial cells. We found that the fraction of ACE2-expressing
cells among all lung epithelial cells was low (n= 1,208, 1.7%) (Fig. 2a). The highest fractions of ACE2expressing cells were found in the malignant (3.5%), AT2 (2.2%) and club/secretory (2.4%) cell
clusters (Fig. 2a). Among those clusters with > 1% ACE2-positive cells, AT2 cells expressed the
highest expression of ACE2 (Fig. 2b). We then explored expression patterns of other members of the
RAS 27 (Fig. 2c). Of note, RAS genes were expressed at low levels in AT2 cells compared to other
epithelial cell subsets and AT1 cells exhibited relatively higher expression of various RAS members
such as adrenergic 2 beta receptor (ADRB2) (Fig. 2c). We then examined ACE2 expression in
subclusters of AT2 and malignant cells, the two populations with relatively highest fraction of cells
positive for the SARS-CoV-2 receptor (Fig. S2). The AT2 subcluster (AT2_c2) with relatively highest
expression of ACE2 (Fig. S2a and Fig. S2b) exhibited similar levels of RAS genes compared to other
AT2 subclusters except for elevated expression of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and the
carboxypeptidase CPM (Fig. S2c). Similarly, we did not find similar patterns of expression between
ACE2 and other members of the RAS among the malignant cell subclusters (Figs. S2c-e). Earlier
studies have shown that antihypertensive drugs such as losartan may impact expression levels of
ACE2 28, 29. We thus analyzed ACE2 expression in AT2 and lung malignant cells based on whether
patients were on antihypertensive drugs. Interestingly, while the fractions of ACE2-positive AT2 and
malignant cells were lower in losartan-treated patients, levels of ACE2 expression in those cells were

significantly higher in losartan treated patients (P < 10-16; Fig. S3). We also examined the expression
and abundance patterns of TMPRS22, a serine protease recently shown to be crucial for SARS-CoV2 spike protein priming upon host cell entry 6, as well as ADAM17, a sheddase that was shown to
cleave (shed) ACE2 30. TMPRSS2 expression level and frequency were highest in AT2 cells among
all lung subsets, whereas ADAM17 expression levels were highest in malignant cells (Fig. S4). Also,
among AT2 cells, expression levels of TMPRSS2 and ADAM17 were highest in the same AT2
subcluster as ACE2 (Figs. S2b and S4b).

We next sought to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in AT2 cells based on ACE2
expression. A cutoff of absolute gene expression fold-change >1.2 and an FDR q-value < 0.05 were
applied to select DEGs between ACE2-expressing and ACE2-absent AT2 cells. We found genes upregulated in ACE2-expressing AT2 cells that are highly pertinent to lung epithelial biology and disease
such as HHIP (lung branching and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/COPD, 31, 32), FGG (fibrosis,
pneumonia and inflammation, 33, 34) and C4BPA (complement system, pneumonia and infection, 35, 36)
(Fig. 3). In addition, we found that ACE2-expressing AT2 cells exhibited significantly higher
expression of scavengers such as CD36 37 and DMBT1, a pattern recognition receptor that plays
crucial host defense roles against bacterial and viral pathogens including influenza A and human
immune deficiency virus I (HIV-I) 38. Interestingly, DMBT1 expression was markedly and distinctly
highest in AT2 cells relative to other lung cell subsets (Fig. S5a). Also, DMBT1 expression in AT2
cells was higher compared to other coronavirus receptors such as the MERS-CoV receptor DPP4 39, 40
and BSG (also known as CD147) which was recently suggested to represent a potential alternate
route of entry for SARS-CoV-2 41 (Fig. S5a). Also, DMBT1 displayed similar patterns of expression
with ACE2 among AT2 (Fig. S5b) and lung malignant cell (Fig. S5c) subclusters.

Recently, expansion of ACE2-expressing lung epithelia in response to cigarette smoke has also been
proposed 42 and smoking was shown to activate the RAS 43. We were thus enticed to compare the
identified ACE2-co-expressed genes, along with members of the RAS, in lung epithelial cells based

on patient smoking status. We identified genes differentially expressed between AT2 cells derived
from smokers (at least 20 pack year smoking history, n = 10,901 cells) and those from non- or lightsmokers (less than five pack years, n = 16,334 cells) based on a q-value threshold of 0.05 and a foldchange cut-off of 1.5 (Fig. 4a). While ACE2 itself was not modulated by smoking status, we found that
the virus receptor and scavenger DMBT1, as well as FGG and C4BPA, were significantly increased in
smoker compared to non/light smoker AT2 cells (Fig. 4a-b). DMBT1 was not significantly differentially
modulated among malignant cells based on smoking status (Fig. 4c), though we found increased
expression of BSG and members of the RAS (mostly kallikreins) in smoker (n = 9,047) compared to
non/light smoker (n = 1,657) malignant cells (Fig. 4c-d).

Our findings on the significant associations between ACE2 and DMBT1 prompted us to probe the
correlation of both genes in the AT2 compartment. We performed pseudo-bulk analysis of the AT2
cluster (by sample) in our cohort and found that DMBT1 and ACE2 exhibited positive correlation (R =
0.3) albeit not reaching statistical significance (Fig. 5a). To validate this finding in larger cohorts, we
performed deconvolution analysis of bulk RNA-seq data of the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) LUAD
cohort to estimate the abundance of AT2 cells in normal lung tissues (n = 110). Both DMBT1 and
ACE2 expression levels significantly and positively correlated with AT2 fractions (indicated by the AT2
meta-score, P < 0.05) (Fig. 5b). Interestingly, BSG, the other recently proposed entry point for SARSCoV-2, also significantly and positively correlated with the AT2 meta-score in the normal lung tissues
(P < 0.05) (Fig. 5b). Similar results were obtained with TMPRSS2 (P < 0.05) but not ADAM17 (Fig.
S6a). Further, among TCGA normal lung tissues with high AT2 fractions (meta-score > 15.47),
DMBT1 expression significantly and positively correlated with ACE2 (R = 0.41, P < 0.05) (Fig. 5c).
We did not find significant correlation between ACE2 and TMPRSS2 nor with ADAM17 in the TCGA
lung tissues by deconvolution analysis (Fig. S6b). Our findings point to specific ACE2-expressing AT2
cells that also co-express other pathogen receptors and scavengers (e.g. DMBT1) thus possibly
representing a minute subpopulation in the lung with unique host defense properties and functions.

DISCUSSION
We interrogated our relatively large in-house single-cell RNA-sequencing dataset of 70,085 lung
epithelial cells to examine abundance and expression patterns of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2.
While ACE2 was expressed in a low fraction of lung epithelial cells (roughly 1.7%), its levels among all
lung cell subsets were highest in AT2 cells. ACE2-expressing AT2 cells co-expressed genes with
crucial roles in lung pathological conditions such as COPD, pneumonia and pathogen infection
including the viral binding scavenger DMBT1 and which overall were higher in cells derived from
smokers relative to non/light smokers. We also found that DMBT1 positively correlated with AT2 cell
fractions and with ACE2 itself within the AT2 compartment. Our findings suggest that ACE2expressing cells in the lung are relatively scarce, they exhibit unique molecular and biological features
that are pertinent to antiviral and host defense functions by the lung epithelium.

Our findings on expression of ACE2 in AT2 cells are in line with previous studies 44, 45. Hamming et al
showed abundant immunohistochemical expression of ACE2 protein in AT2 cells in the lung 45. Ace2
was shown to not only to be expressed in AT2 cells in the mouse lung but also to regulate alveolar
epithelial cell survival 46. Of note, Mossel and colleagues demonstrated that SARS-CoV, by binding to
ACE2, replicates primarily in AT2 and not AT1 cells 44. Also, AT2 cells were shown to be primarily
responsible in the lung for an innate immune response against infection with SARS-CoV 47.
Interestingly, a very recent preprint by Zhao and colleagues revealed that ACE2 expression was
concentrated in a small population (~1.4%) of AT2 cells 48. Our findings are in very close agreement
with the preprint by Zhao et al in which we find that the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 is expressed in a
minute fraction of AT2 cells (~2.2%). Here, we further interrogated a relatively larger and more diverse
repertoire of airway lineages, from both normal and lung tumor (LUAD) tissues, and found that ACE2
expression was not only highest in AT2 cells but also that malignant cells exhibited the highest ACE2positive fraction. It is worthwhile to mention that patients with cancer, including lung malignancy, may
represent a population that is extremely vulnerable to COVID-19 49. Our finding on expression of
ACE2 in lung malignant (adenocarcinoma) cells may have implications for the management of

COVID-19 in lung cancer and clinical studies are warranted to explore this conjecture. Our analysis
also revealed significantly elevated ACE2 levels, among ACE2-positive AT2 and malignant cells, in
patients who were on hypertension treatment with losartan compared to those without
antihypertensive therapy. While our finding is in line with previous reports suggesting that
antihypertensive agents may augment ACE2 expression 28, 29, 50, it needs to be interpreted with
caution. Our patient cohort is very limited in size and our study was designed with a focus on singlecell analysis of lung epithelial cells. We thus cannot construe the implications of this finding on
COVID-19 management 50, 51 and further studies are warranted to better (e.g., larger cohort) explore
the association between treatment with antihypertensive drugs and ACE2 expression in human cells.

We found that ACE2-positive compared to ACE2-negative AT2 cells exhibited increased levels of
genes with crucial roles and expression features in lung pathological diseases. The hedgehog
interacting protein HHIP was not only shown to play important roles in airway branching during lung
development 32, but also single nucleotide polymorphisms of this gene are associated with increased
risk for COPD 31, a pulmonary ailment characterized by chronic inflammation 52. FGG coding for
fibrinogen-gamma was shown to be induced by pro-inflammatory cytokines 34 and to be elevated in
lung pneumonia and infection 33. C4BPA, coding for C4BP and part of the complement system, was
found to recognize and bind pneumonia-causing streptococci in the lung epithelium 35, 36. It is
noteworthy that many patients with COVID-19 (e.g. those with severe disease) commonly display the
same pathological phenotypes, namely lung inflammation, fibrosis, and pneumonia, linked to those
ACE2-co-expressed genes. It is intriguing to suggest that perhaps this small population of ACE2expressing cells may underlie the pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome,
pneumonia and respiratory failure in COVID-19 patients. It is important to note that emerging studies
are showing that males are disproportionately affected by COVID-19, possibly due to sex-based
immunological bias or differences in smoking patterns and prevalence 53. Also, a recent preprint
suggested that smoking causes expansion of ACE2-expressing lung epithelia 42. Interestingly, several
of the ACE2-co-expressed genes we identified (FGG, DMBT1, C4BPA) were elevated in smoker AT2

cells. Of note, smoking increases lung inflammation and the risk for various lung diseases including
interstitial lung fibrosis, pneumonia and COPD 54. It is plausible that smoking may augment SARSCoV-2 entry in the lung and COVID-19 pathogenesis, a supposition that warrants future studies.

A notable finding in our study was the co-expression of pathogen including viral scavengers and
receptors such as CD36 and DMBT1 in ACE2-positive AT2 cells. We also found that among all lung
subsets, AT2 cells distinctly and markedly displayed the highest expression of DMBT1. Further,
DMBT1 correlated with AT2 fractions in independent cohorts of bulk-sequenced lung tissues and
positive correlated with ACE2 in the AT2 compartment. DMBT1, also known as gp340, was shown to
inhibit influenza A by binding to hemagglutinin (HA) on the virus 55. DMBT1 was also shown to interact
with surfactant protein D (SFTPD) in alveolar cells to agglutinate and inhibit influenza A virus 38. It has
been suggested that the antiviral drug oseltamivir cooperates with innate immune proteins such as
DMBT1 in inhibition of lung epithelial cell infection by influenza A virus 55. Interestingly soluble DMBT1
in saliva was shown to exert host defense roles (neutralization or inhibition of oral transmission)
against influenza A virus 55 as well as HIV-1 56. DMBT1 was shown to specifically inhibit HIV-1
infectivity by binding to the virus envelope protein gp120, the same protein that binds to the CD4
receptor on T cells in the host 57. Intriguingly, very much like emerging reports on ACE2 acting as an
entry route in the lung that facilitates SARS-CoV-2 infection 6, DMBT1 was shown to aid in HIV-1
transcytosis across genital tract tissue 58. Also, the study by Stoddard and colleagues demonstrated
that transport of HIV-1 can be inhibited by antibodies or peptides that block the interaction of DMBT1
with the HIV-1 envelope protein gp120 58. Given our findings on DMBT1 expression in lung AT2 cells
and its co-expression with ACE2, as well as its reported binding with multiple viruses, we suggest that
targeting DMBT1, whether by adding soluble DMBT1-derive peptides 59 or by antibody-based
neutralization, may represent a viable strategy to counteract SARS-CoV-2 infection and ameliorate
COVID-19.

In conclusion, single-cell transcriptomic analysis of our lung epithelial cell cohort demonstrated that
among all lung cell subsets AT2 cells displayed highest relative expression of the SARS-CoV-2
receptor ACE2, albeit at a low cell fraction (~2.2% of all AT2 cells). We found that the viral scavenger
DMBT1 is highly expressed in AT2 cells and correlates with ACE2 in this compartment. Our study
points to a scarce ACE2-expressing AT2 population that also expresses genes involved in
inflammatory lung pathological conditions (e.g., pneumonia) and in host defense and, thus, could be
exploited (or repurposed) as phenotypic targets for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19
disease.

smoker (n = 10,901 cells) and non/light smoker (n = 16,334 cells) patients. b) Violin plot showing
significant upregulation of FGG, C4BPA and DMBT1 in smoker AT2 cells. c) Volcano plot showing
significantly DEGs between malignant cells from smoker (n = 9,047 cells) and non/light smoker (n =
1,657) patients. d) Violin plots of select significantly up-regulated genes in smoker malignant cells. A
cutoff of absolute gene expression fold-change >1.2 and an FDR q-value < 0.05 were applied to
identify the DEGs. FDR q-values < 1× 10-300 were trimmed to 1 × 10-300 for graphical purposes.

Figure 5: Expression of the viral scavenger DMBT1 correlates with that of ACE2 in lung AT2
cells. a) Correlation between ACE2 and DMBT1 expression in pseudo-bulk data from this study. b)
Scatter plots showing correlations between estimated AT2 cell fractions and ACE2, DMBT1 and BSG
in TCGA normal lung samples. c) Significant correlation between ACE2 and DMBT1 in TCGA normal
lung samples with high AT2 cell fractions (meta-score > 15.47). Correlations were statistically
analyzed using Pearson’s correlation coefficient.
