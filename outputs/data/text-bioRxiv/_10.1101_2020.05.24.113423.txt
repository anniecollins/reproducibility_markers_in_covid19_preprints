Abstract
COVID-19, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has spread worldwide and put most of
the world under lockdown. Despite that there have been emergently approved vaccines for SARS-CoV2, COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths have remained rising. Thus, rapid diagnosis and
necessary public health measures are still key parts to contain the pandemic. In this study, the
colorimetric isothermal nucleic acid amplification tests (iNAATs) for SARS-CoV-2 detection based on
loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), cross-priming amplification (CPA), and polymerase
spiral reaction (PSR) were designed and evaluated. The three methods showed the same limit of
detection (LOD) value of 1 copy of the targeted gene per reaction. However, for the direct detection of
SARS-CoV-2 genomic-RNA, LAMP outperformed both CPA and PSR, exhibiting the LOD value of
roughly 43.14 genome copies/reaction. The results can be read with the naked eye within 45 minutes,
without cross-reactivity to closely related coronaviruses. Moreover, the direct detection of SARS-CoV-2
RNA in simulated patient specimens by iNAATs was also successful. Finally, the ready-to-use
lyophilized reagents for LAMP reactions were shown to maintain the sensitivity and LOD value of the
liquid assays. The results indicate that the colorimetric lyophilized LAMP kit developed herein is highly
suitable for detecting SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids at point-of-care.

INTRODUCTION
Coronavirus is a large family of RNA viruses, including the human coronaviruses which often cause
respiratory illnesses with mild cold symptoms [1, 2]. The two exceptions that cause severe diseases include
the fatal Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [3] and the Middle East Respiratory
Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [4]. By February 2020, the mortal pneumonia disease caused by a
novel coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2 was named COVID-19 by the World Health Organization (WHO)
[5]. In March 2020, the WHO classified the COVID-19 outbreak as "Global Pandemic" [6]. As of February
1st, 2021, COVID-19 has spread to over 220 countries and regions worldwide with more than 100 million
confirmed cases and 2.2 million casualties [7].
The genome of SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA molecule that is around 29.9 kb
in length [8, 9]. The viral genome is composed of 11 Open reading frames (ORFs), namely ORF1ab, ORF2
(Spike protein or S gene), ORF3a, ORF4 (Envelope protein or E gene), ORF5 (Membrane protein or M
gene), ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8, ORF9 (Nucleocapsid protein or N gene), and ORF10[10]. The
ORF1ab gene expresses a polyprotein comprising of 16 nonstructural proteins [10]. The sequences of four
structural proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, share
high similarity to those of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [9].
The diagnostic standard of SARS-CoV-2 involves clinical symptoms and molecular methods. For an
accurate diagnosis, the quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) for the detection of SARS-CoV-2

was soon introduced by WHO [11]. Currently, the qRT-PCR test, which is carried out using respiratory
samples (nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs), has been widely used as the gold standard method for
SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. Nevertheless, qRT-PCR requires high-cost equipment, and results are only
available within a few hours to 2 days, limiting its application at resource-limited settings.
Distinctive virological and serological assays for rapidly detecting SARS-CoV-2 at point-of-care
(POC) have been introduced. Virological diagnosis directly detects the viral nucleic acids via isothermal
nucleic acid amplification tests (iNAATs) [12-17] and CRISPR-Cas12 based method [18], while serological
tests detect the rising titers of antibody between acute and convalescent stages of infection or detect IgM in
primary infection [19-22]. However, serological diagnosis usually shows lower sensitivity especially in the
early stage of infection [23]. Meanwhile, like PCR, iNAATs that amplify the viral nucleic acids at a constant
temperature are expected to determine the presence of infectious viruses even in asymptomatic patients.
Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) was invented in 2000 and broadly utilized nowadays [2427]. LAMP was shown to be rapid, specific, and remarkably sensitive compared to conventional PCR [28,
29]. Different findings revealed that the performance of LAMP assays was in a good correlation with qRTPCR results when evaluated with clinical samples [30-33]. Standard LAMP uses only a Bst DNA polymerase
possessing strand displacement activity and no modified/labelled DNA probes are required, simplifying the
preparation procedure and significantly reducing the cost [34]. Afterward, other isothermal DNA
amplification methods developed later, which also depend on the strand displacement activity of the Bst
DNA polymerase, include cross-priming amplification (CPA) [35, 36] and polymerase spiral reaction (PSR)
[37]. While LAMP requires two to three primer pairs, PSR needs only one primer pair, and CPA uses six to
eight cross-linked primers. Various studies indicated that PSR and CPA performance regarding sensitivity
and specificity was comparable to that of LAMP [38-42]. Simple and fast detection methods for the
amplified nucleic acids, such as using SyBr Green dye or pH-sensitive indicators, have been well developed
and readily available to visualize the outcome of the three assays [43]. Also, with mutual advantages,
including easy operation, fast reaction, low-cost requirements, these methods are suitable diagnostic tools for
resource-restricted settings.
Currently, only less than 10% of COVID-19 vaccine candidates have been undergone Phase 3 clinical
trials [44]. Among them, preliminary results from three candidates developed by Pfizer, Moderna and
AstraZeneca have shown efficacies of or higher than 90% against the development of symptomatic COVID19 [45-47]. Although all vaccine candidates are considered as still in the early testing stages, many
governments have granted emergency authorization of the COVID-19 vaccines. Nevertheless, COVID-19
daily cases and deaths worldwide have kept surging even after vaccine programs have been rolled out across
many countries. Additionally, there has been a recent emergence of new COVID-19 variants that are able of
transmitting more easily. Together with a global shortage of COVID-19 vaccine supply, the outbreak could
even worsen until when effective vaccines are widely distributed. Thus, basic preventative measures
including physical distancing, wearing masks, handwashing, and rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 patients as
many as possible are still the best tools to defeat SARS-CoV-2, especially in the low- and middle-income
countries where the opportunities to access COVID-19 vaccines have still been very far away [48].
In this study, we designed and compared colorimetric LAMP, CPA, and PSR assays for SARS-CoV-2
nucleic acid detection utilizing a pH-sensitive dye for readout visualization. In particular, the options of
direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 from clinical samples and the use of ready-to-use lyophilized LAMP were
also examined and discussed.

Synthesized DNA template preparation
The synthesized DNA templates were obtained from Phu Sa Biochem, (Can Tho, Vietnam). The
sequences from 28274 to 28516 of the N gene and from 2853 to 3452 of the ORF1ab gene of SARS-CoV-2
(GenBank MN908947) were selected to serve as the positive control templates for iNAATs. The N and
ORF1ab sequences (single-strand) of MERS-CoV (GenBank JX869059.2; 28567-28751 and 3075-3303),
SARS-CoV (GenBank MK062184.1, 28278-28482 and 2954-3162), and bat SARS-like-CoV (GenBank
MN996532.1, 28205-28504 and MG772933.1, 2851-3350) were also prepared for primer specificity testing.
Primer specificity analysis
The reference genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and related species were downloaded from NCBI
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). The primer sequences were aligned to genomes of different coronaviruses to
calculate the number of mismatches using Geneious Prime 2020.0.3 (https://www.geneious.com). The
percentage of mismatch was calculated by dividing the total number of different bases between primers and
genome sequences by the total length of the primers. The software FastPCR available at
http://primerdigital.com/fastpcr.html was used for in silico PCR analysis. The software eLAMP downloaded
at https://www.nybg.org/files/scientists/dlittle/eLAMP.html was utilized for virtual LAMP analysis.

Colorimetric iNAATs
WarmStart® Colorimetric LAMP 2X Master Mix (DNA & RNA) was purchased from NEB (MA,
USA). The iNAAT reaction volume was 15 l, consisting of 1 or 5 l of template sample and 7.5 l of the
WarmStart® Colorimetric Mastermix. The LAMP reaction contains 0.8 M each inner primer (FIP and BIP),
0.1 M each outer primer (F3 and B3), 0.2 M each loop primer (FLoop and Bloop). The CPA reaction
contains 0.5 µM cross primer 1s, 0.3 µM each of primers 3a and 2a, 0.05 µM each of displacement primers
4s and 5a. The PSR reaction contains 1.6 µM each primer (PSR-F and PSR-R). The iNAAT reactions were
run in BioSan Dry block thermostat Bio TDB-100 for 30 to 45 min at 60 °C (LAMP reaction) or 63 °C (CPA
and PSR reactions). The amplification products were visualized by the color shifting from red to yellow of
the test reaction, which is based on the use of phenol red, a pH-sensitive indicator as instructed by the
manufacturer.
Evaluation of limit of detection (LOD) of colorimetric iNAATs
The copy number of the synthetic DNA template was calculated using the Endmemo program
(http://endmemo.com/bio/dnacopynum.php). The synthesized DNA template was serially diluted to various
concentrations and 1 µl of the diluted DNA sample was added to the iNAAT reactions. The reactions were
then incubated for 30 min at different temperatures according to each method.
SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from the clinical positive COVID-19 samples and cultured at Pasteur
Institute (Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam). Extracted genomic-RNA of SARS-CoV-2 was quantified via a
standard curve based on qRT-PCR Ct-value [49] and then serially diluted. Five µl of the diluted RNA
samples were added to the iNAAT reactions. The reactions were then incubated for 45 min at the proper
temperature.
Collection and preparation of clinical specimens
Four nasopharyngeal and 6 oropharyngeal swab specimens from volunteer nurses and doctors were
collected at a local hospital (Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam). All participants were confirmed negative with
SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR provided their informed consent to participate in the trial. The oropharyngeal or
nasopharyngeal specimen was collected using a sterile flocked plastic swab which was then soaked into 400
µl of nuclease-free water. Fresh samples were kept on ice until analysis or frozen for subsequent assays.
To prepare the simulated clinical specimens, various concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 synthesized
DNA or extracted viral genomic-RNA were spiked into the collected nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal
swab samples. The simulated swab specimens containing the synthetic-DNA were 10-fold diluted in the
nuclease-free water and 1 µl of the diluted sample was added to the iNAAT reactions. The samples
containing the viral RNA were 50-fold diluted in the nuclease-free water and 5 µl of the diluted sample were
added to the iNAAT reactions. Non-spiked specimens were used as negative samples.
Preparation of lyophilized reagents for LAMP assay
A 0.2 ml reaction tube containing 7.5 µl of WarmStart Colorimetric LAMP 2X Master Mix and
primers (0.1 M each F3 and B3, 0.8 M each FIP and BIP, and 0.2 M each FLoop and Bloop) was mixed
well and subjected to lyophilization in a freeze-dryer (Operon, South Korea) using a protocol based on the
method described by Saleki-Gerhardt and Zografi [50].
RESULTS
Colorimetric iNAATs for SARS-CoV-2 detection
The extracted genomic RNA of SARS-CoV-2 was utilized as the template to perform the LAMP,
CPA, and PSR reactions in the presence of the pH-sensitive indicator. The results indicated that the color
change from red to yellow of the iNAAT reactions corresponding to the amplified products generated only
when the template was present (Fig. S1, SI1 file). Next, the optimal temperature and required time of iNAAT
for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 were defined. For LAMP, 30 min was the minimum time required for the
readout of positive amplification judged by the naked eye (Fig. 1A, left panel) and the amplicons were
produced from 60 to 70 °C (Fig. 1A, right panel). Regarding CPA and PSR, amplified products could be well
visualized after 40 min (Fig. 1B and C, left panels). Meanwhile, 61 and 63 °C were the minimal temperatures
for observing CPA and PSR amplified products (Fig. 1B and C, right panels). Therefore, the incubation
temperatures of the iNAAT reaction were set at 60 °C for LAMP and 63 °C for CPA and PSR. The

incubation time was selected as 45 min for the most significant color shift. Noted that, the color of negative
control occasionally started to change to yellow only after 60 min of incubation due to the spurious
amplification. This is much longer than 30 min as reported in the other study [17]. We reason that the
difference resulted from the differences in the sequences and amounts of primers used. Given that the
majority of false-positive results of LAMP arises from the formation of primer-dimers [17], this result
indicates that the primer conditions we developed can reduce the false-positive rate of the reaction in
practical usage.

Figure 1. Optimization of the incubation time and temperature for iNAATs. The LAMP (in A), CPA (in
B) and PSR (in C) reactions were incubated from 20 to 60 min at 60 °C (LAMP) and 63 °C (CPA and PSR)
(left panels) and at different temperatures from 50 to 70 °C for 30 min (right panels).
Specificity of SARS-CoV-2 colorimetric iNAATs
The sequences of iNAATs primers used were aligned to genome sequences of different strains of
coronaviruses including 13 SARS-CoV-2 strains, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, human coronaviruses related to
the common cold (HKU1, OC43, NL63, and 229E), bat SARS-like-CoV, Murine hepatitis virus (Murine
coronavirus), and Betacoronavirus England 1. The results showed that 0% mismatch with all tested SARSCoV-2 variants (MN938384, MN975262, MN985325, MN988668, MN988669, MN988713, MN994467,
MN994468, MN997409, MT007544, MT121215, MT123292 and NC045512) was observed, suggesting that
the developed iNAATs could detect different variants of SARS-CoV-2 (Table 2). In contrast, except for bat
SARS-like-CoV 2015 and 2017 strains, most of the genomic RNA sequences of other coronaviruses showed
nucleotide mismatch higher than 20% with the designed primers. Thus, it is likely that the designed primer
sets would not amplify those sequences, ensuring the specificity of iNAATs for SARS-CoV-2. The results of
in silico PCR and a virtual LAMP tool (Electric LAMP [51]) also supported the high specificity of primer
sets used (SI2 file). Further data demonstrated that the iNAATs primer sets designed selectively detected the
presence of SARS-CoV-2 DNA while no cross-reactivity was observed with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, bat
SARS-like-CoV (Fig. 2) and some other coronaviruses (Fig. S2, SI1 file), confirming the absolute specificity
of the assays.

Limit of detection of colorimetric iNAATs
The LOD values of iNAAT reactions were determined using synthesized DNA templates serially
diluted in nuclease-free water. As shown in Fig. 3A and B, roughly a single copy of the synthesized targeted
gene per reaction was the lowest template amount that iNAAT reaction can detect. As for PSR, the LOD of
the reaction targeting the ORF1ab sequence was 103 copies/reaction (Fig. 3C). The obtained results indicated

that the iNAAT reactions containing primer pairs designed for LAMP, CPA and PSR targeting N-sequence
were sensitive enough for the practical diagnosis.

Figure 3. The LOD values for the targeted genes of colorimetric iNAATs. LOD of LAMP (in A), CPA
(in B) and PSR (in C) assay were evaluated. The synthesized DNA template was serially diluted in nucleasefree water to the indicated concentrations and 1 µl of the diluted DNA templates was added to the reactions.
The experiments were replicated at least 3 times.
The genomic RNA of SARS-CoV-2 was extracted and quantitated using the standard curve based on
qRT-PCR Ct-value as described in the previous study [49]. The LODs of the colorimetric iNAATs on this
extracted SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA were also evaluated, revealing the LOD values of LAMP reactions
were around 21.57 (ORF1ab) and 43.14 (N) viral-RNA copies/reaction (Table 3). The obtained values were
outstanding compared to 431.47 and 862.9 genome copies/reaction of CPA and PSR assays, respectively
(Table 3).

Performance of direct SARS-CoV-2 colorimetric iNAATs with simulated clinical specimens
The activity of the isothermal polymerase utilized in LAMP, CPA and PSR is more tolerant to various
PCR inhibitors such as trace quantities of whole-blood, hemin, urine or stools [28, 52, 53]. Therefore, we
attempted to use these iNAATs to directly detect SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid from nasopharyngeal and
oropharyngeal swab specimens. Synthesized DNAs of SARS-CoV-2 were spiked into the crude samples to
mimic the clinical specimens. Unfortunately, the direct use of undiluted crude samples interfered with the
color indicator of the iNAATs; the reaction color changed to yellow immediately when samples were added.
As expected, sample dilution was required to clearly establish the colorimetric reactions between positive
and negative signals (data not shown). Accordingly, a 10-fold dilution of nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal
swab specimens, which was sufficient to distinguish the colors between positive and negative samples, was
selected to examine the simulated clinical specimens prepared.

Figure 4. The direct iNAATs for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in simulated samples. Different amounts of the
synthetic-DNA template were spiked into the nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab samples to simulate
the clinical samples containing SARS-CoV-2, and 1 µl of the 10-fold diluted specimens was added to the
LAMP (in A), CPA (in B) and PSR (in C) reactions. The number indicates the copy of template per reaction.
Abbreviation, N: negative control; P: positive control.
As a result, all nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab samples without spiked DNA produced
negative signals while the samples containing a various number of spiked DNAs produced positive signals
(Fig. 4), indicating that iNAATs successfully detected the nucleic acid of SARS-CoV-2 in crude specimens.
Among the three methods, based on the best performance on detecting genomic RNA of SARS-CoV-2,
LAMP assay was used for further evaluation with simulated clinical samples varied in the amounts of spiked
viral-RNAs. Note that instead of transferring 1 µl of the 10-fold diluted samples to the reaction, 5 µl of the
spiked viral-RNA specimens were added to the reaction. Thus, a 50-fold dilution of the simulated specimens
was prepared proportionally. The results indicated that the LAMP assays can directly detect SARS-CoV-2
genomic-RNA in crude samples (Fig. 5), supporting the success of the direct SARS-CoV-2 colorimetric
LAMP assay designed.

samples. Various concentrations of genomic RNA of SARS-CoV-2 were spiked into the nasopharyngeal and

Performance of SARS-CoV-2 colorimetric LAMP using lyophilized reagents
For better on-site testing, lyophilized reagents that are ready-to-use without strict storage conditions at
low temperature would be highly advantageous. Thus, we also evaluated the LAMP kit performance using
the dried reagents. The lyophilized kit exhibited the same LOD value of 1 DNA copy/reaction, which is
equivalent to 10 DNA copies/µl in simulated specimens (Fig. 6A). Subsequently, the LOD values of
lyophilized LAMP kit for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA were also evaluated. Both primer
sets could identify approximately 43.14 copies of viral RNA per reaction (Table 3). Note that the LOD
values defined correspond to a Ct value of roughly 36.5 when tested by qRT-PCR for the E gene [49]. This
high Ct value (>35) strongly indicates that the designed lyophilized LAMP kit could identify the specimens
with low-level infection of SARS-CoV-2 found during early infection or asymptomatic carriage.
Importantly, all mimicked samples containing different amounts of synthesized DNA or viral RNA were
detected by the lyophilized LAMP kit (Fig. 6B and C). The direct addition of unextracted clinical specimens
to the reaction can markedly reduce the time required for sample preparation and thus, simplify the operation
procedure. When all those features are considered, the lyophilized LAMP kit is highly suitable for POC
diagnosis.

DISCUSSION
The pneumonia outbreak COVID-19 has recently become a global pandemic. While there has been not
a commercial vaccine or efficient chemotherapeutics successfully developed, rapid diagnosis and necessary
biosecurity procedures are the most essential actions to control the disease. POC such as airports or stations
should be strictly managed to avoid spreading COVID-19. However, the prevention measures including body
heat monitoring, checking personal travel history and clinical symptoms have been proven to be insufficient
as many asymptomatic people are infectious [54-57]. Self-isolation and group quarantine of suspected cases
can temporarily limit the transmission, but it will be more difficult to control when the number of suspects is
high. While the gold standard for identifying the patients is qRT-PCR, the standard operating procedure of
diagnosis including preparation of master mix, extraction of nucleic acid template and requirement of
expensive qRT-PCR devices to examine multiple specimens simultaneously is not highly portable.
Moreover, the testing time required is at least a few hours, if not including the time needed for transferring
the sample to the labs, thus, slowing down the quarantine process of the infected patient. Consequently, the
qRT-PCR tests only serve to verify a small number of cases while the actions cannot be made immediately.

Therefore, POC diagnostic detection methods that are rapid and accurate can help the authority to effectively
monitor the spreading of the virus.
The three isothermal amplification methods interested including LAMP, CPA and PSR all require the
DNA polymerase strand displacement activity. Among them, LAMP was first introduced and has been
widely utilized [25, 26, 58]. Meanwhile, CPA and PSR were later developed and studies have shown that
their performance was comparable to LAMP assay [38-42]. Moreover, since the robust amplified process of
LAMP, CPA and PSR techniques induces the proton release which significantly drops the pH of reaction,
allowing the reaction outcome can be easily read by the naked eye with the use of an economic pH-sensitive
indicator, thus simplifying the handling process and reducing the cost of assays. In contrast, detection based
on the pH change is more limited for PCR or other isothermal methods such as RPA (Recombinase
polymerase amplification) or HDA (Helicase-dependent amplification). In response to the COVID-19
pandemic, multiple LAMP assays were introduced and evaluated to rapidly detect SARS-CoV-2 in patient
samples [12-15, 17]. In this work, for the first time, the three methods including LAMP. CPA and PSR were
applied to detect SARS-CoV-2 to compare their effectiveness. Surprisingly, despite showing similar
performance regarding the identification of the synthetic DNA template of SARS-CoV-2, LAMP was
superior to CPA and PSR in the detection of genomic RNA of SARS-CoV-2. The finding indicates that
LAMP is the best among the three isothermal techniques evaluated to be used as the diagnostic method for
the identification of SARS-CoV-2 in practice. This is consistent with the fact that many recent studies have
attempted to develop LAMP assays for COVID-19 diagnosis [12-15, 17].
One of the most distinctive features of the SARS-CoV-2 colorimetric LAMP kit developed herein is
the direct use of minimally processed clinical samples. The only step required to prepare samples before
adding to the reaction is simple dilution. The study was inspired by different previous results showing that
LAMP was successfully conducted in crude clinical specimens without sample extraction [59, 60]. We
speculate that the crude samples already contained some free viral RNA and that the moderately high
temperature (60 °C) of the incubation process could help to break the virus envelop, thereby releasing more
genomic RNA into the solution. To our knowledge, initially, this work had been one of the first few reports
attempting to develop the RT-LAMP assay for SARS-CoV-2 detection using unextracted nasopharyngeal
and oropharyngeal swab specimens. Recently, several works also proved that RT-LAMP can directly detect
the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in unextracted clinical samples [17, 61], further corroborating our findings.
Without the requirement for viral RNA extraction, the colorimetric lyophilized LAMP kit developed is very
suitable for on-site diagnosis, not only because it is much less time-consuming and laborious but also does
not depend on RNA extraction kits that have been in shortage due to overwhelming global demand.
In general, the colorimetric lyophilized RT-LAMP kit developed in this study possesses the following
features: (i) fast detection of SARS-CoV-2 genomic-RNA directly from the nasopharyngeal and
oropharyngeal specimens within 45 minutes; (ii) high sensitivity (roughly 43 copies of the viral RNA in the
reaction is sufficient for detection); (iii) naked-eye readout of results; (iv) possible detection of the virus in
the early stage of infection; (v) only a common thermal incubator is needed; (vi) is amenable to high
throughput testing; (vii) portable to use in any place and does not require specialized personnel to do the test;
and (viii) particularly useful for resource-limited settings. This RT-LAMP kit is hence more scalable for
mass testing and a promising candidate for POC diagnosis of COVID-19.
The colorimetric direct RT-LAMP method established here has been developed into ready-to-use kits.
Because the number of COVID-19 patients in Vietnam was limited and the clinical COVID-19 specimens
were not accessible, the authors were unable to carry out clinical trials for the kit in Vietnam. Thus, we
collaborated with the researchers at Universitas Indonesia in Indonesia in an attempt to validate our kits. The
initial data obtained by our collaborators revealed that the sensitivity and specificity of the kits were both
over 80% (personal communication). The obtained data adamantly support that the direct RT-LAMP kit
developed in this study is suitable for practical use as a rapid screening method for COVID-19 patients. The
positive cases can be further tested by qRT-PCR to verify the results. This result sets a solid foundation for
future extensive clinical trials of our kit.

CONCLUSION
In this study, the colorimetric iNAATs for SARS-CoV-2 detection based on three methods including
LAMP, CPA, and PSR were developed and compared the testing performance. The results indicated that
iNAATs could directly identify the genomic RNA of SARS-CoV-2 in unextracted patient specimens. The
results can be easily observed with the naked eye within 45 minutes, without cross-reactivity to closely
related coronaviruses. However, LAMP outperformed both CPA and PSR, exhibiting the best LOD value of
approximately 43.14 genome copies per reaction. Additionally, the ready-to-use lyophilized reagents for
LAMP reactions maintained the testing performance of the liquid assays, showing that the colorimetric
lyophilized LAMP kit developed for detecting SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids is feasible for POC diagnosis
settings.
