Abstract
In April 2020, respiratory disease and increased mortality were observed in farmed mink on
two farms in the Netherlands. In both farms, at least one worker had been found positive for
SARS-CoV-2. Necropsies of the mink revealed interstitial pneumonia, and organ and swab
samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by qPCR. Variations in viral genomes point at
between-mink transmission on the farms and lack of infection link between the farms. Inhalable
dust in the mink houses contained viral RNA, indicating possible exposure of workers.

Introduction
Currently, humanity is facing a pandemic of a new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 (Severe acute
respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2). The virus is spreading efficiently among people, causing
predominantly respiratory disease with varying degree of severity. The virus was also shown
to infect a number of animal species under experimental conditions. Rhesus and cynomolgus
macaques, ferrets, cats and golden Syrian hamsters supported viral replication in respiratory
tract [1-9] and some of those species (rhesus macaques, juvenile cats and hamsters) displayed
a mild to moderate clinical disease. Besides the experimental infections, occasional spill-over
from humans to domestic or captive animals has been reported. In a few isolated cases cats and
dogs owned by infected individuals tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA [10, 11], and
occasionally, cats also displayed clinical disease. Recently, several tigers in the Bronx zoo with
respiratory symptoms were confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2. In all cases a direct
correlation with infected humans was established, or at least other sources of infection were
excluded [10].

Here, we report SARS-CoV-2 infection of mink on two farms in the Netherlands, and describe
the associated clinical signs, pathological and virological findings. Sequence analysis of minkderived viruses imply the role of SARS-CoV-2-positive humans as a probable source of the
initial infection, point at transmission between mink and reveal possible exposure of workers
to virus excreted by mink in the environment.

Disease history and clinical observations
On 19 and 20 of April 2020, signs of respiratory disease were reported on two mink farms (NB1
with two closely situated locations: NB1a and NB1b, and NB2) in the Netherlands, province
Noord Brabant. The respiratory signs were mostly limited to watery nasal discharge, but some
animals showed severe respiratory distress. Overall mortality between date of reporting and 30
of April was 2.4% at NB1 and 1.2% at NB2, while approximately 0.6% would have been
expected. Affected animals were spread throughout the farms. At this time of the year, the mink
populations consist mainly of pregnant females. In the few litters that were already present, no
increase in pup mortality was noticed.
Lungs from three recently died animals per farm were collected and submitted for qPCR
analysis on 21 (NB1) and 25 (NB2) of April. One sample per farm was also sequenced (index
samples). In the following week, thirty-six recently dead animals were collected (18 per farm)
and necropsied. A throat and rectal swab were taken from each animal for qPCR analysis.

Pathological analysis
Macroscopic findings. The necropsies revealed that 16/18 animals from NB1 and 12/18 from
NB2 had diffusely dark to mottled red, wet lung lobes that did not collapse when opening the
thoracic cavity, indicating interstitial pneumonia (Table 1 and Figure 1A). Other investigated
organs displayed no significant macroscopic changes. Mink without the described lung findings
had macroscopic changes consistent with either chronic Aleutian disease, septicaemia, or
dystocia. From 7 animals with clear macroscopic lung changes, organs were harvested for
histopathological and virological investigation.
Histological findings. A severe diffuse interstitial pneumonia with hyperaemia, alveolar
damage and loss of air containing alveolar lumina was detected in all the 7 harvested lungs
(Figure 1B). Bacterial cultures from the organs of the 7 animals were negative.

Virus detection and sequencing
Presence of viral RNA was determined by qPCR against the E gene (Table 2) [12]. Viral RNA
was detected in the conchae, lung, throat swab and rectal swab of all seven mink from which
organs were collected. In addition, viral RNA was detected in the liver of one, and in the
intestines of three animals. Spleens of all eight animals were negative for viral RNA (Table 2).
In the swabs collected from all 36 necropsied animals, viral RNA was detected in all throat

swabs and 34/36 of the rectal swabs. The Ct values varied, but on average were lower in the
throat swabs, as compared to the rectal swabs (average Ct 21.7 and 31.2 respectively),
indicating higher viral loads in the throat swabs.
The viral sequences of the index samples and from additional four and five animals from NB1
and NB2 respectively, were determined by NGS and deposited in GenBank (MT396266 and
MT457390 – MT457399). Phylogenetic analysis of the sequences suggests two separate
introductions into the two farms (Figure 2). The index sequences show 9 (NB1) and 15 (NB2)
nucleotide substitutions over the complete genome in comparison with Wuhan-Hu-1
(NC_045512.2, EPI_ISL_402125). The two index sequences diverge at 22 nucleotide positions,
but the sequences from each farm cluster together. A deletion of 3 nucleotides at positions 16057 of all sequences from NB2 resulted in a deletion of an aspartic acid from Orf1ab (Asp447-).

Covid-19 history in farm workers
Farm owners and their families were interviewed by the public health service for possible
history of disease. One person on farm NB1 had disease symptoms since beginning of April,
but was not investigated for SARS-CoV-2 infection. At NB2, one worker had been diagnosed
with SARS-CoV-2 infection and hospitalized on 31st of March 31. A clinical sample was
retrieved, but the viral load was too low for sequencing analysis. The follow-up investigation
is ongoing and will be reported elsewhere.

Environmental sampling
Inhalable dust in the air was collected at three locations in each of the mink houses between
28th of April and 2nd of May by active stationary sampling during 5-6 hours, using Gilian GilAir
5 pumps at 3.5 L/min, GSP sampling heads and Teflon filters. Viral RNA was detected in 2/3
samples of NB1a (Ct 35.95 and 38.18), 1/3 of NB1b (Ct 35.03) and 1/3 of NB2 (Ct 35.14).

Discussion
Here we present the first report of infection of two mink farms with SARS-CoV-2. In both
farms, Covid-19 like symptoms were present in individuals working on the farms before signs
in mink were seen, and infection was confirmed in one hospitalized person. The sequences
obtained from the two farms are closely related to known human sequences, and the distance
between the sequence clusters from the two farms suggests separate introductions. The most
likely explanation of the widespread infection in the mink farms is introduction of the virus by
humans and subsequent transmission amongst the minks. In the mink farms, the animals are
caged separately with non-permeable partition between cages, precluding direct contact as a
mode of transmission. Indirect transmission between minks could either be through fomites
(e.g. by feed or bedding material provided by humans), by infectious droplets generated by the
infected animals, or by (fecally-) contaminated dust from the bedding. Detection of viral RNA

in the airborne inhalable dust in the mink farms clearly suggests dust and/or droplets as means
of transmission between the minks and occupational risk of exposure for the workers on the
farms.
In conclusion, this report shows the first SARS-CoV-2 virus outbreak in farmed mink. We
demonstrate that mink are susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2 virus, may develop
respiratory disease with typical pathological findings of viral pneumonia, and can transmit the
virus amongst each other. Moreover, humans working in the mink houses are exposed to virus,
indicating the need for infection prevention among workers and other biosecurity measures to
prevent onward spread of the virus from the affected mink farms.
