Abstract

15

Human Angiotensin I Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) that acts as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry

16

is highly expressed in human type II pneumocytes and enterocytes and similarly in other

17

mammals and zebrafish (Danio rerio). The zebrafish genome has a highly conserved, one-to-one

18

ortholog of ACE2, i.e., ace2, whose expression profile however has not yet been studied during

19

development or in pathologies relevant to COVID-19. Herein, we identified significant

20

development-, tissue- and gender-specific modulations in ace2 expression based on meta-

21

analysis of zebrafish Affymetrix transcriptomics datasets (ndatasets=107, GPL1319 in GEO

22

database). Co-expression network analysis of ace2 revealed distinct positively correlated

23

(carboxypeptidase activity and fibrin clot formation), and negatively correlated (cilia

24

biogenesis/transport and chromatin modifications) STRING network modules. Using additional

25

transcriptomics datasets, we showed zebrafish embryos before 3 days post fertilization (dpf)

26

exhibited low levels of ace2 that increased significantly until 4 dpf implicating a role for ace2 in

27

organogenesis. Re-analysis of RNA-seq datasets from zebrafish adult tissues demonstrated ace2

28

was expressed highly in intestines, variably in liver, and at lower levels in other organs. In addition,

29

zebrafish females and males showed significant dimorphism in their age-dependent expression

of ace2, and between ovary and testis where the latter had higher levels. Moreover, we

31

demonstrated ace2 expression was significantly modulated under different physiological and

32

pathological conditions associated with development, diet, infection, and inflammation. Our

33

findings implicate a novel translational role for zebrafish ace2 in differentiation and pathologies

34

predominantly found in intestines and liver, in which the effects of SARS-CoV-2 could be

detrimental.

INTRODUCTION

37

ACE2 and ACE, involved in angiotensin conversion, are integral elements of renin-angiotensin

38

signaling (RAS) in multiple tissues. Recent studies have shown that RAS is not only present in

39

kidney or adrenal glands but also functional in other tissues with significant roles in multiple

40

pathologies including cancer (Cheng and Liu, 2019; Nehme et al., 2019; Pinter and Jain, 2017;

41

Rasha et al., 2019). The role of ACE2 and ACE in the regulation of hypertension is well known

42

(Hamming et al., 2007) and recently ACE2 has become the focus of intense research due to its

43

function as a receptor of SARS-CoV-2 entry into the cell making it a highly sought after target in

44

the prevention and therapy of COVID-19 (Wan et al., 2020). Several mammalian models and

45

recently zebrafish have been used to study ACE2 expression and/or function.

46

Recent findings from single-cell RNA-seq studies show that ACE2 is highly expressed in type II

47

pneumocytes and intestinal enterocytes in mammals, in which SARS-CoV-2 can replicate and

48

disperse within the tissue of origin and possibly systemically (Ziegler et al., 2020). Moreover,

49

gender might be one of the factors leading to variability in ACE2 activity due to sex-specific

50

differences observed in the severity of viral infection and mortality rates (Jin et al., 2020). Since

51

ACE2 has roles in multiple tissues and functions in a wide range of physiological and pathological

52

conditions, understanding mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection has proven to be challenging.

53

Zebrafish ace2 is found highly conserved in sequence and structure, and exists as the only copy

54

in zebrafish with a duplicated genome (Chou et al., 2006). Furthermore, a recent study

55

phylogenetically comparing genes co-expressed with ace2 based on a zebrafish single-cell RNA-

56

seq tissue data has revealed RAS signaling is also highly conserved between humans and

57

zebrafish (Postlethwait et al., 2020). However, there is no study yet in the literature investigating

58

the changes in ace2 expression over zebrafish embryonic and larval developmental stages, and

59

in different whole adult tissues as well as across different genotypes and/or treatments. In

60

particular, potential sexual dimorphism between males and females over age as well as

61

pathologies relevant to SARS-CoV-2 infection warrant further study.

62

Herein, we have used bioinformatics approaches and the wealth of transcriptomics data in

63

literature to study the expression patterns of ace2 across various conditions. We first statistically

64

analyzed (two-group) a large collection of microarray datasets from the Affymetrix platform

65

(GPL1319) and identified development-, tissue-, and gender-specific differences in ace2

66

expression. Using additional datasets, we then showed that ace2 levels increased between 3 and

67

4 days post fertilization (dpf) and then remained high for the remainder of juvenile and adult life

68

of zebrafish although significant differences were observed between males and females during

69

young adulthood. ace2 exhibited high tissue specificity where it was expressed the most in

70

intestines followed by liver although highly variably. STRING network enrichment analyses

71

prioritized positively and negatively ranked local functional pathways and provided support as well

72

as novel leads for future studies. In addition, we showed that ace2 was modulated in different

73

models of liver and intestinal pathologies making the zebrafish model appropriate for SARS-CoV-

74

2 associated research, considering the gut being one of the transmission routes and liver a

75

potential end organ of COVID-19 pathogenesis (Lin et al., 2020).

76

METHODS

77

Collection and processing of Affymetrix Zebrafish Chip datasets (GPL1319)

78

Raw .CEL files for all available datasets for GPL1319 were obtained from NCBI GEO database

79

(Barrett et al., 2013). Groups containing at least two samples were used for comparisons; and

80

datasets with no comparable groups were excluded (ndatasets = 107). Normalization of .CEL files

81

for each study was performed, separately, using rma in affy package (Gautier et al., 2004). From

82

107 datasets, 344 two-group comparisons were manually generated with following rules: 1. each

83

experimental group was compared to its corresponding control group; 2. experimental groups with

84

double mutation or morpholino treatment were compared to each of the single mutation/morphant

85

group; 3. only control (or wild type) groups from different tissues, developmental time points or

86

gender were compared with each other; 4. for time series, all other groups were compared to the

87

group with the earliest time point only. Differential expression analysis using limma was conducted

88

for each of the manually generated two-group comparisons with the normalized datasets (Ritchie

89

et al., 2015). FDR and logarithmically (log2) transformed fold change (logFC) thresholds were set

90

stringently (adj. p value < 0.05 and abs(logFC) > 0.5).

94

https://www.cancergenomicscloud.org/). Reads were aligned using Star Alignment tool (Dobin et

95

al., 2013); and HTSeq tool (Anders et al., 2015) was used to retrieve count data. Raw count data

96

were normalized using RPKM function from edgeR package in R (McCarthy et al., 2012). Tau

97

was used as the tissue specificity index as described previously (Kryuchkova-Mostacci and

98

Robinson-Rechavi, 2017).

Dataset collection for sexual dimorphism, and intestinal and liver development and

101

Zebrafish transcriptomics datasets selected from NCBI GEO or Expression Atlas (Papatheodorou

102

et al., 2020) according to their relevance to sexual dimorphism, liver and gut development and

103

disease/treatments were summarized in Table S2. Series matrix files for datasets of GPL14664

104

(GSE113241 (Alvarez-Rodriguez et al., 2018), GSE112272 (Jia et al., 2019), GSE73233 (Forn-

105

Cuni et al., 2017), and GSE100583 (Holden and Brown, 2018)) and RPKM normalized data of

106

GSE74244 (Aramillo Irizar et al., 2018), GSE118076 (San et al., 2018), and GSE24616

107

(Domazet-Loso and Tautz, 2010) were obtained from GEO and used for statistical analysis after

108

logarithmic (base 2) transformation. The expression of ace2 in the E-ERAD-475 dataset was

109

obtained from Expression Atlas (White et al., 2017). ANOVA followed by multiple test correction

110

(Tukey's HSD) were used for statistical analyses as indicated in the Fig. legends. Raw count data

111

of GSE82200 (Koch et al., 2018), GSE83195 (Schall et al., 2017) and GSE123439 (Chen et al.,

112

2020b) were obtained from NCBI GEO; Deseq2 package was used for the differential gene

113

expression analysis; and Regularized log (Rlog) normalized expression values were used in

114

visualization (Love et al., 2014).

115

Enrichment Analysis

116

A Pearson’s correlation coefficient of ace2 (race2) was calculated between logFC values of ace2

117

and those of every other gene across all comparisons performed with GPL1319 datasets. race2

118

also was calculated for each gene based on log2 transformed expression values for larval

119

development, using GSE24616 (2 dpf-8 dpf) and GSE38575 (EtOH treated samples only; 2dpf -

120

7dpf) datasets; for intestine, using GSE35889 and GSE12189 (GFP+ samples only); and for liver,

121

using GSE74244 (liver samples only) and GSE100583, separately (Table S2). race2 value with

122

minimum p value was selected for multiple probe sets with the same Ensembl ID. Ensembl IDs

123

along with race2 values were used for identifying local network clusters using STRING enrichment

124

analysis with values for each of the above datasets (Szklarczyk et al., 2015). Comparative

125

Network Enrichment Analysis (CNEA) of Sting local networks were performed separately for

126

development, intestine and liver datasets. Enriched local networks with the largest gene set was

127

selected in the case of multiple local networks present with the same name. Significant networks

128

were clustered and visualized in Cytoscape (Shannon et al., 2003); where each node represented

129

a local network, colored according to STRING enrichment score (the mean enrichment score in

130

the case of liver and intestine comparisons), having edge weights determined by the number of

131

shared genes with other connected networks. Selected local networks were visualized in detail,

132

where each node on the PPI network obtained from STRING local network data referred to a gene

133

and was colored according to race2. In addition, GO term enrichment analysis was performed for

134

liver datasets using clusterprofiler package in R (Yu et al., 2012).

135

RESULTS

136

Analysis of zebrafish GPL1319 datasets reveal conditions in which ace2 expression is

137

significantly modulated

138

Upon re-analysis of publicly available datasets from the GPL1319 platform (n=107 with 344

139

pairwise group comparisons), ace2 expression was found differentially expressed in 19 pairwise

140

group comparisons from 11 different datasets relevant to sexual dimorphism, estrogen signaling,

141

embryogenesis, and liver and gut development (Table 1) (Froehlicher et al., 2009; Heiden et al.,

142

2008; Hu et al., 2013; Jacob et al., 2015; MacInnes et al., 2008; Okuda et al., 2010; Rogers et al.,

143

2011; Small et al., 2009; Soni et al., 2013; Stuckenholz et al., 2009; Thakur et al., 2014). STRING

144

local network clusters obtained using race2 calculated with logFC values from all comparisons

145

(n=344) revealed that genes positively correlated with ace2 were enriched in carboxypeptidase

146

activity, intestinal hexose absorption, villin and keratin, and fibrin clot formation associated sub-

147

groups (Figs. 1, S1A) whereas those negatively correlated belonged to cilium assembly,

148

microtubule organization pathways, and chromatin modifying enzymes (Figs. 1, S1B). Ten genes

149

were represented in GPL1319 platform out of 28 RAS pathway genes (Postlethwait et al., 2020);

150

and eight of them were found to be positively correlated with ace2, with a correlation coefficient

151

ranging from 0.46 to 0.85.

161

and E-ERAD-475 (Fig. S1C). In addition, we found ace2 was lowly expressed in embryogenesis

162

and started increasing at 3 dpf and thereafter until 4 dpf, after which was steadily expressed at

163

high levels (Figs. 2A, S1C). Analysis of yet another dataset (GSE38575) supported this finding of

164

an increase in ace2 expression after 3 dpf (Fig. 2B). STRING enrichment scores based on race2

165

between ace2 and every other gene obtained separately for GSE24616 (2dpf - 8dpf) and

166

GSE38575 (untreated; 2dpf - 7dpf) datasets were significantly correlated with each other (r =

167

0.963, p-value = 7.63e-127; Fig. 2A-C). Network clustering helped us define pathways modulated

168

at the time of ace2 induction in early zebrafish larvae. Accordingly, networks enriched with genes

169

positively correlated with ace2 belonged to pathways related to intestinal hexose absorption,

170

Vitamin D metabolism, carboxypeptidases, interleukin signaling, phenylalanine/tyrosine

171

catabolism, peptide ligand binding and dopamine receptors, phototransduction, and common

172

fibrin clot/fibrinolysis (Figs. 2D, S2). On the other hand, networks enriched with negatively

173

correlated genes included terms such as chromosome segregation, DNA double-strand break

174

and replication, homeobox, alternative splicing, and endothelial cell proliferation (Figs. 2D, S3,

175

Table S3).

176

ace2 expression in zebrafish is sexually dimorphic

177

One of the most prominent findings of the GPL1319 dataset meta-analysis was the identification

178

of sexual dimorphism in zebrafish ace2 expression as shown in Table 1 (GSE14979; Table 1).

179

Interestingly, gonads had lower ace2 expression when compared with the rest of the body

180

regardless of sex, while testis had relatively higher ace2 levels than the ovary (GSE14979; Fig.

181

S4A). Moreover, ace2 expression decreased in the presence of a morpholino for ERBeta2 (esr2a)

182

(GSE13158; Table 1), previously shown to be essential for female sexual maturation and early

183

follicle generation (Lu et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2020). We then re-analyzed the GSE24616 dataset

184

for ace2 expression in adult zebrafish through time and found ace2 was highly expressed in

185

juveniles and early adulthood (90 dpf) (Fig. 3A). Moreover, males exhibited high ace2 expression

186

regardless of age while females showed a steady decrease over aging until 9 months (Fig. 3A;

187

adj. p-value <0.0001 (age), adj. p-value <0.0001 (gender), adj. p-value = 0.43 (interaction));

188

however, after 9 months ace2 levels were indistinguishable between males and females. Results

189

obtained from another dataset, namely, GSE123439, was consistent with the observed

190

significance of sexual dimorphism in gonads (Fig. S4B).

191

ace2 exhibits the highest expression in intestines

192

In our meta-analysis of GPL1319 datasets, ace2 expression also increased the most in intestines

193

194

factor, under squamous epithelial cell specific krt5 promoter (GSE35889, Table 1). ace2

196

(Tg(XlEef1a1:GFP)s854) zebrafish larvae at and after 3 dpf compared to 2dpf (GSE12189,

197

Table1; Fig. S5A) while in GFP- (non-GIT) cells, ace2 was significantly upregulated at 6 dpf only.

198

Since ace2 expression also increased in GFP+ cells when compared to GFP- cells at 3 dpf

199

(GSE12189, Table1; Fig. S5A), we further performed comparative network enrichment analysis

200

(CNEA) of String local networks for GSE12189 and GSE35889. Network enrichment scores of

201

the abovementioned datasets were highly correlated (r = 0.798, p-value = 6.49e-12; Fig. S5B);

202

and top common networks included those of intestinal hexose absorption, chylomicron assembly,

203

i.e., a key mechanism for lipid transport in the intestines, common pathway of fibrin clot formation

204

and fibrinolysis, fatty acid degradation and carboxypeptidases (Figs. S5C, S6). On the other hand,

205

negatively correlated genes were enriched in networks of striated muscle contraction and mRNA

206

splicing (Figs. S5C, S6).

207

To support the role of ace2 in intestinal function and differentiation we next investigated the tissue

208

specificity of ace2 expression across multiple datasets we complied from RNA-seq experiments

209

(Fig. 3B; Table S1). Intestine and liver exhibited relatively high ace2 expression in comparison

210

with brain, gills, and kidney in that descending order (Fig. 3B). Accordingly, zebrafish ace2

211

expression was found to have a tissue specificity index value (Tau) of 0.99. Moreover, increases

212

in ace2 expression were steady over time in late zebrafish larvae with functional intestines (Fig.

213

S7A).

214

ace2 expression is altered with inflammation

215

From an intestinal disease perspective, ace2 was found to be downregulated in the zebrafish

216

model of Short Bowel Syndrome (SBS) (Fig. S7B) which may implicate a possible link between

217

ace2 expression and inflammatory response (Johnson et al., 2018; Mutanen et al., 2019; Schall

218

et al., 2017). We, therefore, re-analyzed selected expression datasets associated with different

219

inflammatory stimuli in zebrafish. No significant alteration in ace2 expression was observed in

220

response to bacterial colonization (Conventionalization (CONVD), Exiguobacterium (Exi) and

221

Chryseobacterium (Chrys)), or Spring Viraemia Carp Virus (SVCV) infection alone or in the

222

presence of immunostimulants (GSE113241, Fig. 4A; GSE73223, Fig. S7C). However, ace2

223

expression significantly increased with immunosuppression in the zebrafish myd88 knock-out

226

= 0.03 (interaction); Fig. 4A). On the other hand, ace2 expression decreased with SVCV infection

227

228

229

(pre-treatment), adj. p-value = 0.04 (interaction); Fig. 4B). LPS treatment was not effective in liver,

230

muscle, or kidney, either (Fig. S7C).

231

ace2 expression is highly variable in liver and associated with diet and liver disease

232

Since ace2 exhibited the second highest yet bimodal expression levels in liver (Fig. 3B; Fig. S8A),

233

we performed GO annotation of genes with high and low race2 values in GSE74244 (the largest

234

RNA-seq zebrafish cohort for zebrafish adult liver tissue in GEO database). Significant GO

235

biological processes of genes whose expression levels were positively correlated with that of ace2

236

were enriched in metabolism, and in particular, that of the lipid (Fig. S8B) whereas those

237

negatively correlated included immune response (Fig. S8C). We showed that liver expression

238

was not sexually dimorphic and could vary regardless of strain and gender using another dataset

239

(GSE100583, Fig. S9A). Results of GO enrichment analysis of GSE100583 were similar in terms

240

of positively correlated genes yet cilium organization and establishment of cell polarity were found

241

among significantly negatively correlated pathways (Fig. S9B, C). CNEA of STRING Local

242

Networks between these two independent datasets were highly concordant for a subset of

243

pathways (Fig. 5A, Fig. S10A) and included networks of genes with positive race2 such as intestinal

244

brush border proteins (villin and keratin) as well as interferon stimulated genes (ISG15 antiviral

245

mechanism),

246

phosphorylation (Figs. 5A, S10B). Erythropoietin and hemoglobin network was among those

247

enriched with negative race2 values in both datasets (Figs. 5A, S10B). However, apolipoprotein

248

A/E genes, known to be functional in fat metabolism and immune response, although enriched in

249

both datasets acted in the opposite direction (Fig. 5A).

250

We further investigated ace2 expression in zebrafish under conditions of fasting and refeeding in

251

the liver and found ace2 expression increased when refed after 3 weeks of fasting (Fig. 5B) yet it

252

was not altered when given a high carbohydrate diet (GSE8856 (Robison et al., 2008); logFC =

253

0.24, adj. p-value = 0.51 (females) and logFC = -0.67, adj. p-value = 0.99 (males)) or under the

254

condition of overfeeding (GSE48806 (unpublished data); logFC =-1.76, adj. p value = 0.26). In

255

further support of involvement of liver, ace2 expression decreased in the zebrafish non-alcoholic

256

fatty liver disease (NAFLD) model (GSE17711; Table 1) and in response to microcystin-LR,

Discussion

259

Zebrafish as a model organism is widely used to understand disease mechanisms due to its high

260

sequence/functional similarity with humans as well as the availability of a wide range of zebrafish

261

genetic models (Gomes and Mostowy, 2020; Logan et al., 2018; Mickiewicz et al., 2019;

262

Shehwana and Konu, 2019; Willis et al., 2016). ACE2, identified as the receptor allowing entry of

263

SARS-CoV-2 to the host cell, has a single ortholog in zebrafish with 65% identity (Chou et al.,

264

2006); and the RAS pathway in zebrafish has been shown to be similarly active as in humans

265

(Postlethwait et al., 2020). However how zebrafish ace2 expression changes in embryonic/larval

266

development or disease remains unexplored; hence, we investigated this using meta-analysis

267

and/or functional network enrichment approaches with respect to various contexts including age,

268

gender, tissue specificity and pathologies with relevance to COVID-19.

269

We have demonstrated that ace2 is expressed at low levels during early stages of larval

270

development yet starts increasing in expression during liver and intestinal differentiation (Kimmel

271

et al., 1995). Developmental studies in mice report Ace2 expression at E12.5 day with an

272

increasing trend over time in kidneys, lung, brain and heart (Song et al., 2012). ACE2 is also

273

expressed in human intestines, gonads, kidneys, heart, adipose tissue, lung, and liver in accord

274

with its multiorgan functionality (Musavi et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020). Herein based on re-

275

analysis of multiple transcriptomics datasets (both embryonic and adult), ace2 has been shown

276

to be tissue-specifically expressed in zebrafish adult intestines as in humans (Musavi et al., 2020).

277

The potential role of ace2 in zebrafish intestinal development is further supported by a drastic

278

increase in ace2 expression (logFC = 7.58) in the cdx1b transgenic exhibiting reduced squamous

279

epithelium at the expense of increased intestinal differentiation. This finding supports that cdx1b

280

could be a transcriptional regulator of ace2 in zebrafish as Cdx2 is in mice (Chen et al., 2020a).

281

Indeed, cdx1b is the functional ortholog of human CDX2, an important transcription factor with

282

known functions during digestive system development in humans (Cheng et al., 2008; Flores et

283

al., 2008; Silberg et al., 2000). In addition, fish larvae with a mutation in uhrf1 gene, reported to

284

cause non-functional intestines, also exhibit lower levels of ace2 further supporting a potential

285

role for ace2 in intestinal development (Table 1) (Ganz et al., 2019; Marjoram et al., 2015).

286

Herein, CNEA of STRING local networks (Yildiz et al., 2013) have proven to be an effective

287

strategy demonstrating that ace2 expression is a highly co-expressed component of

288

carboxypeptidases; this supports the reports proposing serine protease family of genes as a

289

target for COVID-19 treatment (reviewed in (Vargas et al., 2020; Yao et al., 2020)). Other

290

networks that warrant further attention in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection include fibrinolysis

291

(positive race2) since COVID-19 severity is associated with dysregulation of clot formation

292

(reviewed in (Coccheri, 2020)). Our findings also suggest that zebrafish can serve as a potential

293

model organism for testing effects of ace2 over- or under-expression as well as candidate drugs

294

(e.g., peptidase inhibitors) on enzymatic and complement activity in larval and adult intestines

295

under SARS-CoV-2 infection(Donmez et al., 2020).

296

Interestingly, several studies have previously reported a higher ACE2 expression in cilia of well

297

differentiated epithelial cells compared to undifferentiated cells (Jia et al., 2005; Lee et al., 2020b;

298

Wan et al., 2020). ACE2 expression level in cilia is also shown to correlate with SARS-CoV

299

infection (Lee et al., 2020b), and infection with coronavirus causes loss of cilia (Wan et al., 2020).

300

Most recently ACE2 has been shown to be expressed in motile cilia in airway epithelial cells in

301

humans (Lee et al., 2020a). In accord, herein we found genes negatively correlated with ace2

302

were enriched in cilia, intraflagellar transport, and microtubule organization, in particular, during

303

gastrointestinal development and intestinal differentiation. Further studies are needed to

304

understand the dynamicity between ace2 expression and cilium assembly; and zebrafish provides

305

an effective translational model for testing potential drugs affecting intraflagellar transport in the

306

context of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Duan et al., 2020).

307

Consistently, our analyses of race2 in zebrafish have pointed to the enrichment of respiratory chain

308

related networks. In support of this, Ace2 knockout mice has been reported to exhibit disrupted

309

mitochondrial function in pancreatic islets and skeletal muscle cells (Cao et al., 2019; Shi et al.,

310

2018). Transcriptomic analyses with human cornea, retina and lung datasets propose ace2 is

311

highly co-expressed with mitochondrial genes (Yuan et al., 2020). Indeed, Ang II is known to

312

activate NADPH and can stimulate an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) in renal cells

313

while ACE2, as a negative regulator of Ang II, has a protective role against ROS (Gava et al.,

314

2009; Gwathmey et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2012). Ace2 knockout mice also exhibit increased insulin

315

resistance which can lead to hepatic stress along with increased oxidative stress in accordance

316

with Mas knockout mice (Cao et al., 2014; Gallagher et al., 2008; Gwathmey et al., 2010; Song

317

et al., 2020). Zebrafish can serve as a model organism to study the potential link between the

318

modulatory role of ACE2 in mitochondrial function and adverse effects of diabetes on COVID-19

319

prognosis.

320

Our analyses have indicated liver as the second highest ace2 expressing tissue in zebrafish yet

321

with a clear bimodal pattern regardless of age (6 months – 42 months) or gender. The functional

322

distinction between adult livers expressing ace2 at lower or higher levels has become a question

323

of interest and our comparative functional enrichment methodologies provide potential answers.

324

GO enrichment analyses of ace2’s positively co-expressed genes reveal the involvement of lipid

325

catabolism as a potential discriminator; in support of this, we have shown that ace2 levels

326

decrease in response to microcystin-LR, a common form of cyanotoxin that is reported to cause

327

liver damage as well as disruption of lipid metabolism (Liu et al., 2014; Woolbright et al., 2017).

328

This finding may have translational implications and warrants further examination since the rates

329

of severity and morbidity in COVID-19 increase with obesity (BMI>25) (Kruglikov et al., 2020).

330

Indeed, our identification of steadily increased ace2 expression in zebrafish refed liver after fasting

331

aids into the connection between ace2 expression and diet. For instance, Ace2 levels also have

332

been shown to be elevated in high-fat fed mouse and rat (Gupte et al., 2008; Shoemaker et al.,

333

2019; Zhang et al., 2014), however not in the initial response to lipid exposure in zebrafish

334

digestive organs (Zeituni et al., 2016). This suggests that further experiments are needed to

335

identify the time-frame diet can alter ace2 levels in zebrafish. In our re-analysis, we also have

336

found ace2 levels decrease in the NAFLD zebrafish model, in accord with mouse data in literature

337

(Cao et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2020). Interestingly an increasing number of studies shows the

338

inverse relation between NAFLD and COVID-19 recovery (Duan et al., 2020; Forlano et al., 2020;

339

Huang et al., 2020; Mahamid et al., 2020). Our findings indicate that increased oxidative

340

phosphorylation as well as altered lipid metabolism, also observed in obesity, might be associated

341

with increased ace2 levels in liver, an end organ in COVID-19 (Jothimani et al., 2020; Pawlotsky,

342

2020), and might have a role in modulating the disease severity.

343

In addition to altered lipid metabolism, interferon pathway modulation (ISG15 antiviral mechanism

344

network) has arisen as a discriminator of low and high ace2 expressing liver in zebrafish.

345

Interestingly, studies with SARS-CoV-2 reported ACE2 as an interferon stimulated gene (ISG) in

346

humans (Chua et al., 2020; Ziegler et al., 2020). Liver, an organ continually subjected to food

347

antigens and pathogens from intestines, can respond to such activators of immune response

348

readily with its residential macrophages (Bleriot and Ginhoux, 2019); and this may result in highly

349

variable interferon activity in the liver (reviewed in (Robinson et al., 2016)). Future studies focusing

350

on embryonic and tissue-specific ace2 knockout and overexpression models can help understand

351

the role of adaptive and innate immune system challenges in zebrafish liver expression variability.

352

Moreover, a prognostic importance for Vitamin D has been shown in COVID-19 such that vitamin

353

D exposure potentially increases ACE2 levels as well as reducing the risk for cytokine storm

354

(Benskin, 2020; Bleizgys, 2020; Musavi et al., 2020). Herein we have identified a significant

355

decrease in ace2 levels in response to Vitamin D treatment during early larval and organ

356

development that can serve as an important model to investigate the mechanism behind the

357

association between Vitamin D levels and ace2 expression.

358

The observed decrease in ace2 expression in the zebrafish SBS model is also intriguing and

359

points to a link between decreased levels of ace2 and inflammation as widely observed in human

360

SBS patients (Schall et al., 2017). Our re-analysis has shown that zebrafish uhrf1 and cdipt

361

mutants with elevated intestinal inflammation both exhibit a significant decrease in ace2

362

expression (Marjoram et al., 2015; Thakur et al., 2014). In human inflammatory bowel disease

363

(IBD) ACE2 levels exhibit a similar decrease in inflamed ileum yet increases in inflamed colon

364

and rectum (Suarez-Farinas et al., 2020; Verstockt et al., 2020). Interestingly, patients with IBD

365

along with other inflammatory diseases might have lower susceptibility to COVID-19 (Suarez-

366

Farinas et al., 2020; Verstockt et al., 2020). Furthermore, a strong association has emerged

367

between pathways related to COVID-19 and those of IBD (Suarez-Farinas et al., 2020). In support

368

of the link between ace2 levels and inflammatory pathways, our meta-analysis shows that

369

zebrafish embryos deficient in the key innate immunity regulatory factor myd88 exhibit altered

370

lipid metabolism while expressing ace2 highly, regardless of the type of microbiome (Koch et al.,

371

2018). Interestingly, in mouse, MyD88 is shown to be essential in protection against SARS-CoV

372

through activation of NF-κB pathway upon viral infection (Hirano and Murakami, 2020; Sheahan

373

et al., 2008), which needs to be tested in zebrafish immune deficiency models. Moreover, our

374

bioinformatics analyses show that preexposure to immune suppressive and lipid modulatory

375

agent β-glucans may lower ace2 levels (AbuMweis et al., 2010) supporting that the increased

376

fatty acid synthesis might inhibit immune response (Yaqoob and Calder, 2007), and possibly ace2

377

levels in zebrafish.

378

Although the mortality risk of COVID-19 is relatively higher in males than females, there is no

379

concurrent evidence to link the sexual dimorphic effect of COVID-19 to the disease mechanism

380

and the role ACE2 expression might play in humans. Indeed, analysis of human tissue ACE2

381

expression has indicated no significant difference between males and females in general while

382

testis is shown to have higher expression than the ovary (Musavi et al., 2020). Our findings in the

383

present study points to a sexually dimorphic expression pattern of ace2 in zebrafish, which can

384

provide a model for studying gender specific ace2 expression in response to different drugs to be

385

tested for COVID-19 treatment.

386

Moreover, esr2a along with estrogen level play important roles in zebrafish starting from early

387

developmental stages as well as during sexual maturation; and esr2a knockout zebrafish broods

388

exhibit a significantly lower female to male ratio (Lu et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2020). This finding

389

implicates esr2a, as a potential modulator of ace2 expression and can also be studied in other

390

animal models. In addition, the sexual dimorphism observed in ace2 levels is more prominent

391

before one year of age at which the females are at their most fertile stage may indicate a role for

392

estrogen signaling in regulation of ace2 expression. Our results showing a decrease in ace2

393

expression in the zebrafish models of esr2a knock-down and TCDD exposure, an environmental

394

toxicant acting as an estrogen inhibitor, might help explain gender-specific protective influence of

395

estrogen against the COVID-19 infection-mediated or inherent upregulation of ACE2 expression.

396

In conclusion, COVID-19 is a multiorgan disease affecting lungs, kidney, intestines, and liver

397

primarily and recent studies suggest possible impact on other tissues including retina and brain

398

(Noris et al., 2020; Stein and Young, 2020; Zaim et al., 2020). Tissue and context-dependent

399

expression of ace2 in zebrafish correlate well with human, primate, and rodent data as exemplified

400

above. Therefore, zebrafish with its high translational potency can serve as an effective model

401

organism for COVID-19 research while our comprehensive bioinformatics and statistical analyses

402

provide novel physiological and pathological implications to follow up.
