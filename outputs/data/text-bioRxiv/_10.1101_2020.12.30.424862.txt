Abstract
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has emerged as a major global health threat. The
COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in over 80 million cases and 1.7 million deaths to date while
the number of cases continues to rise. With limited therapeutic options, the identification of safe
and effective therapeutics is urgently needed. The repurposing of known clinical compounds
holds the potential for rapid identification of drugs effective against SARS-CoV-2. Here we
utilized a library of FDA-approved and well-studied preclinical and clinical compounds to screen
for antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 in human pulmonary epithelial cells. We identified 13
compounds that exhibit potent antiviral activity across multiple orthogonal assays. Hits include
known antivirals, compounds with anti-inflammatory activity, and compounds targeting host
pathways such as kinases and proteases critical for SARS-CoV-2 replication. We identified
seven compounds not previously reported to have activity against SARS-CoV-2, including B02,
a human RAD51 inhibitor. We further demonstrated that B02 exhibits synergy with remdesivir,
the only antiviral approved by the FDA to treat COVID-19, highlighting the potential for
combination therapy. Taken together, our comparative compound screening strategy highlights
the potential of drug repurposing screens to identify novel starting points for development of
effective antiviral mono- or combination therapies to treat COVID-19.

Introduction
Zoonotic viruses pose a great public health challenge due to the unpredictable nature of an
outbreak, the potential to impact an immune-naïve population, and a lack of therapeutic options
(1, 2). Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the emergence of the severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a member of the Coronaviridae family
within the Betacoronavirus genus (3-5). The Betacoronavirus genus contains several seasonal
human pathogens that cause mild disease, as well as the recently emerged severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome
coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (4). SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV cause severe disease
in humans. The increased magnitude of the current pandemic relative to SARS-CoV and
MERS-CoV may be explained by increased human-human transmissibility from frequent
asymptomatic shedding of this virus (6-9). Severe cases of COVID-19 are associated with acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) triggered by an inflammatory response resulting in tissue
damage and fluid accumulation in the lungs (10-12). Currently there are limited options to treat
patients suffering from severe COVID-19. The sole FDA-approved antiviral compound for
COVID-19 treatment is remdesivir, but clinical efficacy is modest and no conclusive effect on
patient mortality has been found (13-16). Although remdesivir exhibits strong in vitro efficacy
against SARS-CoV-2 infection, its low exposure in target lung tissue, dose-limiting kidney and
liver toxicity, and the need for intravenous administration make early and effective clinical
treatment difficult (17-20). Consequently, the rapid discovery and development of additional
therapeutics is vital.

Repurposing well-studied preclinical, clinical, and approved compounds holds the greatest
potential to swiftly move a drug candidate from the bench to the clinic. An FDA-approved
compound library (TargetMol L4200) and a bioactive compound library (TargetMol L4000) are
two collections of well-studied compounds, many of which already possess extensive human

safety data. Here, we screened both libraries to identify compounds that inhibit SARS-CoV-2
replication in host cells. We report the identification of 13 compounds effective against SARSCoV-2, 7 of which are previously unreported. Of note, a host-directed compound, the cyclindependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor dinaciclib, was determined to be more potent than remdesivir
in limiting viral replication in human lung epithelial cells. Additional hit compounds include: i)
known antivirals predicted to target SARS-CoV-2 viral factors directly; ii) host protein kinase and
protease inhibitors; and iii) and anti-inflammatory agents. Further, we identify antiviral synergy
between remdesivir and the RAD51 inhibitor B02, opening the possibility of clinical combination
therapy. Taken together, our results identify several novel starting points for COVID-19 drug
development which hold the potential to alleviate the current global pandemic.

Results
Identification of SARS-CoV-2 permissive cell lines for drug screening.
To design a screen for identification of SARS-CoV-2 antiviral compounds, we first tested a panel
of 16 cell lines to identify cells capable of sustaining robust SARS-CoV-2 replication. These cell
lines included human pulmonary epithelial and endothelial cells, keratinocytes, hepatocytes, and
primate cells, among others (Figure 1 and Figure S1). Multi-step growth curves of SARS-CoV2 in each of these cell lines revealed a range of permissiveness to viral infection (summarized in
Table 1). We found distinct cell infection patterns including highly permissive for viral replication
(Figure 1A-D) with and without significant cytopathic effect (CPE) (Table 1), mildly permissive
with no CPE (Figure S1, Table 1), as well as non-permissive defined by lack of detectable
infectious virus measured by a median tissue culture infectious dose assay (TCID50) (Figure
S1, Table 1). We selected the human pulmonary epithelial cell line Calu-3 and the African
Green Monkey kidney cell line Vero-E6 for conducting the primary screens, as these cell types
supported high levels of infection with dramatic CPE, ideal features for drug screening (Figure

1A and 1B). We further reasoned that selection of two distinct cell lines would control for cellspecific effects of a given compound.

A cytopathic effect-based screening platform to identify SARS-CoV-2 antiviral
compounds from the FDA-approved and bioactive compound libraries.
We screened a library of 1,200 FDA approved compounds (FDA-approved library) and a library
of 2,834 pre-clinical compounds and 1,336 compounds with human clinical data (bioactive
library, Figure S2A). For the primary screen, we developed a CPE-based screening assay
(CellTiter-Glo, CTG) which uses ATP released from viable cells to drive a luciferase reporter
(RLU). This assay identifies drugs that are potent enough to inhibit SARS-CoV-2-mediated cell
death, thus selecting for compounds whose antiviral effects are present over several viral
lifecycles. Cells are treated with compound immediately prior to infection with SARS-CoV-2 and
incubated until complete CPE is observed in infected vehicle treated wells, at which time cell
viability is determined using the CTG assay (Figure 2A). We used both Calu-3 and Vero-E6
cells to identify possible cell type dependent effects of each compound. We observed significant
separation in signal between infected and uninfected wells in Vero-E6 cells at day 3 postinfection (Figure 2B, Z’=0.47) and in Calu-3 cells at day 4 post-infection (Figure 2C, Z’=0.43),
demonstrating that the assay was suitable for high-throughput screening. Remdesivir served as
a positive control in this assay, with EC50 values of 0.7-3µM (Figure S2B, S2C). For primary
screens, three identical 384-well daughter plates were generated at a final compound
concentration of 40 µM. Two plates served as technical replicates that were infected with SARSCoV-2, while the third functioned as an uninfected cell cytotoxicity control (Figure 2A).

To enable comparative analysis, we ran two parallel screens using the FDA-approved
compound library on both Vero-E6 and Calu-3 cells. These screens revealed numerous
compounds that significantly inhibited CPE in both cell types without causing significant

cytotoxicity in uninfected cells (Figure 2D-F). Intriguingly, although some compounds displayed
overlapping antiviral activity in both cell lines, the majority displayed cell specific antiviral activity
(Figure 2F). These observations could be explained by species-specific or cell type-specific
mechanisms of action of a given compound, or by differences in viral replication between the
two cell types. Because we observed cell type-specific effects of compounds, we proceeded to
screen the remaining compounds from the bioactive library using Calu-3 human pulmonary
epithelial cells only, which is more physiologically relevant to human infection. Selecting a hit
signal cutoff of >1.5 and >2.1 standard deviations from the library mean for the FDA approved
and bioactive library, respectively, our screens identified a total of 140 unconfirmed compounds
that significantly inhibit SARS-CoV-2-mediated CPE (Figure 2E and 2F). Best hits were
selected for dose response assays based both on these primary screen data and an
assessment of their suitability as potential COVID-19 therapeutics and prioritized for follow-up
validation experiments using an experimental pipeline designed to narrow down our list of
candidates to only the most promising compounds.

Leveraging the fact that compounds in the FDA-approved and bioactive libraries are well
characterized with many drug targets previously defined, we conducted a gene set enrichment
analysis (GSEA) of our candidate compounds to shed light on host-pathways important for
SARS-CoV-2 replication. We found significant enrichment of compounds targeting host cyclindependent kinases (CDK1, CDK2, and CDK9), GSK-3β, C-RAF, and JNK1-3, suggesting that
ubiquitous host pathways such as cell-cycle progression, MAPK-signaling, as well as GSK-3signaling are critical for SARS-CoV-2 infection. This agrees with a previously published analysis
based on phosphoproteomics of cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 (21) (Figure 2G). Thus, our
screen suggests these cellular pathways may contain druggable targets for inhibition SARSCoV-2 infection of human lung cells.

To validate the in vitro potency of drug candidates revealed in our screen, we determined the
half-maximal effective concentrations (EC50) of each compound by conducting dose response
curves in the cell line in which compounds were identified using our optimized CTG system as a
readout (Figure S2C). Confirmation rates in the secondary dose response screen were 72% for
the Calu-3 and 67% for the Vero-E6 screen, highlighting assay reproducibility and suitability for
hit identification (Figure 3, Figure S3). Our results identified 17 compounds with EC50 values
below 10 µM, including 6 below 5 µM, without significant cytotoxicity. Data for the most potent
compounds in Calu-3 cells are shown in Figure 3 and Figure S3. From this list of candidates,
the top 12 compounds were selected for down-stream validation (Figure 3). Hits were classified
into four distinct categories based upon their proposed mechanism of action, including (1)
protein kinase and protease inhibitors, (2) anti-inflammatory compounds, (3) direct-acting
antivirals, and (4) other host factor-targeting compounds. This set of hits contained compounds
with previously reported SARS-CoV-2 antiviral activity (dinaciclib, GC376 sodium, cyclosporin A,
and camostat mesylate) and seven compounds that have not previously been reported to have
anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity (Table 2) (21-24). These unreported compounds include the CDK
inhibitor AZD5438, the AKT inhibitor SC66, the VEGFR inhibitor BFH772, the NADPH oxidase
inhibitor GKT137831, the RAD51 inhibitor B02, the steroid budesonide, and the antiinflammatory compound cantharidin.

Confirmation and characterization of SARS-CoV-2 antiviral candidate compounds.
As our CPE-based screening assay measures SARS-CoV-2 induced cell death indirectly
through quantification of ATP from viable cells, this assay does not directly test for antiviral
activity of a given compound. To confirm the SARS-CoV-2 antiviral activity of our top 12
compound candidates, we tested their capacity to antagonize viral infection of Calu-3 cells
through TCID50 and qRT-PCR assays. Also included was the PIKfyve kinase inhibitor apilimod
mesylate, identified in Riva et al. 2020 (22). We found all tested candidates possessed

significant antiviral activity with viral titer reductions of infectious virus and genome equivalents
ranging from 1-4 logs compared to vehicle control treated cells (Figure 4A-H). Intriguingly, we
found that the CDK inhibitor dinaciclib (EC50 0.13 µM) was more potent in our assays than
remdesivir (EC50 2.45 µM) in limiting viral titers in Calu-3 cells as measured by TCID50 and
qRT-PCR (Table 2).

Since the antiviral activity of compounds in vitro may be cell-type specific, we tested the
capacity of a smaller subset of our candidates (dinaciclib, camostat mesylate, BFH772,
budesonide, GC376 sodium, apilimod mesylate, GKT137831, B02, and cyclosporin A) to
antagonize virus infection across multiple cell types. Compounds were selected based on their
lack of cytotoxicity across all cell lines (data not shown). We utilized an immunofluorescence
confocal microscopy assay (IFA) to measure the capacity of these 8 compounds to inhibit
SARS-CoV-2 replication in 3 diverse cell lines including Huh-7 (human hepatocytes), human
pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells stably expressing the SARS-CoV-2 receptor human
ACE2 (HPMEC/hACE2) (25), and Vero-E6 cells (Table 1). Cells are treated with compound
immediately prior to infection with SARS-CoV-2 and incubated for 24-48 hours. We then stained
for the SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein (N) and calculated antiviral activity as % decrease in cell
infection compared to vehicle treated infected cells. We found that the antiviral activity of GC376
sodium and apilimod mesylate were conserved across these cell lines (Figure 5A-B) while all
other tested drugs exhibited cell type specific activity (Figure 5C-I). GC376 sodium has been
suggested to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 M protease (Mpro) (26), which may explain its efficacy across
cell lines.

To shed light on mechanisms of action, we tested whether our top compounds inhibit SARSCoV-2 Mpro or papain-like protease (PLpro). Conducting in-house developed SARS-CoV-2
protease cleavage assays, we identified disulfiram as a potent PLpro inhibitor and both

disulfiram and GC376 sodium as Mpro inhibitors, confirming previous observations (26-28)
(Figure S4). Notably, high concentrations of disulfiram exhibited antiviral activity in Calu-3 cells
with 3 log reductions of viral titer and genome equivalents in TCID50 and qRT-PCR assays
compared to vehicle control treated cells, potentially explaining its antiviral mechanism of action
(Table 2). In summary, these data highlight the benefit of a target-agnostic approach to expose
previously unknown mechanisms of identified antivirals, as well as the importance of testing and
validation across multiple cell lines for anti-viral screening.

Candidate compound B02 exhibits antiviral synergy with the nucleoside analog
remdesivir.
Combination therapy is a highly desirable approach for treating SARS-CoV-2 infections (29).
Because our screen revealed only a single compound (dinaciclib) possessing greater antiviral
activity than remdesivir when used as a monotherapy, we asked if our compound candidates
possess synergistic antiviral activity when used in combination with remdesivir. To assess this,
we conducted a CPE inhibition assay using 10 µM of B02 in the presence or absence of an
EC15 of remdesivir (2 µM, Figure S2B-C) in Vero-E6 cells. Interestingly, the RAD51 inhibitor
B02 exhibited potent synergistic activity with remdesivir (Figure 6A). We confirmed these
results in Calu-3 cells by conducting a dose response of remdesivir in the presence or absence
of 10 µM B02 and observed a >10-fold shift in the EC50 of remdesivir. from 1 µM to <0.08 µM
(Figure 6B). Taken together, these observations suggest that in addition to providing new
starting points for therapeutic development, B02 may be pursued as a combination therapy with
remdesivir to develop treatments for COVID-19 patients.

Discussion
In this study, we screened a library of FDA-approved, clinical, and pre-clinical compounds for
antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, with the goal of rapidly repurposing drug candidates for

clinical use during the COVID-19 pandemic. We identified multiple cell lines that were
permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection and conducted primary screens using virus-induced CPE
as a functional readout in two highly permissive but divergent cell types (Vero-E6 and Calu-3).
We identified many compounds displaying varying degrees of antiviral activity across distinct
cell lines including Vero-E6, Calu-3, HPMEC/hACE2, and Huh-7. These cell-type dependent
phenotypes suggest significant cell type-dependency of compound efficacy in vitro. We further
validated a subset of candidates to define EC50 values, confirmed antiviral activity in orthogonal
assays, probed mechanism of action, and demonstrated antiviral synergy of one compound with
remdesivir. While our investigation successfully identified compounds published previously, we
also identified 7 potent compounds that to our knowledge have not been previously reported.
They include the RAD51 inhibitor B02, the CDK inhibitor AZD5438, the AKT inhibitor SC66, the
VEGFR inhibitor BFH772, the NADPH oxidase inhibitor GKT137831, the steroid budesonide,
and the anti-inflammatory compound cantharidin. Further, B02 was found to synergize with
remdesivir, shifting the apparent EC50 of remdesivir more than 10-fold. Together, our results
present new possibilities for FDA-approved and other well-validated candidate drugs to be
repurposed for remdesivir combination therapy.

The cell-type dependent antiviral efficacy of many of our drug candidates within this screen
indicates a strong selection bias is introduced by the selection of cell type used in the screen.
The biological reason for this is likely due to distinct cell-type expression patterns of host-factors
essential for SARS-CoV-2 replication or differential drug metabolism. For example, SARS-CoV2 requires proteolytic cleavage of the Spike (S) glycoprotein by a host protease once it binds to
the ACE2 receptor (30-32). This cleavage can be performed by multiple host proteases
including TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L, whose expression levels vary significantly between
different cell lines (30, 33, 34). Vero-E6 cells do not express TMPRSS2, meaning any drug
targeting TMPRSS2, or the interaction between S and TMPRSS2, would not emerge as a hit in

such a cell line (32). Indeed the drug candidate camostat mesylate, a TMRPSS2 inhibitor
currently in clinical trials (35) inhibited SARS-CoV-2 in Calu-3 but not Vero-E6 cells (Figure 5).
Conversely, GC376 sodium, a previously characterized SARS-CoV-2 protease inhibitor,
maintains its antiviral activity across multiple cell lines in our study, suggesting that compounds
targeting viral factors may be expected to show activity across different tissues, although the
extent of activity can differ based on prodrug metabolism, as previously observed with
remdesivir (26, 27, 36). Pharmacokinetics and dynamics must be taken into account for each
compound and may be influenced by the metabolic state of distinct cell lines or tissue within
infected humans. Our comparative cell line investigation of antiviral compounds highlights cell
line selection as a critical step when conducting SARS-CoV-2 drug screens and may explain
disparate data obtained in different studies (21-23, 37-42).

Defining the mechanisms of action of antiviral compounds is critical to determine how a
compound may be modified to improve antiviral efficacy and to suggest the compounds’
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic limitations. An advantage of screening libraries of well
characterized compounds is that the molecular targets of many compounds are already
determined. GSEA analysis of our top antiviral candidates revealed a set of enriched host and
viral targets. Our candidate compounds possess distinct mechanisms of action including host
kinase and protease inhibition, anti-inflammatory activity, and direct antiviral efficacy targeting
virus factors. Our results also implicate host-pathways that are critical for SARS-CoV-2 viral
replication including regulation of the cell cycle through modulating CDKs, regulating MAPK
signaling through modulation of c-JUN N-terminal kinases (JNK), and modulation of glycogen
synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3). Our screening results are consistent with other reports that these
diverse cellular pathways are likely to be critical for the SARS-CoV-2 lifecycle (21, 43-46).
These observations call for further mechanistic investigation of the dependency of SARS-CoV-2

on these various host pathways and highlight the potential of repurposing other drugs not
studied here that target these pathways.

Though our study identified many distinct antiviral candidates, only dinaciclib exceeded the in
vitro potency of remdesivir, suggesting that few, if any, “magic bullet” compounds exist in the
library of FDA-approved and clinical/preclinical compounds. This is not unexpected for a
repurposing approach, and therefore, combination therapy may be the best strategy to achieve
high efficacy rapidly (29). Here, we identify the RAD51 inhibitor B02 as highly synergistic with
remdesivir in both Vero-E6 and Calu-3 cells. The mechanism of action of this antiviral synergy is
currently unclear and an active area of investigation. As RAD51 is known to play a role in DNA
repair and strand exchange via interactions with CDK1 during the cell cycle, its mechanism of
action may be connected to the dependency of SARS-CoV-2 on cell-cycle arrest during
infection and repurposing of host machinery for viral replication (21, 47-50). Because remdesivir
functions as a nucleoside analog that inhibits the function of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent
RNA Polymerase (RdRP) during replication (51, 52), the antiviral activity of remdesivir may be
enhanced when the virus is unable to modulate the cell cycle in such a way that promotes
optimal viral RNA replication (50). Alternatively, RAD51 may directly promote SARS-CoV-2
replication as a component of the viral replication complex, as it is also reported to localize to
the membranous replication complex of hepatitis c virus (HCV) where it interacts with the HCV
nonstructural protein 3 (53). RAD51 may function comparably for SARS-CoV-2 and thus B02
may interfere with SARS-CoV-2 replication machinery in a manner that enhances the activity of
remdesivir. This is further supported by the observation that B02 possesses antiviral activity in
the absence of remdesivir suggesting either that RAD51 plays a direct role in promoting viral
replication or that B02 has activity against other targets. We have previously observed antiviral
synergy against SARS-CoV-2 for compounds that possess no antiviral activity on their own
against SARS-CoV-2, such as the HCV NS5A inhibitor velpatasvir (29). This suggests antiviral
12

synergy may arise through direct inhibition of one or more viral factors as well as through
modulation of host pathways. Further, as remdesivir is a direct inhibitor of the RdRP, the virus
can be thought of as in a “weakened” or “sensitized” state in the presence of remdesivir,
potentially making it more vulnerable to additional chemical compounds with no appreciable
activity on their own. Taken together, the potential of combinatorial approaches, ideally against
distinct molecular targets, holds promise and should be prioritized for in vivo studies to
determine efficacy.

At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, many groups utilized a variety of genetic,
proteomic, and chemical screening strategies to identify potential drugs for repurposing against
SARS-CoV-2. These studies differ in the cell type selected for screening and in the assays used
to determine viral replication. Most SARS-CoV-2 drug screens to date have utilized either an
IFA-based approach or a CPE-based approach. In general, the IFA-based screens investigate
antiviral activity earlier than CPE-based studies (typically 1-2 dpi vs. 3-4 dpi respectively) adding
a selection bias for compounds that are effective at early time-points, as many compounds with
mild antiviral activity (or shorter half-lives) may be overcome by viral replication at later time
points. In addition to the need to interpret in vitro assay data carefully, our study highlights the
importance of cell type selection when screening for antiviral compounds in vitro. Use of multiple
cell lines is critical. In particular, many early studies used Vero cells due to their widespread
availability, permissiveness to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and ease of use and manipulation.
However, we found that activity of compounds against SARS-CoV-2 in Vero cells does not
correlate well with activity in Calu-3 cells, an arguably more relevant human epithelial cell line.
Thus, when interpreting in vitro antiviral candidates, both cell type, readout, and relative timing
of drug and virus addition need to be carefully considered.

Although several COVID-19 vaccines have received Emergency Use Authorization recently by
the FDA, pharmaceutical therapies for COVID-19 patients will continue to be urgently needed.
Vaccines will not be widely available for several months, however more importantly, even an
optimal vaccine will not eliminate severe COVID-19 due to limitations of vaccine use and
efficacy in specific populations such as immunocompromised and pediatric patients. Our study
identified 7 compounds not previously demonstrated to have antiviral activity with potential for
COVID-19 therapy, one of them strongly synergistic with the approved COVID-19 therapeutic
remdesivir. Intriguingly, budesonide is already studied in clinical trials for COVID-19 treatment
because of its anti-inflammatory properties, and if positive, antiviral efficacy should be
considered as an additional pharmacodynamic effect. Investigation into the mechanism of action
and in vivo efficacy of these compounds is of paramount importance, as is defining the safety
profiles of these compounds alone and in combination with remdesivir in humans. Such studies
are currently underway in our lab as well as in other labs, but further collaboration is needed to
expedite this process and provide access to pre-clinical and clinical testing to alleviate the

Methods
Cells lines
Multiple cell lines were acquired in this study to determine permissiveness to SARS-CoV-2 for
use in drug screens. Vero-E6 cells were acquired from the American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC) and maintained in DMEM media supplemented high glucose DMEM (Gibco, Waltham,
MA) supplemented with 10% FBS (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), 1X GlutaMAX (Gibco), and
1X PenStrep (Gibco) [D10 media]. Huh-7 and HPMEC cells were obtained from Dr. Eva Harris
(UC Berkeley) and maintained in D10 media or endothelial growth medium 2 (EGM-2) using the
EGM-2 bullet kit from Lonza, respectively. LNCaP, HaCaT, Caco-2, Calu-3, HCT-116, and A549
cells were obtained from the UC Berkeley Cell Culture Facility and maintained in D10 media.
NCI-H1437 and RD cells were obtained from the Cell and Genome Engineering Core at UCSF
via Dr. Olga Gulyaeva (UCSF) and Dr. Michael T. McManus (UCSF) and maintained in D10
media. HBEC-30KT and BEAS-2B cells were obtained from Dr. Neil Tay (UCSF) and Dr.
Michael T. McManus (UCSF) via Dr. Patrick Mitchell (UC Berkeley) and Dr. Russell Vance (UC
Berkeley) and maintained in defined keratinocyte serum free medium (catalog #10744019,
ThermoFisher Scientific) and Advanced RPMI containing 5% FBS, 1% L-glutamine,
1X PenStrep, respectively. Huh-7.5.1 cells were obtained from Dr. Andreas Puschnik (Chan
Zuckerberg Biohub) and maintained in D10 media. All cells were maintained in a C02 incubator
at 37˚ C with 5% CO2. HPMEC/hACE2 and A549/hACE2 cell lines were produced by
transducing parental cells with lentivirus encoding the human ACE2 gene followed by puromycin
selection (2 µg/ml) for three passages. The hACE2 encoding plasmid was a gift from Hyeryun
Choe (Addgene plasmid # 1786; htt://n2t.net/addgene:1786; RRID:Addgene_1786) (54).

The USA-WA1/2020 strain of SARS-CoV-2 was obtained from BEI Resources. The initial stock
from BEI was passed through a 0.45 µM syringe filter and 5 µl of this filtered stock was
inoculated onto ~80% confluent T175 flasks (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) of Vero-E6 cells to
produce passage 1 of the virus. CPE was monitored daily and flasks were frozen down when
cells exhibited 50-70% cytopathic effect (CPE) (48-72 hpi). Thawed lysates were then collected
and cell debris was pelleted at 3000 x rpm for 20 minutes. Clarified viral supernatant was then
aliquoted and infectious virus was quantified via a TCID50 assay. To produce passage 2 SARSCoV-2 working stocks, 5 µl of the passage 1 stock was inoculated onto ~80% confluent T175
flasks of Vero-E6 cells as described above. Viral titers produced in Vero-E6 cells ranged from
1x106-5x106 TCID50 units / mL.

Compound preparation, drug screening, and synergy experiments
The compound screening and 384-well infection experiments were conducted as described
previously (29) and are described below. The FDA-approved drug library (Targetmol) and the
Bioactives Library (Targetmol, Wellesley Hills, MA) containing 1,200 compounds and 4,170
compounds, respectively, were stored in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at 10 mM in 384-well master
plates. Remdesivir (T7766, Targetmol) was also stored at 10 mM in DMSO. For drug screening,
2.5x103 Vero-E6 cells (12 µl/well) or 1x104 Calu-3 (12 µl/well) were seeded in 384-well white
optical-bottom tissue culture-treated plates (Nunc) with a Multidrop Combi liquid handling
instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Cells were incubated for 24 (Vero-E6) or 48
hours (Calu-3) at 37°C and 5% CO2 before experiments were conducted. For the primary screen,
dose response experiments, and synergy experiments, compounds were prediluted to 4x final
concentration (8x for synergy experiments) in high glucose DMEM. 6 µl and 3 µl of media (for
primary and synergy experiments, respectively) was transferred from compound dilution plates to
cells in 384-well plates using a Cybio Well vario liquid handler (Analytik Jena, Jena, Germany),
leading to a final concentration of DMSO at 0.4% (v/v) in the assay plate. Primary screens were

conducted at 40 µM compound. For the dose response experiments, 10-point dose responses
were generated by conducting 2-fold dilutions starting at 40 µM for compound confirmation and
10 uM for remdesivir in synergy plates. For all experiments conducted above, cells were incubated
with compounds at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 1 hour before infection.
For all experiments above, cells were infected in 384-well plates at a multiplicity of infection (MOI)
of 0.05 in a total volume of 6 µl/well. Cells were harvested for CTG-analysis once complete CPE
was observed in DMSO-treated infected wells (72 hpi for Vero-E6 and 96 hpi for Calu-3). For
harvest, opaque stickers (Nunc) were applied to the bottoms of plates to minimize signal spillover
between wells, and plates were developed with the CellTiter-Glo 2.0 reagent (Promega, Madison,
WI) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, with the exception of Vero-E6 cells, for which
CTG reagent was diluted 1:1 (v/v) in PBS (Gibco, Waltham, MA, USA). Luminescence was read
on a Spectramax L (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA). Each plate contained 24 wells of
uninfected/DMSO treated cells (100% CPE inhibition), and 24 wells infected/DMSO treated cells
(0% CPE inhibition). Average values from those wells were used for data normalization and to
determine % CPE inhibition for test compound wells. Duplicate plates were used to calculate
average values and standard deviations. Z’ was determined as described previously (55).
Statistical significance between experimental conditions were assessed using a two-tailed,
heteroscedastic student’s t-test. Measurements were taken from distinct samples unless
indicated otherwise. The data was plotted and analyzed with Spotfire (Tibco) and GraphPad Prism
(San Diego, CA).

GSEA Analysis
The methods for GSEA analysis conducted for this study were previously reported and
described below (29). In brief, candidate compounds identified in our screens were assigned
distinct properties based on known host targets and pathways using the Center for Emerging
and Neglected Diseases’ database and for pharmacokinetic data and transporter inhibition data,

the DrugBank database. Each assigned property was tested for enrichment among the
screening hits using the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) software as described (22, 56,
57). Compounds annotated for each property were considered as part of the “gene set”. For
each set of annotations, the background compound set was defined as the set of compounds
annotated for any property. GSEA preranked analysis was performed using the compounds’ %
CPE inhibition from each screen. Compound sets included in the analysis were between 5 and
500 compounds. The enrichment score (ES) reflects the degree to which a gene set is
overrepresented at the top of a ranked list of compounds interacting with the given target. GSEA
calculates the ES by walking down the ranked list of compounds interacting with the given
target, increasing a running-sum statistic when a gene is in the gene set and decreasing it when
it is not.

Immunofluorescence microscopy analysis (IFA)
1x104 Vero-E6, HPMEC/hACE2, or Huh-7 cells were seeded in black 96-well plates with clear
bottoms 24 hours before adding drug combinations and infecting with SARS-CoV-2 at MOI 0.05
(viral inoculums were not washed away). Plates were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) 24 hpi
(Vero-E6 and HPMEC/hACE2) and 48 hpi (Huh-7), permeabilized using 0.2% saponin in blocking
buffer (2% BSA, 1% FBS in PBS) at room temperature for 30 minutes, incubated with mouse antiSARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (1:1000, Sino Biological, Beijing, China; 40145-MM05)
overnight in blocking buffer, incubated with goat anti-mouse AlexaFluor647 (1:1000, Abcam,
Cambridge, United Kingdom) and DAPI/Hoechst (1:1000, Invitrogen) in blocking buffer, fixed in
4% PFA, and kept in 1x PBS until imaging on an Image Xpress Micro 4 (Molecular Devices). An
average of 1x103 cells were imaged across four sites per well and were analyzed for nucleocapsid
(N) stain per nuclei (DAPI) using CellProfiler 3.1.9 (Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA).

TCID50 assay

5x104 Calu-3 cells were seeded into 96-well plates 48 hours before adding drug combinations
and viral inoculum (MOI 0.05) (viral inoculum was not washed away). At 24 hpi supernatant was
collected from each well and serially diluted, and each dilution was applied to eight wells in 96well plates containing Vero-E6 cells. Three days later, CPE was counted visually and
TCID50/mL was calculated using the dilution factor required to produce CPE in half, or 4/8, of
the wells for a given dilution.

RT-qPCR
RT-qPCR was conducted as previously reported (29), and further described below. For RT-qPCR,
supernatants were collected at 48hpi and inactivated 1:1 in 1X DNA/RNA Shield for RNA
extraction and RT-qPCR analysis (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA). RNA was extracted using
the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. In brief, 140 µL of each sample was mixed with 560 µL of Carrier-RNA-containing
AVL and incubated for 10 min at RT. After addition of 560 µL of 100% ethanol, the samples were
spun through columns. The columns were washed sequentially with 500 µL of AW1 and 500 µL

using the second derivative peak method (58). Custom code written in MATLAB (available
at https://gitlab.com/tjian-darzacq-lab/second-derivative-cq-analysis) was used to take the
numerical second derivative of fluorescence intensity with respect to cycle number, using a sliding
window of ± 3 cycles. The peak of the second derivative was fit to a parabola, whose center was
taken to be the Cq value (58).

SARS-CoV-2 MPro Activity Assay
Compounds were dissolved in DMSO at 50X the desired screening concentration. DMSO was
used as a solvent control. MPro protein (purification described below) was diluted in assay
buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0,01% pluronic acid F127) to a
concentration of 30 nM and 24.5 µL of diluted protein was aliquoted to each well of a black 384
well plate (Corning 384-Well, Flat-Bottom Microplate). Each well was treated with 0.5 µL of
compound or vehicle and the plate was incubated for 30 min at room temperature. During the
compound incubation the peptide probe KTSAVLQ-Rh110-gammaGlu (Biosyntan) was diluted
from 5 mM DMSO stock into assay buffer. After pre-incubation, 5 µL of 75 µM Rh-110 probe
was added to each well. RFU value was immediately measured on a Tecan Spark plate reader
with an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and an emission wavelength of 535 nm at 30 °C for 30
min.

Purification of SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease
The coding sequence for SARS-CoV-2 main protease was codon-optimized for E. coli and
synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies. The sequence was amplified by PCR and cloned
into the pGEX6P-1 vector, downstream of GST and an HRV 3C protease cleavage site, using
the Gibson Assembly Master Mix kit (New England BioLabs, Inc). To ensure authentic termini,
the amino acids AVLQ were added to the N-terminus of the main protease by addition of their
coding sequence to the 5′ end of the gene product. This sequence reconstitutes the SARS-CoV20

2 NSP4/5 cleavage site, resulting in auto-cleavage by the main protease protein product (59).
Similarly, we added a GP-6xHis tag for IMAC purification to the C-terminus (the GP completes a
non-consensus 3C cleavage site along with the C-terminus of the main protease which allows
for cleavage of the his tag after purification, resulting in an authentic C-terminus).
Hi Control BL21(DE3) cells were transformed with the expression plasmid using standard
techniques. We used Hi Control cells as we observed expression of the main protease was toxic
in other standard E. coli cell lines. A single colony was used to start an overnight culture in LB +
carbenicillin media. This culture was used to inoculate 2 x 1 L cultures in Terrific Broth,
supplemented with 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.0 and 100 µg/mL carbenicillin. These
cultures grew in Fernbach flasks at 37 °C while shaking at 225 rpm, until the OD600 reached
approximately 2.0, at which point the temperature was reduced to 20 °C and 0.5 mM IPTG
(final) was added to each culture. The cells were allowed to grow overnight.
The next day, the cultures were centrifuged at 6,000 x g for 20 minutes at 4 °C, and the
resulting cell pellets were resuspended in IMAC_A buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 400 mM NaCl, 1
mM TCEP). Cells were lysed with two passes through a cell homogenizer (Microfluidics model
M-110P) at 18,000 psi. The lysate was clarified with centrifugation at 42,000 x g for 30 minutes
and the cleared lysate was loaded onto 3 x 5 mL HiTrap Ni-NTA columns (GE) pre-equilibrated
with IMAC_A buffer, using an AKTA Pure FPLC. After loading, the columns were washed with
IMAC_A buffer until the A280 levels reached a sustained baseline. The protein was then eluted
with a linear gradient with IMAC_B buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 400 mM NaCl, 500 mM
imidazole, 1 mM TCEP) across 25 column volumes, while 2 mL fractions were collected
automatically. Peak fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and those containing SARS-CoV-2
main protease were pooled. Importantly, auto-cleavage of the N-terminal GST tag was observed
and the eluted protein had a mass consistent with SARS-CoV-2 main protease along with the Cterminal GP-6xHis tag, as determined by ESI-LC/MS.

Pooled fractions were treated with HRV 3C protease (also known as “PreScission” protease)
while dialyzing against IMAC_A buffer at room temperature (2 x 2 L dialyses). Room
temperature dialysis was important as we observed a tendency for the main protease protein to
precipitate with prolonged exposure to 4 °C. Cleavage of the C-terminal GP-6xHis tag was
confirmed after 2 hours by ESI-LC/MS. The dialyzed and cleaved protein was then re-run
through a 5 mL HiTrap Ni-NTA column pre-equilibrated with IMAC_A buffer. The main protease
eluted in the flow-through as expected.
The protein was then concentrated to approximately 5 mL and loaded onto a Superdex 75 16/60
column pre-equilibrated with SEC Buffer (25 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM
TCEP). The protein was run through the column at 1 mL/min and eluted as one large peak well
in the included volume (at ~75 mL). Fractions from this peak were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and
pure fractions were pooled and concentrated to 10 mg/mL, aliquoted, and stored at -80 °C. Final
yield was typically in the realm of 60-70 mg/L of culture.

SARS-CoV-2 PLpro Activity Assay
Compounds were dissolved in DMSO at 50X the desired screening concentration. DMSO was
used as a solvent control. PLpro protein was purified as described below. The screening assay
was performed in black 384 well plates (Corning 384-Well, Flat-Bottom Microplate), and was
performed in a 25.5 µL volume which contained a final PLpro concentration of 50 nM, a 50 µM
concentration of substrate (RLRGG-AMC), and 0.5µl of DMSO or compound (final concentration
of 40µM), the final assay buffer contained 20mM Hepes pH 7.5, 100mM NaCl and 0.1% mg/ml
BSA. Screens were performed with 1:5000 antifoam to reduce the surface tension and bubbles.
After addition of the substrate, the RFU value was measured on a Tecan Spark plate reader with
an excitation wavelength of 360 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm at 30 °C for 30 min.

The papain-like protease (PLpro) expressing plasmid, 2BT-Nsp3-PLpro was transformed into E.
coli BL21 (DE3) and plated on ampicillin resistant LB agar plate. The next day, a colony was
picked up for overnight culture in the presence of ampicillin 100µg/ml. For large-scale protein
purification, a 1L culture of 2XYT media was grown using overnight culture (1:100) at 37°C (210
rpm). The bacterial culture was grown to an OD600 ~0.8-1.0 and induced with 1mM IPTG. The
protein was expressed at 20°C for overnight (18-20 hours). The bacterial culture was harvested
at 4000 X g and cell pellets were resuspended in 30 mL lysis buffer (25mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0,
250mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5mM β-mercaptoethanol), supplemented with protease inhibitor
tablets. The cell culture was sonicated at 20% amplitude for 7 minutes (0.5 sec ON, 1.5 sec OFF).
Cellular debris was pelleted down by centrifuging at 15,000 X g for 20 minutes at 4°C. The
supernatant was loaded on a Talon column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) (pre-equilibrated with
lysis buffer) at a speed of 1 mL/min. Non-specific proteins were washed with 20 column volumes
of Buffer-A (lysis buffer supplemented with 25 mM imidazole). PLpro protein was eluted with 5
column volumes of Buffer-B (lysis buffer supplemented with 250 mM imidazole). The eluted
protein was concentrated using a 10 kDa MWCO filter (Amicon-Millipore), and concentrated up
to 2 mg/mL.
