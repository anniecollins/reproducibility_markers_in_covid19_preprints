Abstract:

Coronaviruses (CoVs) are one of the largest groups of positive-sense RNA virus families
within the Nidovirales order, which are further classified into four genera: alpha, beta,
gamma, and delta. Coronaviruses have an extensive range of natural hosts and are known to
be responsible for a broad spectrum of diseases in multiple species. Severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the ongoing
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that has unleashed a global threat to public health and
the economy. Coronaviruses are extensively present in birds and mammals, with horseshoe
bats

(Rhinolophus affinis ),

being the reservoir for the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 that seems to

have resulted from a zoonotic spillover to the human host, causing respiratory infections,
lung injury and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome(ARDS).

About six coronavirus

serotypes are linked with the disease in humans, namely HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoVOC43, HCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV. SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh CoV
to infect humans. We analyzed the genome sequence of CoV-2 from isolates derived from
China as well from India and encountered minute variations in their sequence. A cladogram
analysis revealed the predominant strain circulating in India belongs to the A2a clad. We
took one such strain (MT012098) and performed a rigorous in-silico genotypic and antigenic
analysis to identify its relatedness to other strains. Further, we also performed a detailed
prediction for B and T cell epitopes using BepiPred 2.0 server and NetCTL 1.2 server (DTU
Bioinformatics), respectively. We hope this information may assist in an effective vaccine
designing program against SARS-CoV-2.

Introduction:

The global outbreak of Beta (β)corona virus- is not so rare as we witnessed SARS-CoV, a
member of the beta coranviradea in 2002-2003, and MERS-CoV in 2016-2018. What is,
however, alarming is that the outbreak from this family of virus results in significant
mortality worldwide. The striking difference between these three members, SARS-CoV-2
and SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV-2, is their contagious nature, with SAS-CoV-2 demonstrating
significantly high contagiousness compared to the rest of the family members, that resulted
in the global pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV-2 are both closely related to SARS-CoV2, possibly originating from horseshoe bat reservoirs. The biological differences between
these viruses are striking, with a strong genomic heterogeneity even with a high sequence
homology as observed between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2. These sequence
homogeneities are critical for their specific identification in diagnostics. The PCR-based
methods play a vital role in the detection of viral infection during the early phase for clinical
management by using SARS-CoV based primers. The SARS-CoV-2 virus was first sequenced
by Wu et al. in Shanghai, China (Wu et al, 2020). Information derived from whole-genome
sequencing as well as from partial sequences of CoV-2revealed the Genome to be29,811
nucleotides long, broken down as follows: 8,903 (29.86%) adenosines, 5,482 (18.39%)
cytosines, 5,852 (19.63%) guanines, and 9,574 (32.12%) thymines that makes up the genes
for the Spike (S), Nucleocapsid (N), Envelope (E) and ORF genes. The whole-genome data
reveals >70% sequence homology between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS CoV and >40% sequence
homology with MERS. We annotated a total of 250 genome sequences available in public
databases, which includes about 90 whole-genome sequences (Hatcher et al.). This has led
us to identify about 900 variant sites for the SARS-CoV-2. Genome sequencing of the SARSCoV-2 has been done across the world. From India, two complete genome sequences
deposited at NCBI with GenBank ID (MT012098, MT050493) were taken for analysis. We
took MT12098 as the Genome for analyzing the antigenicity. Also, the reference genome
having NCBI ID, NC_045512, was chosen as reference. The Structural proteins Spike
protein(S), Nucleocapsid protein (N), Membrane Protein (M), and Envelope protein of
Genome MT12098 were taken for analysis of Antigenic epitope analysis. The protein
sequences between MT12098 and the Reference genome were 100% conserved. However,
some variations were observed between the S protein of Reference genome and MT12098 ,

which were otherwise 99.84% conserved. The SARS-CoV-2 Genome consists of ORF1a,
ORF1b, S protein-coding region, Orf3a, E protein-coding region, M protein-coding region,
ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8, N protein-coding region, and Orf10. The widely known
structural proteins are Spike protein(S), Nucleocapsid protein (N), Membrane Protein (M),
and Envelope protein (E).
SARS CoV-2 virus phylogeneticity:

Since the wide-spread effect of COVID-19 has occurred, a large number of labs have been
sequencing SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Currently, more than 4000 sequenced genomes have
been submitted from various parts of the world in the Global Initiative on Sharing Influenza
Data (GISAID) repository (Shu et al 2017). We observed that a large number of the
submitted genomes are identical, with little to no change as compared to the reference
genome. We also observed some common variations in the genomes of the SARS-CoV-2.
These commonly occurring variations helped scientists to classify the viral Genome. Forster
et al, devised a method to classify SARS-CoV-2 based on the changes in amino acids that
each of the mutations caused. The proteomes of the S clade show a Serine in the 84th
position of the ORF8 protein, differing from the Leucine in the reference protein. This
mutation is represented as L84S, the S in the name of the clade represents the amino acid
Serine. The G clade has a variation in the spike-glycoprotein, where the D at 614 of the
reference protein is replaced with Glycine (G) and the mutation is named D614G. The V
clade is when the Glycine of the reference protein is changed to a Valine at the 251st
position, ie, a G251V. This is in the NSP3 protein region (Forster et al. 2020).A large number
of genomes that are submitted to GISAID are unclassified into these clades, thereby
ascertaining that these clades are not extensive. According to the Nextstrain website, L84S
is present in 35% genomes, the D614G mutation in 61% and G251V in 20% of genomes
(Hadfield et al. 2018).
Classification into clades based on nucleotide similarity:

Another way to classify the virus is by using genomic information only(Fig 1). Based on this,
the SARS-CoV-2 can be classified as O,A1, A1a, A2, A2a, A3, A5, B1, B2 and B4 clades. The
Nextstrain website uses this classification method to draw cladograms on their website (Shu
et al. 2017).The A2a type possesses a non-synonymous variant (D614G) that eases the entry

of the virus into the lung cell of the host. According to the recent paper by Biswas et al, this
could be the reason behind the A2a type enjoying a major advantage to infect and survive
(Biswas et al. 2020).

Figure (1A) showing the clade distribution of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequenced
globally. Most genomes lie in the A2a clade. Figure (1B) shows the clade distribution of
Indian genomes.
Indian genomes show a different perspective:

So far a number of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from India have been submitted in the GISAID and
NCBI websites. As seen in figure (B),the new genome strains that were published revealed
that the predominant Indian strain belong to the A2a clade(60%). The remaining, close to
40% belong to the O clade (Close to the first published Genome from China)
Phylogenetic analysis of the Indian genomes:

On constructing a cladogram using NCBI's inbuilt phylogenetic tree program, it is observed
that there are wide variations in the genomes that have been submitted from India (Fig.2).

Figure2: Cladogram depicting Indian genomes available on NCBI. The cladogram was
constructed using distance to denote genetic mutations.

For this present study, to compare all the genomes sequenced from India, we used
MT012098 as the reference genome, since this was the first whole-genome sequence that
was publicly available from India. Further to note that MT012098 shows similarity to the

original SARS-CoV-2 Genome published from China with a few mutations as depicted below.
This Genome is categorized into the original (O) clade.

Figure 3: A graphical representation showing the variations of the SARS-CoV-2 Genome (in
blue from an isolate in China ) with MT012098 (in orange from an isolate in India) Red
lines depict the variations in the Genome from the Indian isolate.

As compared to the SARS-CoV-2 from China, the Indian isolate MT012098, showed no
sequence difference among the structural proteins (S,E,M and N protein). However we
observe changes in the S region where there is a gap at 145 and an R407I mutation (Fig.3).
Antigenicity of SARS-CoV-2 and possible vaccine target for SARS-CoV-2

Antigenicity can be viewed as the potential of a defined chemical structure to interact and
bind to immune cell surface receptors (T cell receptors or B cell receptors (Antibodies) such
as. Antigens may be, therefore be capable of eliciting an immune response due to their
interaction with the immune cells. The antigens have a fundamental unit called epitopes
(antigens are made of multiple epitopes) to which the Antibodies or T cell receptors can
bind. Therefore, we can classify the epitopes into two broad categories, B cell epitopes and
T cell epitopes. The antigenicity and immunogenicity (capacity to elicit an immune response)
are therefore based on their B cell and T cell epitopes. For B cells, the epitopes could be
further subdivided into (1) linear and (2) discontinuous epitopes wherein linear epitope is a
continuous stretch of peptides, whereas discontinuous epitopes are distant amino acids
coming near each other in space due to protein folding. Taken together, both these epitopes
contribute to the overall B cell-related antigenicity/immunogenicity. The T cell epitopes are
peptides or 9 to 11 or 13 to 18 amino acids, which require a special molecule called Major
histocompatibility complex to bind to them and be presented on the cell surface through a
classical antigen receptor cells (APC). The T- cell receptor then recognizes both MHC and the
peptide presented for binding and eliciting the immune response. The peptide is presented
by broadly two kinds of MHC molecules. MHC class I and MHC class II. Wherein, peptide

The cytotoxic T lymphocytes are responsible for the execution of apoptotic cell death of the
infected cell through the release of cytotoxic molecules like cytokines and interferons On
the other hand; the CD4+ T cell is majorly responsible for assisting the humoral immunity
(Inducing the B cell response).

Figure 4: Summary of the workflow for antigenic peptide prediction
B cell Epitope prediction: For B cell linear epitopes Bepipred version 2 algorithm was used.

The software utilizes the random forest algorithm, which is trained on epitopes annotated
from the antibody-antigen protein structure (Jespersen et al., 2017). The Bepipred version 2
is available in Immune Epitope Data Base Analysis resources (http://tools.iedb.org/bcell/).
Further, ElliPro (http://tools.iedb.org/ellipro/) was used for the analysis of both linear and
discontinuous analysis(Ponomarenko et al., 2008). ElliPro (Ellipsoid and Protrusion), is a webtool that implements a modified version of Thornton's method(Thorton et al. 1986).

(http://www.ddg-

pharmfac.net/vaxijen/VaxiJen/VaxiJen.html ) was used for measuring antigenicity and for
alignment independent prediction of protective antigens . It uses alignment-free prediction
based on the physicochemical properties. It utilizes autocross covariance(ACC) for its
algorithm. The algorithm is trained on 100 antigens and 100 non-antigens of bacterial viral
and tumor proteins(Doytchinova and Flower, 2007).
Conservancy analysis: Conservancy analysis for the peptide was performed using IEDB

epitope conservancy analysis tool http://tools.iedb.org/conservancy/(Bui et al., 2007).
Results:
Blast:

Blast P for S,N M, and E protein were performed between the reference Genome and
NC_045512 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1,
complete Genome)and the Indian isolate MT012098. For N, M, and E protein, 100% identity
was observed while for S protein, 99.84% identity was with the variations above mentioned.
Due to these variations, S protein of the reference strain was separately used for analyzing
the antigenic peptides for B cell and T cell epitopes. Similarly, S, M, N, and E protein of the
Indian strain were also utilized for B and T cell peptide analysis.

Prediction of B Cell Epitopes:

For analyzing the linear epitopes, IEDB BepiPred linear epitope prediction tool was used
(http://tools.iedb.org/bcell/)(Jespersen et al., 2017). The threshold cut off was taken as 0.5,
which is also the default cut-off. A total of 33 B cell epitope peptides were given as output
for reference MT012098 S protein, while11,6, and 2 for N, M, and E protein were observed,
respectively (Table 1a, 1b, 1c, 1d). The variation in B cell linear epitope antigenic peptides of
S protein reference strain compared to the Indian strain is shown (Fig 5A-5C).

For discontinuous epitopes, the IEDB Ellipro algorithm was used with the threshold cut-off
based on the protrusion index (P.I.) score is 0.5 (Ponomarenko et al., 2008). However, we
had taken the cut-off of 0.7 as a greater score means greater solvent accessibility(Adhikari
et al., 2018; Ponomarenko et al., 2008). The maximum distance between the amino acids in
space was taken as 6 angstrom, which is the default cut-off. The S protein and N protein
alpha chain of only the reference genome was analyzed as the Protein Data Base (PDB) I.D.,
and the structure of the protein in PDB is required for the algorithms analyzing
discontinuous B cell epitopes. Minimal variation was observed for the P.I. score above 0.7.
The maximum was 0.744 and minimum of 0.735 (Fig 5 A-D). Four different epitopes with P.I.
score of more than 0.7 was observed. For the N protein alpha chain, only one epitope was
observed, having a score greater than 0.7.

T cell epitope prediction:

For analyzing MHC, class I represented T cell epitopes, NetCTL version 1.2 was used. The
advantage of this algorithm, in addition to utilizing the process required for MHC class I
representation of T cell peptides, is that it has a pool of MHC haplotypes grouped into MHC
supertypes(Dos Santos Francisco et al., 2015; Sidney et al., 2008; Zhao et al., 2017). NetCTL
1.2 has haplotype grouped into12 MHC supertypes, which are HLA A1, A2, A3, A24, A26, B7,
B8, B27, B39, B44, B58, and B62. Among these, the more common HLA A1, A2, A3, A24, B27,
B44, and B62 were chosen. The default cut-off of 0.75 for the combined score was
determined. The higher score has improved specificity but reduced sensitivity while the
lower score has more sensitivity but with reduced specificity. For MT012098, S protein, a
total of 314 potential MHC Class I associated T-cell peptides were obtained for all the 8 MHC
supertypes(data not shown). Similarly, 75,184 and 34 peptides were obtained for N, M, and
E proteins of MT012098, respectively. Each of these peptides was further subjected to
antigenicity analysis using the VaxiJen server 2.0. The default cut-off score for potential
antigens is 0.4; however, due to a large number of hits, we increased the threshold to 0.7. A
super peptide, which was having a score greater than 0.7 were only considered. These
peptides had a high probability of associating with the surface MHC class I molecules and
have high probable antigenicity and therefore has a strong vaccine potential. The peptides
for S protein having a cut-off score over 0.7 have been depicted in Figures 5A and 5B. A total

E 26, 40, and 14 supertypes for all the above-aforementioned supertypes were obtained for
MT012098 (Table 2C,2D, 2E).
Only three potential T cell peptides derived from S protein of the reference genome were
different form the S protein of MT012098. These peptides of the S protein of the reference

For analyzingMHC, class, I represented T cell epitopes, NetCTL version 1.2 was used. The
advantage of this algorithm, in addition to utilizing the process required for MHC class I
representation of T cell peptides, is that it has a pool of MHC haplotypes grouped into MHC

T cell epitope CD4+ (MHC II epitope prediction) :

Similar to T cells, we performed CTL MHC class I and T cell CD4+ MHC class II analysis.
NetMHCIIpan 4.0 was used to predict the potential MHC II-associated peptides for the CD4+

We had chosen the twenty most common HLA DP (n=5), HLA DQ (n=5), and HLA DR (n=10)
haplotypes present in the world or India for the analysis(Shankarkumar, 2010; Shen et al.,
2018). HLA DR is more abundant in the human population; therefore, more numbers of HLA
DR were considered. The HLA DR MHC type includedDRB10101, DRB1_0301, DRB1_401,
DRB1_404, DRB1_0701, DRB1_0802, DRB1_0901, DRB1_1001, DRB1_1501, DRB1_1508. The
other major MHC types HLA DP and HLA DQ included DPA10103-DPB10201, DPA10103DPB10301, DPA10103-DPB10401, DPA10103-DPB10501, DPA10201-DPB10101 and HLADQA10101-DQB10501,

considered. The weak binders were eliminated. A total of 124 potential peptides was
obtained for the different sub haplotypes of HLA DR and 73 and 56for different sub
haplotypes of HLA DP and HLA DR, respectively. These peptides were further subjected to
antigenicity analysis similar to MHC class I CTL associated peptides with the threshold of 0.7
to obtain super peptides. A total of 23 super peptides associated with different HLA DR
haplotypes were obtained (Table 3A), while six peptides and eight peptides were obtained
for HLA DP and HLA DQ, respectively (Table 3B and Table 3C).
Comparison between the antigenic peptides from S protein of reference genome
NC_045512 and Indian genome MT012098 showed that

404

DEVIQIAPGQTGKIA41 and

398

SFVIRGDEVIQIAPG412 were unique to Indian S protein (MT012098 genome) while

NDPFLGVYYHKNNKS151 and

404

GDEVRQIAPGQTGKI418 were obtained from S protein of

Reference genome NC_045512 and not from the Indian S protein MT012098 genome.
In addition to the S protein, the antigenic potential of N protein of MT012098 genome with
respect to the MHC class II association was also analyzed. As previously shown in the paper,
there is a100% match for the blast result for N protein of reference (NC_045512) with the N
protein derived from the Indian (MT012098) isolate genome. No variation in antigenicity
between them would, therefore,be observed. The N protein analysis included all the MHC II
types, which were also used for the S protein analysis. A total of 5 peptides were observed
to be super peptides across the MHC types. The peptide 328GTWLTYTGAIKLDDK342 was found
to be the most dominant N protein antigenic super peptide, which displayed polymorphism
for various MHC types; these included DRB1_0101, DRB1_0701, DRB1_0901, DRB1_1508,
and DPA10201-DPB10101 (Table 4A).
Conservation analysis: The B and T cell epitopes were analyzed for their conservation across

different genomes of SARS CoV-2. Fourteen different genomes across the globe were
compared with each antigenic peptide these include Reference Genome ( NC_045512),
Genomes sequenced for India (MT012098, MT050493). Genome sequenced for USA
(MN985325, MT300186), Genome sequence from Italy (MT066156, MT077125), Genome
sequenced from Greece (MT328032), Spain (MT292570), Australia (MT007544), Taiwan
(MT066175), Japan ( LC534419), Brazil(MT126808), and Iran (MT320891).

For B cell

epitopes for MT012098, S protein, 34 out of 36 peptides were 100% conserved while
peptides 94'STEKSN'99 and368' YNSASFSTFKCYGVSPTKLNDLCFT' 392 were only 7.2% conserved.

'RRGPEQTQGNFGDQELIRQGTDYK'299 were 93.86% conserved (Table 1A and Table 1B). All

the potential B cell peptides for M and E proteins were 100% conserved (Table 1C and Table
1D). For the B cell epitopes, peptides that were exclusive to the reference genome, 6 out of

8 were 100% conserved. This suggests an interesting scenario that this sequence, though
was present in all the different genomes, possibly didn't emerge as potential antigenic
peptides, probably due to variations in the neighboring amino acids. This suggests that
neighboring amino acids play an important role in determining antigenicity. The peptides
which were not 100% conserved were

The T cell CTL Super peptides besides being highly antigenic were also highly conserved. For
MT012098, S protein 97 out of 98 potential super peptides were 100% conserved while

Conclusion and Future Directions :

SARS-CoV-2 is a contagious and highly pathogenic virus associated with adverse respiratory
pathology. It is a positive single-stranded RNA virus. COVID-19 caused due to this virus is
transmitted to and among humans by direct contact, droplet, and airborne routes. It is
believed that this virus came originated from a zoonotic reservoir by cross-species spillover.
This virus was named due to its high homology (~80-85%) to SARS-CoV, which caused acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The mean incubation period is approximately five
Sdays. The confirmed case fatality ratio, or CFR (the total number of deaths divided by the
total number of confirmed cases at one point in time), is approx 3-3.5%. Within China, the
confirmed CFR, as reported by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, is
2.3%, though it could be higher in different populations. The primary problem of this disease
results in dysregulation of cytokines/chemokines, recruitment of immune cells with direct
virus-mediated cytopathic effects. Patients with severe diseases were reported to have
increased plasma concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-6,
IL-10, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1
(MCP1), macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)1α, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α along
with an associated lymphopenia. Using comprehensive genomic and proteomic tools, we
identified the different variants of SARS-CoV-2 in circulation within the world community.
We focused our analysis on the Indian stain MT012098 and identified unique T and B cell
epitopes that have high antigenicity and could serve as a potential vaccine candidate.
Complex Immunobiology and Interaction

Histopathological evidence reveals that upon SARS-CoV-2, infection in humans exhibits
nonspecific inflammatory responses, including edema and inflammatory cell infiltration
along with severe exfoliation of alveolar epithelial cells in an organized (Fu et al. 2020). In
addition, SARS-CoV-2 infection was found to cause pyroptosis in macrophages and
lymphocytes (Yang et al. 2020) Derangement of pulmonary arteriolar walls may be an
indicator of the crucial inflammatory response that contributes significantly to disease
progression or severity of Beta corona family virus, including SARS, MERS, and SARS-CoV-2.
At autopsy of SARS-CoV-2 cases reveals the lymphoid depletion in lymph nodes(Jiang Gu . et
al. 2005). Clinical features like lymphopenia and increasing viral load in the first few days of

the disease strongly propose the evasion of the immune system by SARS-CoV-2. Though the
data is limited, the host immune response to Beta coronavirus family, including SARS-CoV-2,
is a complex phenomenon with a multigenic network that yet to explore. Initially, the
involvement of ACE on SARS-CoV-2 infection and its facilitation into the host cell, the
complex immune phenomenon upon antigenic presentation through Pathogen associated
molecular pattern (PAMP) with the aid of TLRs family and its cytokines and chemokines
secretion may play a potential role for a varied range of disease prognosis(Frieman M et al.
2008, Tay MZ et al. 2020)
TLRs against β-coronavirus

It has been well established that exposure to lipids, peptides, and nucleic acids derived from
pathogenic agents (bacterial, viral, parasite, and fungal) are recognized by host Toll-like
receptors (TLRs) leading to their activation(Van Meer et al. 2008; Gay N et al. 2014). The
binding of antiviral components to TLRs activate downstream signaling pathways to release
cytokines as a primary inducer for inflammation and promotes secondary anti-inflammatory
mechanisms through PAMPs(Pathogen activated molecular patterns). Recognition of viral
glycoproteins by TLR2 and TLR4 are well established, and studies demonstrated that TLR2/6
heterodimers activate the innate immune response(Geng Li et al. 2020). It has been
observed that although the TLR1/2 heterodimers recognize viral glycoproteins, the potential
involvement of respiratory virus infection is unclear. Usually, TLRs recognize viral PAMPs
through common adaptor molecules, including MyD88, MAL, TRAM, and TRIF(Kawai et al.
2010). The TLR adaptor molecules signal through the IKKS/TBK1 complex and the
IKKα/IKKβ/IKKγ complex similarly may also involve IRAK-1/IRAK4/TRAF6 complex to activate
the transcription factors including IRF3, IRF7, and NF-κBthat ultimately activate IFNs and
produces proinflammatory cytokines(Pobezinskaya et al. 2008, Ermolaeva MA et al. 2008).
Previous in vivo study postulates that TLRs signaling programmed by MyD88 adaptor protein
and in mice model study reveals the potential involvement of TLR3/TLR4 on SARS-CoV
infection(Zheng et al. 2020, Perales et al 2013). The study documented that transgenic mice
deficient in the TLR3/TLR4 adaptor TRIF are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV infection,
showing increased weight loss, mortality, reduced lung function, increased lung pathology,
and higher viral titers. TLRs potentially involve differentiating between "self" and "nonself"
to the host immune system. TLRs, particularly TLR3/TLR4, seem to act as vaccine adjuvants

or antiviral molecules(Akira et al. .2006). The emergence of severe contagious βcoronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV, accompanied a significant
mortality ratio in human populations across the globe(Astuti and Ysrafil 2020). In spite of
the pandemic nature of the β-coronavirus family, the therapeutics or proper intervention
strategy is yet to formulate. Previous in-vivo and animal model data postulate that TLR
signaling

mediators,

and

protein(Kawasaki et al. 2014), may able to maintain the homeostasis of pro and antiinflammatory to perform effective antiviral defense mechanism against β-coronaviruses
family viruses including SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. Previous data insists us to postulate that
TLR antagonists may be crucial in coronavirus-specific vaccine and antiviral strategies(Nilsen
et al. 2015).
Chemokines and dendritic cells

Studies demonstrated the potential role of dendritic cells (D.C.s) as an antigen-presenting
cell for several RNA viruses. Genomic characterization of the SARS-CoV-2 potential N-linked
glycosylation and surface spike (S) protein is of high-mannose structure that may be crucial
for binding of SARS-CoV-2 and entry into the D.C.s. The mechanism may be mediated
CD206, CD209, CD207, and CD205. It has been also postulated the unique adaptive
mechanism for β-coronaviruses family viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, MERS, and SARS-CoV2, to escape host immune mechanisms. However, in-vitro studies demonstrated the
incomplete replication of SARS-CoV-2, where data for SARS-CoV-2 is essential to understand
the phenomenon. Altered homeostasis of antiviral pro and anti-inflammatory has been
postulated for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. D.C.s signal to 'nonself' for the adaptive immune
response to polarize T-helper (Th) cells toward the Th1/Th2 subsets. In-vitro studies also
reveal that cytokines include IFN-α, IFN-β, IFN-γ, and IL-12p40 reduce 3d expression on D.C.s
and upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6. The chemotactic
messengers, including chemokines, are potential candidates for leukocyte recruitment upon
single-stranded RNA virus infection. The up-regulation of chemokines has been associated
with viral diseases(Glass et al. 2003). In concordance with the detection of high-plasma
concentration of chemokines in patients with β-coronavirus postulated at least for SARSCoV-2 but need to explore for SARS-CoV-2. Mice model study also reveals the surge of
chemokines in the lungs on SARS-CoV–2 infection(Shi-Hui-Sun et al. 2020; Jason et al. 2008).

Elevation level was highest for inflammatory chemokines (macrophage inflammatory
protein (MIP)-1α/CCL3, secreted (RANTES)/CCL-5, interferon-inducible protein (IP10)/CXCL10 and monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1/CCL2 upon SARS-Co-V infection and
it may be true for other β-coronaviruses family viruses including SARS-CoV-2(Coperchini F,
2020; Zang et al. 2020). We postulated that this lack of antiviral cytokine response against a
background of intense chemokine upregulation could represent a mechanism of immune
evasion by SARS-CoV-2; however, the genomic heterogeneity of S and N protein between
SARS-CoV-2 and CARS-CoV-2 is essentially required to understand the immune escape
mechanism.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) acts as a cell receptor that facilitates viral entry to
the host cell(Bourgonje et al. 2020). The recent tissue-specific expressional analysis revealed
that

ACE2

expression levels were the highest in the intestine, kidneys, heart, and adipose

tissue, and moderate for lungs, liver, bladder, and adrenal gland(Zou et.al.2020;Qi F et. al.
2020) . A varied group of severity and its associated comorbidity upon SARS-CoV-2 infection
seems the outcome of differential immune responses due to the differential expressional
status of ACE2 under different pathological conditions.
Viral entry depends upon binding of viral spike (S) proteins with cellular ACE2 receptors and
primed by host proteases. The recent cellular study also demonstrates that serine protease
TMPRSS2 may act as a sound target to inhibit the viral entry to the host cell and may
neutralize the virus. Apart from that, ACE2 also postulated for its inflammatory immune
network with potential mediators like TLRs, Chemokines, and cytokines in several viral as
well as a complex disease. In this context, we tried to buildup interactome network model in
Cytoscape to understand the interaction, localization, and co-expression pathway prediction
with TLR8, IFNγ, CCR2 , ACE2 , CCR5 , TLR3 , TLR7 , TNFα to understand the response to the
virus, inflammatory response, positive regulation of cytokine production, cell chemotaxis
and regulation of inflammatory response. (Fig 5).

We may, therefore, conclude that a detailed molecular analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 Genome
will provide insight into its origin, evolution, genetic drift as well as potential antigenicity,
which can be exploited to develop an effective vaccine. Integrating in-silico based data with
available computational tools, we identified several potential antigenic epitopes in the
