Abstract
The infection of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 have caused more than 150,000 deaths, but no
vaccine or specific therapeutic antibody is currently available. SARS-CoV-2 relies on its spike
protein, in particular the receptor binding domain (RBD), to bind human cell receptor angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for viral entry, and thus targeting RBD holds the promise for
preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this work, a competitive biopanning strategy of a phage
display antibody library was applied to screen blocking antibodies against RBD. High-affinity
antibodies were enriched after the first round using a standard panning process in which RBD-His
recombinant protein was immobilized as a bait. At the next two rounds, immobilized ACE2-Fc and
free RBD-His proteins were mixed with the enriched phage antibodies. Antibodies binding to RBD
at epitopes different from ACE2-binding site were captured by the immobilized ACE2-Fc, forming
a “sandwich” complex. Only antibodies competed with ACE2 for recognizing RBD at the same or
similar epitopes can bind to the free RBD-His in the supernatant and be subsequently separated by
the Ni-NTA magnetic beads. Top 1 lead from the competitive biopanning of a synthetic antibody
library, Lib AB1, was produced as the full-length IgG1 format. It was proved to competitively block
the binding of RBD to ACE2 protein, and potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection of
ACE2-overexpressing Hela cells with IC50 values of 12nM. Nevertheless, top 1 lead from the
standard biopanning of Lib AB1, can only bind to RBD in vitro but not have the blocking or
neutralization activity. Our strategy can efficiently isolate the blocking antibodies of RBD, and it
would speed up the discovery of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.
Introduction
The recent outbreak of a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has emerged from a public
health emergency of international concern to global pandemic. Its pathogen, SARS-CoV-2, is a
newly identified β-coronavirus. Coronavirus got the family name from the spike(S) protein on the
viral particle. The highly glycosylated S protein stays compact in trimeric state, recognizes receptor
on the host cell membrane, and then undergoes a series of conformation changes, proteolysis events
and membrane fusion to complete viral entry. For vaccines, clinical diagnosis, early prevention and
medication, the S protein is the most significant target.
The primary sequences of S protein between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
(SARS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2 share about 76% identities and 86% similarities, which indicates
high possibility of structural homology and the same infection pathway. SARS-CoV and SARSCoV-2 recognized the same host cell receptor ACE2 for mediating viral entry into host cells. It was
reported that SARS-CoV S protein trimer bound to ACE2 at 1:1 in ratio [1,2]. Before infection, RBD
of each SARS-CoV S monomer was partially buried in the inactive “down” conformation and not

able to bind ACE2 due to steric clash. Once infection started, one monomer turned “up” its RBD to
expose enough space to ACE2, inducing further conformational open and loose for proteolysis [1,3].
Atomic-level structural analysis suggested that the spatial interaction and interface between SARSCoV-2 RBD and ACE2 was mostly in accordance with the SARS-CoV case [4]. Besides, a CryoEM structure of SARS-CoV-2 S protein trimer published recently showed that one of the three
RBDs was in “up” conformation and naturally exposed the whole interaction interface [5], while the
classic closed symmetric trimer still existed [6]. That might explain why SARS-CoV-2 is much more
contagious than SARS-CoV and causing tricky problems worldwide.
No effective cure or vaccine is currently available for COVID-19. Based on structure
information above, blocking SARS-CoV-2 RBD is a rational therapeutic approach. Here we
developed a competitive biopanning strategy to efficiently isolate blocking antibodies from phage
display antibody libraries. Several high-affinity antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 RBD and
blocking its binding to ACE2 were isolated, and the top 1 lead exhibited a neutralization activity of
SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped VSV infection.

Materials and Methods
Recombinant proteins
ACE2-His was purchased from Novoprotein (Shanghai, China). ACE2-hFc and SARS-CoV-2
RBD-His were purchased from Sino Biological (Beijing, China). SARS-CoV-2 RBD-mFc was
expressed using ABLINK Biotech’s HEK 293F expression system.
A Phage display antibody library
A synthetic human Fab antibody library AB1 (LibAB1) was constructed according to a procedure
previously described [7]. Human germline immunoglobulin variable segments VH3-30 and VL1-16
were employed as templates, the complementarity-determining regions L3 (CDR-L3) and H3
(CDR-H3) was diversified by the designed mutagenic oligonucleotides. The oligonucleotides were
synthesized using the trimer phosphoramidites mix Z (Glen Research) containing codons for 12
amino

acids

in

the

following

molar

ratios:

20% each Y, S &G, 6% each T & A, and

4% each P, H, R, F, W, V & L. The number of positions denoted by Z in CDR-L3 (QQ (Z)n PLT)
and -H3 (AR (Z) n (A/G/D/Y) FDY) was varied from 3 to 12 and 8 to 12, respectively. The library
size is estimated to be 1×1012.
Standard biopanning
Antibodies against RBD were screened at the first round using a standard biopanning protocol [8].
Briefly, RBD-His was coated on 96-well Maxisorp plates at 4°C overnight. After the coating buffer
was decanted, the plate was blocked with 1% polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) at room temperature for 1
hour. 100μl of phage libraries (1013 pfu/ml) was added per well for 2-hour binding. After washing
eight times with PT buffer (0.05% Tween-20 in PBS), bound phages were eluted with 100mM HCl
(100μl per well), followed by 5-min incubation. The eluent was transferred into a 1.5ml microfuge
tube and neutralized with 1M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Half the neutralized phage solution was mixed
with 1ml of actively growing E. coli NEB 5-alpha F’ (OD600 = 0.8) in 2×YT media containing
10μg/ml tetracycline and incubated at 37°C for 1 hour. 1010pfu of M13K07 helper phages were

added next and incubated for another 1 hour. The infected bacteria were amplified in 50ml 2×YT
medium containing 50μg/ml carbenicillin and 25μg/ml kanamycin, shaking at 200rpm and growing
overnight at 37°C. The next day, phages were harvested in precipitant with PEG/NaCl solution and
resuspended in PBS buffer for the following rounds of panning.
Competitive biopanning
After the first round of the standard biopanning, a competitive biopanning protocol that included
steps of competitive binding, magnetic separation, elution and amplification (Fig.1), was applied to
isolate the epitope-specific antibodies. Briefly, 100μl of ACE2-hFc protein (5μg/ml) was coated on
the 96-well Maxisorp plates. The wells were washed and blocked with 1% PVA, and then the
mixture of antibody library (1010pfu per well) and free RBD-His protein (100ng per well) was added.
After a 2-hour competitive binding, the supernatant was transferred into a 1.5ml microfuge tube
containing the pre-washed Ni-NTA magnetic beads (GenScript) and incubated on a shaker at room
temperature for 1 hour. Beads were collected using the magnetic separation rack and washed by the
PT buffer for 8 times. Bound phages were eluted with 100mM HCl (100μl per tube) after 5-min
incubation. Beads were collected using the magnetic separation rack, and the supernatant was
transfer into a tube for neutralization. Half the neutralized phage solution was mixed with 1ml of
actively growing NEB alpha F’ cells and amplified as the standard biopanning protocol. 10μl of the
bacterial culture before infection with helper phages was taken, diluted, and grown on the LB plates
containing 50μg/ml carbenicillin at 37°C overnight. The single clones were picked up next day for
the phage ELISA assay.

Fig.1 Schematic presentation of a competitive biopanning strategy. A specific binder of target
protein was added during the binding step for the selection of blocking antibodies. In this work, the
immobilized ACE2-hFc captured RBD-His and the antibodies binding RBD at different epitopes,
forming a complex like a “sandwich”. However, when an antibody recognized the same or similar
epitopes within RBD as the ACE2 did, it could block RBD-ACE2 interaction. The antibodies would
bind to the free RBD-His in the supernatant and be subsequently separated by the Ni-NTA magnetic
beads.

Phage ELISA
Single clones were inoculated into 400μl 2×YT medium containing 50μg/ml carbenicillin, 25μg/ml
kanamycin and 1010 pfu/ml helper phages in 96-deep-well plates and incubated overnight at 37°C
and 250rpm. The plates were centrifuged at 4,000rpm and the supernatant was applied for phage
ELISA. The 96-well Maxisorp plates were coated overnight at 4°C with RBD-mFc (1μg/ml, 100μl
per well). After blocking with 1% PVA, plates were incubated with 50μl bacterial supernatant
containing phages for 2 hours at room temperature. After six times of wash with PT, bound phages
were detected using an HRP-conjugated anti-M13 antibody (Sino biological) and tetramethyl
benzidine (TMB) as substrate. Absorption at 450nm was measured.
IgG Expression and Purification
VH and VL of the positive phage were subcloned respectively into the pFUSEss-CHIg-hG1 and
pFUSEss-CLIg-hK (Invitrogen). Antibodies were transiently expressed in FreeStyle™ HEK 293‐F
cells (Life Technologies) using 293fectin transfection reagent according to manufacturer’s
instructions. After transfection, cells were grown in the serum-free medium for an additional 5 days.
The supernatant was collected and purified on a MabSelect Protein A column (GE healthcare).
Eluted IgG was dialyzed against PBS and stored at -80°C.
Competitive blocking ELISA
Recombinant human ACE2-His (5μg/ml, 100μl per well) was coated on 96-well Maxisorp plates,
followed by a pre-incubated mixture of the anti-RBD antibody titrated into a constant amount of
RBD-mFc (1µg/ml). RBD binding to ACE2 was detected using HRP conjugated anti-mouse Fc
antibody.
Pseudotyped virus neutralization assay
The neutralization effects of antibodies on SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus were performed by the
Genscript Inc. (Nanjing, China) under a research service contract. Briefly, 20,000 of the human
ACE2-overexpressing Hela monoclonal cells were seeded into each well of a 96-well plate. SARSCoV-2 pseudovirus and antibodies were incubated at ambient temperature for 1 hour. The mixture
was transferred into wells and incubated with cells at 37°C, 5% CO 2 for 24 hours. The culture
medium was freshly replaced, and cells were incubated for another 24 hours. The culture medium
was removed, and cells were rinsed with PBS. 50µl lysis buffer was added and further incubated at
ambient temperature for 40 minutes. 40µl supernatant was transferred to a Sterile Un-Clear 96-well
plate with the Bio-Glo luciferase substrate added, and the luminescence signal was measured with
EnVision. The dose response curves were plotted with the relative luminescence unit against the
antibody concentration. The assay results were processed by Microsoft Office Excel 2013 and
GraphPad Prism 6.
Results
High-affinity antibodies were identified by the Phage ELISA
After 2 rounds of the competitive biopanning, 48 clones were randomly selected. Their properties
of binding to RBD were measured using phage ELISA. Positive binding was defined as an OD450
reading two or more times higher than the negative control (PVA alone). 18 clones showed positive
signals (Fig.2). After the DNA sequencing, these clones were summarized into 5 groups of unique

antibodies.

readings as measurement, data of each group fluctuated within 20%. The highest-ranking one was
named rRBD-15 in this work.
Binding and blocking abilities of the top 1 leads against RBD
rRBD-15, the top1 lead with the highest OD450 reading isolated from the competitive biopanning,
and rRBD-16, the top 1 lead isolated from the standard biopanning at round 3, were expressed as
full-length IgG1 antibodies using the 293F expression system. Their binding and blocking abilities
against RBD were compared. Both rRBD-15 and rRBD-16 had high affinities for RBD, with EC50
at 3.8nM and 5.3nM, respectively. Only rRBD-15 blocked the binding of RBD to ACE2 with an
IC50 at 3.0nM, while rRBD-16 did not.

antibodies were detected by SDS-PAGE and stained with typan blue. (B) The binding of antibodies
to RBD-mFc protein was measured by ELISA. (C) The activities of antibodies blocking the

Neutralization abilities of the top 1 leads against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus
As a positive control, the recombinant ACE2-hFc (100µg/ml) totally inhibited the infection of
ACE2-overexpressing Hela monoclonal cells with SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. The antibody rRBD15 showed a significant neutralization activity against the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus with IC50
values of 12.2nM. However, the antibody rRBD-16 had no neutralization effect of the pseudovirus
and there were no significant differences between the highest concentration antibody group and the
blank group without antibody addition.

different neutralization activities. The antibody rRBD-15 competed with ACE2 could neutralize
SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus, but rRBD-16 couldn’t.
Discussion
RBD-ACE2 interaction initiated viral infection of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Their RBDs
share high sequence identities (73%) and structure homology, so the well-established SARS-CoV
antibodies were firstly assumed short-cut therapeutic candidates for SARS-CoV-2. However, the
real scenario is much more problematic. Several independent peer-reviewed studies as well as
preprinted ones have proved that all structurally known SARS-CoV specific antibodies, including
S230, 80R, m396 and F26G19, have no cross-reactivity of SARS-CoV-2[4,5,9]. These antibodies all
compete with ACE2 to bind SARS-CoV RBD, but their epitopes only have limited overlaps of the
full ACE2-RBD interface, which could be the reason of lacking cross-reactivity. CR3022 is a special
case with 86% conserved key residues in the epitope between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. Its
cross-reactivity was remarkable, but one site loss of N-glycan results in 1~2 magnitude reduction
of binding affinity to SARS-CoV-2 RBD [9]. As in human life, RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies
derived from COVID-19 recovered individuals indicated similar patterns of no cross-reactivities
with either SAR-CoV or MERS-CoV [10].
In general, structural and functional analysis suggests that targeting SARS-CoV-2 RBD could be a
direct and promising therapeutic strategy, while focusing on previous SARS-CoV antibodies is not
very ideal or efficient. No SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific monoclonal antibody has been reported from
human antibody libraries (up to April 17th, 2020). In the meantime, SARS-CoV-2 spreads
unexpectedly fast around the world, and a new study just shifted its basic reproductive number (R0)
from 2.2 to 5.7 [11]. A rapid and effective method of obtaining the SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing
antibodies is much required.
Naï
ve antibody libraries derived from natural immune systems have their capacity limits, while
synthetic libraries with higher diversity have more opportunities to isolate binders especially for
novel infectious antigens. Compared to a naï
ve antibody library of 108~109 diversity, a synthetic
library with additional artificial randomization on CDRs can reach diversity as high as 1012~1013.
When the recombinant RBD and ACE2 proteins were ready, it took 3 weeks to isolate, produce and
verify the antibodies in this study. Using the standard biopanning method, we enriched RBDspecific phages from our synthetic Lib AB1 but not from our naï
ve antibody libraries (data not
shown). Unfortunately, the top1 lead rRBD-16 from the standard biopanning of Lib AB1 couldn’t
block the RBD-ACE2 interaction (Fig. 4), although it did bind to RBD with an EC50 of 5.3nM (Fig.
3).
The clinical potential and applications of an antibody often depends on its binding epitopes of the
target protein. A high-affinity antibody against the target protein can be screened from a phage
display antibody library using the standard biopanning process, but its binding epitopes are
identified by some extra steps, such as epitope mapping and competitive ELISA. We therefore
developed a new competitive biopanning strategy to efficiently isolate isotype-specific antibodies
from libraries. As expected, the top1 lead rRBD-15 successfully bind to RBD in compete with ACE2
both in solution and in pseudovirus, and its binding affinity is quite high in 1~10nM differing from
measuring methods. In conclusion, our strategic discovery of human monoclonal antibodies against
SARS-CoV-2 RBD may fill the blanks of antibody-related pharmaceutical development and shed
