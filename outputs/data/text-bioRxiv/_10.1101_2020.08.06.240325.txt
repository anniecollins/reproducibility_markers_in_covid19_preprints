Summary
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) results from an infection by the severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the third coronavirus outbreak to plague humanity
this century. Currently, the most efficacious therapeutic against SARS-CoV-2 infection is the
Remdesivir (RDV), an adenine-like ribonucleotide analogue that is very efficiently
incorporated by the SARS-CoV-2 replicase. Understanding why RDV is so well incorporated
will facilitate development of even more effective therapeutics. Here, we have applied a highthroughput, single-molecule, magnetic-tweezers platform to study thousands of cycles of
nucleotide addition by the SARS-CoV-2 replicase in the absence and presence of RDV, a
Favipiravir-related analog (T-1106), and the endogenously produced ddhCTP. Our data are
consistent with two parallel catalytic pathways of the replicase: a high-fidelity catalytic (HFC)
state and a low-fidelity catalytic (LFC) state, the latter allowing the slow incorporation of both
cognate and non-cognate nucleotides. ddhCTP accesses HFC, T-1106 accesses LFC as a noncognate nucleotide, while RDV efficiently accesses both LFC pathway. In contrast to previous
reports, we provide unequivocal evidence against RDV functioning as a chain terminator. We
show that RDV incorporation transiently stalls the replicase, only appearing as termination
events when traditional, gel-based assays are used. The efficiency of ddhCTP utilization by the
SARS-CoV-2 replicase suggests suppression of its synthesis during infection, inspiring new
therapeutic strategies. Use of this experimental paradigm will be essential to the development
of therapeutic nucleotide analogs targeting polymerases.

Introduction
SARS-CoV-2 has infected almost twenty million humans worldwide, causing approximately
700,000 deaths as August 5th, with numbers still on the rise. We are currently living through
the third coronavirus outbreak in less than twenty years, and we are desperately in need of
broad-spectrum antiviral drugs that are capable of targeting this emerging family of human
pathogens. To this end, nucleotide analogues (NAs) represent a powerful approach, as they
target the functionally and structurally conserved coronavirus replicase, and their insertion in
the viral RNA induces either premature termination or a lethal increase in mutations. The
coronavirus replicase is composed of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) nsp12, and
the nsp7 and nsp8 co-factors, with a stoichiometry of 1:1:2

1-4

. This core replicase associates

with several additional viral proteins, including the 5’-to-3’ helicase nsp13 5 and the 3’-to-5’
exonuclease nsp14

. The latter proofreads the RNA synthesized by the high error prone

RdRp nsp12 12, a unique feature of coronavirus in the RNA virus world, and therefore plays a

central role in contributing to the stability of the unusually large coronavirus genome, i.e. ~30
kb. Furthermore, nsp14 confers coronavirus resistance against many established NAs (e.g.,
ribavirin 13) and therefore presents a challenge for the development of potent NAs. Remdesivir

. The success of

RDV relies on its efficient incorporation by nsp12 16, and probable evasion from excision by
nsp14 6. Understanding how RDV achieves these two tasks will help to guide the rational design
of more efficacious NAs for the current and future outbreaks. To this end, it is essential to build
a comprehensive model describing the selection and incorporation mechanisms that control the
utilization of NAs by coronavirus replicase and to define the determinants of the base and ribose
responsible for selectivity and potency. The generation of such model is however hampered by
the inability of standard biochemical techniques to work in physiological conditions involving
saturating concentrations of competing NTP and kilobase-long template, while maintaining
single base resolution.

Results
Monitoring SARS-CoV-2 replication at the single molecule level
To enable the observation of rare events, such as nucleotide mismatch and NA incorporation,
even in the presence of saturating NTP concentration, we have developed a single molecule,
high throughput, magnetic tweezers assay to monitor SARS-CoV-2 replication activity at near
single base resolution 20. A SARS-CoV-2 replicase formed of nsp12, nsp7 and nsp8 assembles
and initiates replication at the 3’ end of the magnetic bead-attached handle, and converts the
1043 nt long single stranded RNA template into a double-stranded (ds) RNA in the presence of
NTPs (Fig. 1a, Extended data Fig. 1ab, Materials and Methods). The magnetic bead
displacement along the vertical axis directly informs on the number of incorporated nucleotides
(Fig. 1a, Materials and Methods) 21. During each experiment, hundreds of magnetic beads are
followed in parallel (Extended data Fig. 1c), providing dozens of SARS-CoV-2 replication
activity traces per experiment (Fig. 1b). As previously observed for other viral RdRps 20-22, the
traces present a lot of dynamics, with bursts of activity interrupted by pauses of duration varying
from ~0.5 s to ~60 s in Fig. 1b. To extract the elongation kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 replicase,
we scanned the traces with non-overlapping windows of 10 nt to measure the ten successive
nucleotide incorporations total duration, which we coined dwell time

20-22

(Materials and

Methods). We fitted the distribution of dwell times using the stochastic-pausing model that
describes well the fidelity and kinetics of nucleotide addition of viral RdRps

20-23

(Fig. 1c,

Materials and Methods), and in particular for poliovirus RdRp, a prototypical enterovirus
RdRp to which SARS-CoV-1 nsp12 ressembles the most 1. This model is composed of four
distributions, describing the pause-free nucleotide addition rate, Pause 1, Pause 2 and the longlived pauses (Fig. 1c). Statistics and all parameter values extracted from the analysis are
reported in Extended data Table 1. Viral RdRps, such as the one of poliovirus, are robustly
described by a kinetic model where the nucleotide addition rate is the kinetic signature of a fast
and high fidelity catalytic (HFC) state, from which the RdRp stochastically and rarely switches
into a lower fidelity catalytic (LFC) state that runs parallel to the HFC state (Fig. 1d) 20-22. Pause
1 and Pause 2 are the kinetic signatures of the LFC state, and relate to the slow incorporation
of a cognate base following either a cognate, i.e. diagonal arrow in Fig. 1d, or a mismatch base
incorporation, i.e. terminal mismatch catalytic state (TMC) in Fig. 1d, respectively. On the
other hand, the long-lived pauses relate to a catalytically incompetent state 21. Increasing the
temperature from 25°C to 37°C, SARS-CoV-2 replicase reveals a strong temperature
dependence, which translates into a 2-fold decrease in median of the total replication time, from
(25 ± 1) 𝑠𝑠 to (12.0 ± 0.4) 𝑠𝑠 (median ± standard deviation (Fig. 1e)), while not affecting the
replication product length (Fig. 1f). Analyzing the dwell time distribution at 25 and 37°C (Fig.

1g), we extracted a ~2.6-fold enhancement in nucleotide addition rate, i.e. from
(65.6 ± 0.5) 𝑠𝑠 −1 to (169 ± 4) 𝑠𝑠 −1, making nsp12 the fastest RNA polymerase characterized
to date (Fig. 1h). Pause 1 and Pause 2 exit rates also increased by ~2-fold (Fig. 1h), whereas

their respective probabilities increased by 2- and 5-fold (Extended data Fig. 1d). The latter
results are rather surprising, as enterovirus RdRps showed only an exit rate increase with no
change in probability 22.

3’-dATP versus Remdesivir-TP: two ATP competitors, two modes of incorporation
Next, we investigated how the elongation kinetics and the product length of SARS-CoV-2
replicase were affected by two adenosine analogues, i.e. 3’-dATP and RDV-TP (Extended
data Fig. 2). 3’-dATP is an obligatory terminator and a recent study showed that
dideoxynucleotides were incorporated by SARS-CoV-1 replicase 8. In the presence of 500 µM
NTP and 500 µM 3’-dATP, SARS-CoV-2 replication demonstrated an increase in the number
of traces that did not reach the end of the template (1043 nt) (Fig. 2a versus Fig. 1b). Indeed,
increasing 3’-dATP concentration up to 2000 µM, i.e. a stoichiometry equal to four, reduced
the mean product length of SARS-CoV-2 replicase by ~1.7-fold, i.e. from (940 ± 13) 𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛 to
(566 ± 33 ) 𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛 (mean ± standard deviation) (Fig. 2b), while neither affected the replication
time nor the elongation kinetics (Fig. 2c, Extended data Fig. 3abc). We derived a model to

determine the effective incorporation rate 𝛾𝛾 of a NA chain terminator against an equimolar

concentration of the competing nucleotide, i.e. a stoichiometry of 1 (Materials and Methods).
This model fits very well the mean product length as a function of 3’-dATP stoichiometry
against ATP (Fig. 2b), i.e. 𝛾𝛾3′ −𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑,500 µ𝑀𝑀 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 = (780 ± 64) 𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛, meaning that the replicase
incorporates on average 780 nt before incorporating one 3’-dATP and terminating replication

(Materials and Methods). A subsaturating concentration of NTP increases the probability to
enter the LFC state (Fig. 1d) 20,21, i.e. Pause 1 and Pause 2 probability, and would increase the
effective incorporation rate of 3’-dATP, providing it is incorporated via the LFC state.
Decreasing ATP concentration from 500 to 50 µM, we observed an increase in Pause 1 and
Pause 2 probabilities by more than 2-fold and 3-fold, i.e. from (0.060 ± 0.002) to
(0.149 ± 0.005)

and

from

(0.0033 ± 0.0009) to

(0.0115 ± 0.0026),

respectively

(Extended data Fig. 3a-f), respectively, and the replication traces appeared shorter than at 500
µM ATP (Fig. 2d). However, the effective incorporation rate of 3’-dATP was identical at both
concentrations of ATP, i.e. 𝛾𝛾3′ −𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑,50 µ𝑀𝑀 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 = (777 ± 50) 𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛 (Fig. 2e), which indicates that

3’-dATP incorporation is only driven by stoichiometry, despite the significant increase in the
LFC state probabilities (Pause 1 and Pause 2). Therefore, we conclude that 3’-dATP is
incorporated through the HFC state (Fig. 1d). This interpretation is further supported by steady
state kinetics analysis of 3’-dATP incorporation by poliovirus RdRp, which showed that 3’dATP is much more promiscuous than any mismatch on a uracil 24. Of note, the decrease in the
median replication time is due to the shortening of the product length from early termination
(Extended data Fig. 3g). Despite its good incorporation rate, 3’-dATP is not a good candidate
to treat coronavirus infection, because of its toxicity 25. Therefore, a less toxic and promiscuous
NA is required to compete against ATP. RDV-TP is an adenine analogue with a 1’-cyano
modification that has recently been shown to outcompete ATP for incorporation

16

, while

having a low cytotoxicity 26. RDV-TP has been proposed to induce delayed chain termination
at i+3 (i being RDV incorporation position) during coronavirus replication

15,16

. Adding 100

µM RDV-TP in a reaction buffer containing 500 µM NTPs showed a dramatic increase in the
pause density and duration, while most of the traces reached the end of the template (Fig. 2f).
We indeed observed a final product length largely unaffected at all concentrations of RDV-TP
(Fig. 2g), while the median replication time increased by more than 10-fold, i.e. from
(25 ± 1) 𝑠𝑠 to (315 ± 14) 𝑠𝑠 (Fig. 2h) for RDV-TP concentration increasing up to 300 µM.
Therefore, the RDV-TP mechanism of action is not termination. We then investigated the origin

of the pause induced by RDV-TP incorporation using our pause-stochastic model (Fig. 2i,
Extended data Fig. 4a). While the nucleotide addition rate is unaffected by RDV-TP, all

pauses are significantly impacted. The exit rates of Pause 1 and Pause 2 decreased by 4- and
10-fold (Fig. 2j), while their probabilities increased by 2- and 4-fold, respectively (Fig. 2k).
Most notably, the long-lived pause probability increased by 28-fold, i.e. from (0.0005 ±

0.0001) to (0.0142 ± 0.0015) when increasing RDV-TP concentration up to 300 µM. The

long-lived pause probability increase was such that it most likely affected the probability and
the exit rates of Pause 1 and Pause 2 above 50 µM RDV-TP (Fig. 2k). To better disentangle
the pause distributions, we performed a SARS-CoV-2 replication experiments at 37°C with 100

µM RDV-TP (Extended data Fig. 4b). We observed the same nucleotide addition rate with
and without RDV-TP (Fig. 1bef), while Pause 1 and Pause 2 exit rates significantly decreased
by 3- and 9-fold, respectively (Extended data Fig. 4c). On the other hand, Pause 1 and Pause
2 probabilities were unaffected by the presence of RDV-TP (Extended data Fig. 4d),
supporting the notion that the increase in probability in the experiments performed at 25°C was
the consequence of the long-lived pauses biasing Pause 1 and Pause 2 distributions 20. The longlived pause probability increased by more than 7-fold, i.e. from (0.0003 ± 0.0001) to
(0.0022 ± 0.0007). As RDV-TP incorporation pauses SARS-CoV-2 replicase, incorporation

via the HFC state would increase a probability of Pause 1 and Pause 2. Here, we observed
constant probabilities for Pause 1 and Pause 2, while their respective exit rates decreased,
suggesting that RDV-TP is incorporated through the LFC state, behaving like a cognate
(diagonal arrow in Fig. 1d) and as a non-cognate base (TMC, Fig. 1d), i.e. not opposite uracil.
As expected, the almost identical SARS-CoV-1 replicase1 demonstrated a similar kinetic
signature to RDV-TP incorporation (Extended data Fig. 5a-f, Table 1), though to a lesser
extent, e.g. the long-lived pause probability increased by ~9-fold when raising RDV-TP
concentration up to 300 µM versus 28-fold for SARS-CoV-2 replicase.

T-1106-TP is incorporated via the LFC state and with a low probability
Pyrazine-carboxamide is a promising family of antiviral NA, from which the best-known
member is Favipiravir (T-705), recently approved to treat influenza virus infection

27

, and

considered against SARS-CoV-2. We studied here another member of this family, T-1106
triphosphate (T-1106-TP), which is chemically more stable than T-705, while presenting
similar antiviral properties 12,20. T-1106-TP competes for incorporation against ATP and GTP
in a sequence-dependent context

12,20

. Adding 500 µM of T-1106-TP in a reaction buffer

containing 500 µM NTPs significantly increased the number and duration of pauses observed
in SARS-CoV-2 replication traces (Fig. 3a), leading to a 2.6-fold increase in median replication
time, i.e. from (25 ± 1) 𝑠𝑠 to (65 ± 4) 𝑠𝑠 (Fig. 3b). For comparison, 50 µM of RDV-TP induced

a median replication time of (72 ± 6) 𝑠𝑠 at the same concentration of competing NTP,
suggesting that RDV-TP is better incorporated than T-1106-TP. The final product length was

not affected by T-1106-TP, supporting that T-1106-TP mechanism of action is not termination
(Fig. 3c). Investigating how increasing T-1106-TP concentration affects SARS-CoV-2
replication kinetics (Fig. 3d, Extended data Fig. 6), we found that only Pause 2 exit rate was
affected, decreasing by 10-fold, i.e. from (1.59 ± 0.21) 𝑠𝑠 −1 to (0.16 ± 0.01) 𝑠𝑠 −1 (Fig. 3e). On
the other hand, Pause 1 and Pause 2 probabilities remained constant (Extended data Fig. 3f).

Our results suggest an incorporation of T-1106-TP via the LFC state, but only on the mismatch
pathway, i.e. the TMC state (Extended data Fig. 1d), which explains its lesser promiscuity
than RDV-TP. Interestingly, the probability to enter the long-lived pause state increased by
almost 5-fold, i.e. from (0.0005 ± 0.0001) to (0.0023 ± 0.0004) (Fig. 3f). For poliovirus
RdRp, we observed that T-1106-TP incorporation induced pauses with context dependent

durations 20, and we suggest that the incorporation of T-1106-TP in a different sequence context
may result in pauses of different natures, i.e. Pause 2 and long-lived pause.

ddhCTP represents a promising NA against coronavirus infection
Finally, we have compared two chain terminators, i.e. Sofosbuvir and ddhCTP. Sofosbuvir is a
uridine analog and FDA approved drug to treat hepatitis C virus infection
incorporated by SARS-CoV-2 replicase

16,19

28,29

and is

. 3ʹ-deoxy-3′,4ʹ-didehydro-CTP (ddhCTP) is a

recently discovered natural antiviral NA produced in mammalian cells by the viperin-catalyzed
conversion of CTP via a radical-based mechanism

30

. While ddhCTP has been shown to

efficiently terminate flavivirus replication both in vitro and in vivo, its antiviral activity against
SARS-CoV-2 replicase remains unknown. The presence of 500 µM Sofosbuvir-TP with 500
µM NTP did not affect the replication of SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 4a), while early termination events
appeared in the presence of 500 µM ddhCTP (Fig. 4b). Supporting this visual observation,
SARS-CoV-2 mean replication product length was unaffected by the presence of SofosbuvirTP (Fig. 4c), while raising the ddhCTP (Fig. 4d) stoichiometry against CTP up to 4 reduced
the mean product length from (940 ± 13) 𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛 to (622 ± 24) 𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛, showing an effective

incorporation rate 𝛾𝛾𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑ℎ𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶,500 µ𝑀𝑀 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 = (1221 ± 130) 𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛 (Fig. 4d). For both NAs, the

replication time was unaffected (Extended data Fig. 7a and 8a), as well as SARS-CoV-2

replication kinetics (Extended data Fig. 7b-d and 7f-h). Reducing the concentration of their
respective competing NTP down to 50 µM and keeping the other NTPs at 500 µM, SofosbuvirTP showed few early termination events when added at 500 µM (Fig. 4e), while only a small
number of traces reached the end of the template at the same concentration of ddhCTP (Fig.

4f). The analysis showed a limited impact of Sofosbuvir-TP on the mean product length, i.e.
with a minimum of (563 ± 32) 𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛 at a stoichiometry of 20 (Fig. 4g), while ddhCTP was more
effectively incorporated, shortening the mean product length down to (284 ± 23) 𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛 at the
same stoichiometry (Fig. 4h). Their respective effective incorporation rate at stoichiometry of
1

reflected

these

observations,

i.e.

𝛾𝛾𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠,50 µ𝑀𝑀 𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈 = (3908 ± 467) 𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛

and

𝛾𝛾𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑ℎ𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶,50 µ𝑀𝑀 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 = (1360 ± 71) 𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛. In other words, SARS-CoV-2 replicase incorporates in

average 3908 and 1360 nt before incorporating a single Sofosbuvir-TP and ddhCTP,
respectively, and terminate replication. Replication kinetics were unaffected by the presence of
ddhCTP or Sofosbuvir-TP, while their median replication time mildly decreased at high
stoichiometry, highlighting the shortening of the replication product (Extended data Fig. 7ah and 8a-h, respectively). As for 3’-dATP, our data suggest that stoichiometry against the
competing NTP regulates Sofosbuvir-TP and ddhCTP incorporation, which are therefore
incorporated via the HFC state (Fig. 1d). On the one hand, our data confirmed the poor
incorporation of Sofosbuvir by SARS-CoV-2

16,31

. On the other hand, ddhCTP showed an

interesting increase in termination activity at physiological CTP concentration, opening great
perspectives for ddhCTP as an effective anti-coronavirus NA with a low cytotoxicity.

Discussion
We present here the first observation of SARS-CoV-2 replication activity at the single molecule
level. We show that SARS-CoV-2 replicase is the fastest RNA polymerase to date, replicating
up to ~170 nt/s at 37°C. With our assay we characterized the incorporation rate and mechanism
of action of several NAs, i.e. 3’-dATP, Sofosbuvir-TP, ddhCTP, T-1106-TP and RDV-TP.
Here, we showed that RDV-TP is incorporated by both pathways of the LFC state, i.e. as a
cognate base (diagonal arrow in Fig. 1d) and as a mismatch (TMC state in Fig. 1d). In contrast,
T-1106-TP is only incorporated via the TMC state. At a saturating concentration of NTP, Pause
1 (kinetic signature of cognate base incorporation by LFC) and Pause 2 (kinetic signature of
mismatch incorporation by LFC) respectively account for ~6% and ~0.3% of all the nucleotide
addition events, which therefore defines an upper limit for RDV-TP and T-1106-TP relative
incorporation, and explains why RDV-TP is much better incorporated than Favipiravir31. A
recent study performed at submicromolar NTPs showed that RDV-TP is three times better
incorporated than ATP 16. At such low NTP concentration, the LFC state is predominant over
the HFC state 20,21, which would suggest that the measured selectivity is only valid for the LFC
state. Nonetheless, RDV-TP may still be incorporated via the HFC state, generating a longlived pause, which would explain the observed surge in probability for this type of pause.

However, other explanations for this surge are also likely, e.g. multiple RDV-TP incorporation
in a single dwell time, sequence-dependent context pause associated with RDV-TP
incorporation

20

. Importantly, we unambiguously showed that both RDV-TP and T-1106-TP

are not terminators, but rather slow down replication. Concerning obligatory terminators, the
effective incorporation rate we measured showed that 3’-dATP and ddhCTP are well
incorporated by SARS-CoV-2 replicase, while Sofosbuvir-TP is strongly outcompeted by UTP.
Interestingly, all of them are incorporated via the HFC state, i.e. behaving like a cognate base
(Fig. 1d), supporting a mechanism where base pairing is the main discriminator by which state,
i.e. HFC or LFC, is the analogue incorporated, and we are able to determine their respective
effective incorporation rate. A recent steady-state kinetic study showed that nucleotide
analogues modified at the 2’ and 3’ positions are strongly discriminated against their competing
natural nucleotide 16. Such selectivity is an issue for purine-based analogues which competes
with high concentrations of ATP and GTP in the cell, but not for pyrimidine-based analogues,
as derivatives of CTP, which compete with CTP at an intracellular concentration of ~100 µM
32

. These features make ddhCTP a particularly attractive antiviral NA. Furthermore, under

certain conditions, the interferon α-induced viperin converts up to 30% the cellular pool of CTP
into ddhCTP, further increasing its stoichiometry and favoring its potency 30. This may explain
why SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins inhibits the interferon response

33

. ddhCTP therefore

represents an exciting viral replication inhibitor with a low cytotoxicity and high efficacy.
Given these insighful results, we anticipate that our assay will become the new standard to
determine the selectivity and the mode of action of NAs. Future work will focus on assembling
a complete coronavirus replicase, e.g. including the helicase nsp13 and the exonuclease nsp14,
to evaluate their impact on SARS-CoV-2 replication, proofreading and NA efficacy.

Fig. 1. SARS-CoV-2 replicase is a fast and processive viral replication complex. a,
Schematic of magnetic tweezers assay to monitor RNA synthesis by the SARS-CoV-2 replicase
complex. A magnetic bead is attached to a glass coverslip surface by a 1043 long ssRNA
construct that experiences a constant force F. The replicase formed by nsp7, nsp8 and nsp12
assembles at the 3’-end of the RNA strand annealed to the template. The subsequent conversion
of the ssRNA template into dsRNA reduces the end-to-end extension of the tether, signaling
replication activity. b, SARS-CoV-2 replication traces acquired at either 25°C (gray) or 37°C
(black), showing bursts of nucleotide addition interrupted by pauses. The inset is a zoom-in of
the traces captured in the red square. c, The dwell times collected from (b) are assembled into
a distribution that is fitted using a pause-stochastic model (Materials and Methods) (solid
lines). The model includes four different probability distribution functions that describe the
event that kinetically dominates the dwell time: uninterrupted ten nucleotide additions (green);
exponentially distributed Pause 1 and 2 (blue and cyan, respectively); and the power law
distributed long-lived pauses (red). d, The dwell time distribution in (c) is described by the viral
RdRp kinetic model (adapted from Ref. 21). Nucleotide addition is achieved via two competing
pathways, i.e. the high fidelity catalytic (HFC) state and the low fidelity catalytic (LFC) state,
which leads to either cognate, i.e. diagonal arrow, or non cognate nucleotide incorporation, i.e.
terminal mismatch catalytic (TMC). The former dominates at high NTP concentration, is fast
and accurate, while the latter dominates at low NTP concentration, is slow and error prone.
Pause 1 and Pause 2 are the kinetic signature of cognate and mismatch nucleotide additions,
respectively, by the LFC state. e, Total replication time and f, replication product length of
SARS-CoV-2 replication activity at either 25°C or 37°C. The median total replication time and

Materials and methods
High throughput magnetic tweezers apparatus
The high throughput magnetic tweezers used in this study have been described in detail
elsewhere 34. Shortly, a pair of vertically aligned permanent magnets (5 mm cubes,
SuperMagnete, Switzerland) separated by a 1 mm gap are positioned above a flow cell (see
paragraph below) that is mounted on a custom-built inverted microscope. The vertical position
and rotation of the magnets are controlled by two linear motors, M-126-PD1 and C-150 (Physik
Instrumente PI, GmbH & Co. KG, Karlsruhe, Germany), respectively. The field of view is
illuminated through the magnets gap by a collimated LED-light source, and is imaged onto a
large chip CMOS camera (Dalsa Falcon2 FA-80-12M1H, Stemmer Imaging, Germany) using
a 50× oil immersion objective (CFI Plan Achro 50 XH, NA 0.9, Nikon, Germany) and an
achromatic doublet tube lens of 200 mm focal length and 50 mm diameter (Qioptic, Germany).
To control the temperature, we used a system described in details in Ref. 22. Shortly, a flexible
resistive foil heater with an integrated 10MΩ thermistor (HT10K, Thorlabs) is wrapped around
the microscope objective and further insulated by several layers of kapton tape (KAP22-075,
Thorlabs). The heating foil is connected to a PID temperature controller (TC200 PID controller,
Thorlabs) to adjust the temperature within ∼0.1°.

Recombinant Protein Expression of RdRp (nsp12) and cofactors (nsp7 and nsp8) from SARSCoV-2
This protocol was described in Ref. 19. SARS-CoV-2 nsp12: The SARS-CoV-2 nsp12 gene was
codon optimized and cloned into pFastBac with C-terminal additions of a TEV site and strep
tag (Genscript). The pFastBac plasmid and DH10Bac E. coli (Life Technologies) were used to
create recombinant bacmids. The bacmid was transfected into Sf9 cells (Expression Systems)
with Cellfectin II (Life Technologies) to generate recombinant baculovirus. The baculovirus
was amplified through two passages in Sf9 cells, and then used to infect 1 L of Sf21 cells
(Expression Systems) and incubated for 48 hrs at 27°C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation,
resuspended in wash buffer (25 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 5 mM DTT)
with 143 μl of BioLock per liter of culture. Cells were lysed via microfluidization
(Microfluidics). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation and filtration. The protein was purified
using Strep Tactin superflow agarose (IBA). Strep Tactin eluted protein was further purified by
size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 column (GE Life
Sciences) in 25 mM HEPES, 300 mM NaCl, 100 μM MgCl2, 2 mM TCEP, at pH 7.4. Pure
protein was concentrated by ultrafiltration prior to flash freezing in liquid nitrogen. SARS-CoV2 nsp7 and nsp8: The SARS-CoV-2 nsp7 and nsp8 genes were codon optimized and cloned
into pET46 (Novagen) with an N-terminal 6x histidine tag, an enterokinase site, and a TEV
protease site. Rosetta2 pLys E. coli cells (Novagen) were used for bacterial expression. After
induction with isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), cultures were grown at 16°C for
16 hrs. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and pellets were resuspended in wash buffer (10
mM Tris pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 30 mM imidazole, 2 mM DTT). Cells were lysed via
microfluidization and lysates were cleared by centrifugation and filtration. Proteins were
purified using Ni-NTA agarose beads and eluted with wash buffer containing 300 mM
imidazole. Eluted proteins were further purified by size exclusion chromatography using a
Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 column (GE Life Sciences). Purified proteins were concentrated
by ultrafiltration prior to flash freezing with liquid nitrogen.
Recombinant Protein Expression of RdRp (nsp12) and cofactors (nsp7 and nsp8) from SARSCoV-1
This protocol was described in Ref. 12. All SARS-CoV proteins used in this study were
expressed in Escherichia coli (E. coli), under the control of T5 promoters. Cofactors nsp7L8
and nsp8 alone were expressed from pQE30 vectors with C-terminal and N-terminal hexa19

Ampicillin (100 µM/mL) and Chloramphenicol (17 µg/mL). Protein expression was induced

purified first through affinity chromatography with HisPur Cobalt resin (Thermo Scientific),
with a lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM Imidazole,
supplemented with 20 mM MgSO4, 0.25 mg/mL Lysozyme, 10 µg/mL DNase, 1 mM PMSF,
with lysis buffer supplemented with 250 mM imidazole. Eluted protein was concentrated and
dialyzed overnight in the presence of histidine labeled TEV protease (1:10 w/w ratio to
TEV:protein) for removal of the protein tag. Cleaved protein was purified through a second
cobalt column and protein was purified through size exclusion chromatography (GE, Superdex
S200) in gel filtration buffer (25 mM HEPES pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 5mM MgCl2, 5 mM TCEP).
Concentrated aliquots of protein were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. A

with 1% CHAPS. Two additional wash steps were performed prior to elution, with buffer
supplemented with 20 mM imidazole and 50 mM arginine for the first and second washes
respectively. Polymerase was eluted using lysis buffer with 500 mM imidazole and

50% glycerol final concentration and stored at -20 °C.
Construct fabrication.
The fabrication of the RNA hairpin has been described in detail in Ref. 35. The RNA hairpin is
made of a 499 bp double-stranded RNA stem terminated by a 20 nt loop that is assembled from
three ssRNA annealed together (Extended data Fig. 1a), and two handles, one of 856 bp at the
5’ end and one 822 bp at the 3’ end. The handles include either an 343 nt digoxygenin-labeled
ssRNA or an 443 nt biotin-labeled ssRNA (Extended data Fig. 1a). Upon applied force above
~21 pN, the hairpin opens and frees a 1043 nt ssRNA template for SARS-CoV-2 replication
(Extended data Fig. 1b). To obtain the different parts of the RNA construct, template DNA
fragments were amplified via PCR, purified (Monarch PCR and DNA cleanup kit) and in vitro
transcribed (NEB HiScribe™ T7 High Yield RNA Synthesis Kit). Transcripts were then treated
with Antarctic Phosphatase and T4 Polynucleotide Kinase. RNAs were purified using the RNA
Clean & Concentrator-25 kit (Zymo Research). Individual RNA fragments were annealed and
ligated with T4 RNA ligase 2 (NEB) to assemble the RNA hairpin.

Flow cell assembly
The fabrication procedure for flow cells has been described in details in Ref. 34. To summarize,
we sandwiched a double layer of Parafilm by two #1 coverslips, the top one having one hole at
each end serving as inlet and outlet, the bottom one being coated with a 0.01% m/V
nitrocellulose in amyl acetate solution. The flow cell is mounted into a custom-built holder and
rinsed with ~1 ml of 1x phosphate buffered saline (PBS). 3 µm diameter polystyrene reference
beads are attached to the bottom coverslip surface by incubating 100 µl of a 1:1000 dilution in
PBS of (LB30, Sigma Aldrich, stock conc.: 1.828*1011 particles per milliliter) for ~3 minutes.
The tethering of the magnetic beads by the RNA hairpin construct relies on a digoxygenin/antidigoxygenin and biotin-streptavidin attachment at the coverslip surface and the magnetic bead,
respectively. Therefore, following a thorough rinsing of the flow cell with PBS, 50 µl of antidigoxigenin (50 µg/ml in PBS) is incubated for 30 minutes. The flow cell was flushed with 1
ml of 10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 750 mM NaCl, 2 mM sodium azide buffer to remove
excess of anti-digoxigenin followed by rinsing with another 0.5 ml of 1x TE buffer (10 mM
Tris, 1 mM EDTA pH 8.0 supplemented with 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM sodium azide). The surface
is then passivated by incubating bovine serum albumin (BSA, New England Biolabs, 10 mg/ml
in PBS and 50% glycerol) for 30 minutes, and rinsed with 1x TE buffer.
Single molecule RdRp replication activity experiments
20 µl of streptavidin coated Dynal Dynabeads M-270 streptavidin coated magnetic beads
(ThermoFisher) was mixed with ~0.1 ng of RNA hairpin (total volume 40 µl) and incubated
for ~5 minutes before rinsing with ~2 ml of 1x TE buffer to remove any unbound RNA and the
magnetic beads in excess. RNA tethers were sorted for functional hairpins by looking for the
characteristic jump in extension length due to the sudden opening of the hairpin during a force
ramp experiment 35 (Extended data Fig. 1b). The flow cell was subsequently rinsed with 0.5
ml reaction buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.9, 2 mM DTT, 2 µM EDTA, 5 mM MgCl2). After
starting the data acquisition at a force that would keep the hairpin open, 100 µl of reaction
buffer containing either 0.6 µM of nsp12, 1.8 µM of nsp7 and nsp8 for SARS-CoV-2
experiments or 0.1 µM of nsp12, 1 µM of nsp7 and nsp8 for SARS-CoV-1 experiments, the
indicated concentration of NTPs and of nucleotide analogues (if required) were flushed in the
flow cell to start the reaction. Sofosbuvir-TP and T-1106-TP were purchased from Jena
Bioscience (Jena, Germany) and 3’-dATP was purchased from TriLink Biotechnologies (San
Diego, CA, USA). The experiments were conducted at a constant force of 35 pN for a duration
of 20 to 40 minutes. The camera frame rate was fixed at either 58 Hz or 200 Hz, for reaction
temperature set at either 25°C or 37°C, respectively. A custom written Labview routine 36

controlled the data acquisition and the (x-, y-, z-) positions analysis/tracking of both the
magnetic and reference beads in real-time. Mechanical drift correction was performed by
subtracting the reference bead position to the magnetic beads positions.
Data processing
The replication activity of SARS-CoV-2 core replicase converts the tether from ssRNA to
dsRNA, which concomitantly decreases the end-to-end extension of the tether. The change in
extension measured in micron was subsequently converted into replicated nucleotides 𝑁𝑁𝑅𝑅 using
the following equation:
𝑁𝑁𝑅𝑅 (𝐹𝐹) = 𝑁𝑁 ∙

𝐿𝐿𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 (𝐹𝐹) − 𝐿𝐿𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 (𝐹𝐹)
𝐿𝐿𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 (𝐹𝐹) − 𝐿𝐿𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 (𝐹𝐹)

Where, 𝐿𝐿𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 (𝐹𝐹), 𝐿𝐿𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 (𝐹𝐹) and 𝐿𝐿𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 (𝐹𝐹) are the measured extension during the experiment, the
extension of a ssRNA and of a dsRNA construct, respectively, experiencing a force 𝐹𝐹, and 𝑁𝑁
the number of nucleotides of the ssRNA template 21. The traces were then filtered using a
Kaiser-Bessel low-pass filter with a cut-off frequency at 2 Hz. As previously described in Ref.
21
, a dwell time analysis was performed by scanning the filtered traces with non-overlapping
windows of 10 nt to measure the time (coined throughout the manuscript dwell time) for SARSCoV-2 replicase to incorporate ten successive nucleotides. The dwell times of all the traces for
a given experimental condition were assembled and further analyzed using a maximum
likelihood estimation (MLE) fitting routine to extract the parameters from the stochasticpausing model (see below).
SARS-CoV-2 replication product length analysis
To extract the product length of the replication complex, only the traces where the beginning
and the end could clearly be distinguished and for which the tether did not rupture for ten
minutes following the last observed replication activity were considered. We represented the
mean product length, as well as one standard deviation of the mean from 1000 bootstraps as
error bars.
Stochastic-pausing model
The model is described in detail in 20-22. There are many kinetic models that are consistent with
the empirical dwell-time distributions we observe, and we here work under the assumption that
the probability of pausing is low enough that there is only one rate-limiting pause in each dwelltime window. This assumption washes out most details of the kinetic scheme that connects
pauses and nucleotide addition, but allows us to determine the general form of the dwell-time
distribution without specifying how the pauses are connected to the nucleotide addition

In the above expression, the gamma function in the first term contributes the portion 𝑝𝑝𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛 of
dwell-times that originate in the RdRp crossing the dwell-time window of size 𝑁𝑁𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 base pairs
without pausing; the second term is a sum of contributions originating in pause-dominated
transitions, each contributing a fraction 𝑝𝑝𝑛𝑛 of dwell-times; the third term captures the
asymptotic power-law decay (amplitude 𝑎𝑎bt ) of the probability of dwell-times dominated by a
backtrack. The backtracked asymptotic term needs to be regularized for times shorter than the

diffusive backtrack step. We have introduced a regularization at 1 s, but the precise timescale
does not matter, as long as it is set within the region where the exponential pauses dominate
over the backtrack. From left to right, each term of Equation 1 is dominating the distribution
for successively longer dwell-times.
A cut-off factor 𝑄𝑄(𝑡𝑡) for short times is introduced to account for the fact that the dwell-time
window includes 𝑁𝑁𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 nucleotide-addition steps,
(𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛 ⁄𝑁𝑁𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 )𝑁𝑁𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 −1
𝑄𝑄(𝑡𝑡) =
.
1 + (𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛 ⁄𝑁𝑁𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 )𝑁𝑁𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 −1
The fit results dependence on these cut-offs is negligible as long as they are introduced in
regions where the corresponding term is sub-dominant. Here the cut is placed under the center
of the elongation peak, guaranteeing that it is placed where pausing is sub-dominant.
Maximum likelihood estimation. The normalized version of Equation 1 is the dwell-time
distribution fit to the experimentally collected dwell-times {𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖 }𝑖𝑖 by minimizing the likelihood

with respect to rates and probabilistic weights.

Dominating in a dwell-time window vs. dominating in one step. The fractions 𝑝𝑝𝑛𝑛 represent the
probability that a particular rate 𝑘𝑘𝑛𝑛 dominates the dwell-time. We want to relate this to the
probability 𝑃𝑃𝑛𝑛 that a specific exit rate dominates within a one-nt transcription window.
Assuming we have labelled the pauses so that 𝑘𝑘𝑛𝑛−1 > 𝑘𝑘𝑛𝑛 , we can relate the probability of
having rate 𝑛𝑛 dominating in 𝑁𝑁𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 steps to the probability of having it dominate in one step
through

The first term in Equation 3 represents the probability of having no pauses longer than the 𝑛𝑛𝑡𝑡ℎ
pause in the dwell-time window, and the second term represents the probability of having no
pauses longer than the (𝑛𝑛 − 1)𝑡𝑡ℎ pause. The difference between the two terms is the probability
that the 𝑛𝑛𝑡𝑡ℎ pause will dominate. This can be inverted to yield a relation between the singlestep probabilities (𝑃𝑃𝑛𝑛 ) and the dwell-time window probabilities (𝑝𝑝𝑛𝑛 )

This relationship has been used throughout the manuscript to relate our fits over a dwell-time
window to the single-step probabilities.
Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) fitting routine
The above stochastic-pausing model was fit to the dwell time distributions using a custom
Python 3.7 routine. Shortly, we implemented a combination of simulated annealing and bound
constrained minimization to find the parameters that minimize Equation 2. We calculated the
statistical error on the parameters by applying the MLE fitting procedure on 100 bootstraps of
the original data set 38, and reported the standard deviation for each fitting parameters.
Competition between obligatory terminator nucleotide analogues and their natural nucleotide
homologues
Starting with an empty active site (E), we assume that there is direct binding competition
between the natural nucleotide (N) and the nucleotide analogue terminator (T, simply coined
terminator) that result in either the former bound (Nb) or the latter bound (Tb) to the active site.

For a genome of length 𝐿𝐿, with the relative abundance 𝑞𝑞 of templating bases for N and T, we

Though the constructs are 1043 nucleotides long, this length is not always reached even when
there are no terminators in the buffer. The average product length is about 10% shorter than the
full construct length. To account for this reduction in maximal average product length, we
simply fix 𝐿𝐿 to be the mean product length reached without terminator in the buffer, and fit out
𝛾𝛾 from a least square fit, weighted with the inverse experimental variance.
