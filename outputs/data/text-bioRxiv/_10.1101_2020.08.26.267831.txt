Abstract
Numerous factors have been identified to influence susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection
and disease severity. Cancer patients are more prone to clinically evolve to more severe
COVID-19 conditions, but the determinants of such a more severe outcome remain largely
unknown. We have determined the full-length SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences of cancer
patients and healthcare workers (HCW; non-cancer controls) by deep sequencing and
investigated the within-host viral quasispecies of each infection, quantifying intrahost genetic
diversity. Naso- and oropharyngeal SARS-CoV-2+ swabs from 57 cancer patients and 14
healthcare workers (HCW) from the Brazilian Cancer Institute were collected in April–May
2020. Complete genome amplification using ARTIC network V3 multiplex primers was
performed followed by next-generation sequencing. Assemblies were conducted in Geneious
R11, where consensus sequences were extracted and intrahost single nucleotide variants
(iSNVs) were identified. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis was performed using
PhyMLv.3.0 and lineages were classified using Pangolin and CoV-GLUE. Phylogenetic
analysis showed that all but one strain belonged to clade B1.1. Four genetically linked
mutations known as the globally dominant SARS-CoV-2 haplotype (C241T, C3037T,
C14408T and A23403G) were found in the majority of consensus sequences. SNV signatures
of previously characterized Brazilian genomes were also observed in most samples. Another
85 SNVs were found at a lower frequency (1.4-19.7%). Cancer patients displayed a
significantly higher intrahost viral genetic diversity compared to HCW (p = 0.009). Intrahost
genetic diversity in cancer patients was independent of SARS-CoV-2 Ct values, and was not
associated with disease severity, use of corticosteroids, or use of antivirals, characteristics that
could influence viral diversity. Such a feature may explain, at least in part, the more adverse
outcomes to which cancer/COVID-19 patients experience.

Author Summary
Cancer patients are more prone to clinically evolve to more severe COVID-19 conditions, but
the determinants of such a more severe outcome remain largely unknown. In this study,
phylogenetic and variation analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from cancer patients and noncancer healthcare workers at the Brazilian National Cancer Institute were characterized by
deep sequencing. Viral genomes showed signatures characteristic of Brazilian viruses,
consistent with the hypothesis of local, community transmission rather than virus importation
from abroad. Despite most genomes in patients and healthcare workers belonging to the same
lineage, intrahost variability was higher in cancer patients when compared to non-cancer
counterparts. The intrahost genomic diversity analysis presented in our study highlights the
relaxed evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in a vulnerable population of cancer patients. The high
number of minor variations can result in the selection of immune escape variants, resistance
to potential drugs, and/or increased pathogenicity. The impact of this higher intrahost
variability over time warrants further investigation.

Introduction
In December 2019, a new form of pneumonia was described in patients with severe
acute respiratory syndrome in the city of Wuhan, province of Hubei, China [1]. Soon after, a
new beta-coronavirus was identified as the causative agent of that disease [2]. The new virus
was named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the
disease was called Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) [2]. Since its initial discovery,
COVID-19 has become a pandemic of catastrophic proportions, with over 17 million
confirmed

worldwide

(https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/, last accessed on July 30th, 2020).
Numerous demographic, clinical, genetic, and behavioral factors have been identified
to influence susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and, among those infected, the severity
of the disease, including the risk of death. Those factors include age, sex [3], genetic loci of
certain cytokines/chemokines and the ABO blood system group [4, 5], smoking history [6],
obesity and underlying comorbidities such diabetes, hypertension, lung diseases [7, 8], and
cancer [9-11]. Among cancer patients, those with malignancies of hematological origin have
been reported as particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 [12].
SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded RNA virus that replicates using an RNA-dependent
RNA polymerase. As such, the virus is subjected to high rates of nucleotide sequence
changes, and has evolved through molecular evolution and founder effects during its
explosive spread throughout the globe. Virus replication rates directly impact the
accumulation of mutations in the virus genome, enabling the existence of a viral quasispecies
(a swarm of different, yet highly related, viral entities) within an infected host. Although
within-host variations of SARS-CoV-2 have been documented [13, 14], the impact of
underlying comorbidities that promote persistent viral RNA detection and shedding on virus
evolution remains to be elucidated. Moreover, viral genetic variation, as a source of novel

mutations, may hinder future therapeutic antiviral and vaccine strategies targeting COVID-19,
by the selection of drug-resistant and vaccine escape mutants [15].
In the present work, we have determined the full-length SARS-CoV-2 genomic
sequences of 57 cancer patients and 14 healthcare workers (non-cancer controls) employing
next-generation sequencing (NGS), and analyzed their epidemiological relatedness and
lineage classification. This approach also allowed us to study the within-host viral
quasispecies of each infection, quantify intrahost viral genetic diversity and characterize
specific genetic changes with potential to impact the virus biology. Finally, we have also
assessed associations between viral diversity and patients’ clinical and laboratory
characteristics, thereby identifying determinant factors of viral evolution in this particular
group of patients.

Results
Clinical characteristics of the studied population
Summarized demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients and healthcare
workers from whom SARS-CoV-2 sequences were studied can be seen in Table 1. Among
patients, the median age was 61 years and most of them (72%) had solid malignancies, 16%
of patients used corticosteroids and 14% used oseltamivir previously or during COVID-19
diagnosis specimen collection. Among healthcare workers (HCW), the median age was 40
years and most (86%) were female. The most prevalent COVID-19 symptoms among patients
were cough, fever and dyspnea. Death from COVID-19 occurred in 33.3% of the cases. For
HCW, cough and coryza were the mainly reported COVID-19 symptoms (85.7% each), and
all subjects recovered from the disease, with no deaths reported. No difference was found in
sex distribution between the two groups (p = 0.118), but HCW had a lower median age when
compared to cancer patients (p < 0.001).

Sequence coverage, quality and metrics
A total of 27,433,528 reads were obtained from sequencing, with an average of
382,118 reads per sample, ranging from 217,922 to 631,796 reads. Reads of each sample were
assembled with Wuhan-Hu-1 reference genome with a minimum mapping quality of 30 Phred
and the average depth coverage obtained was 1,468 (465-2,530). The coverage was
heterogeneous across the genome but was similar among the samples (S1 Fig). Consensus
sequences containing more than 97.9% of the SARS-CoV-2 complete genome were generated
from all 57 cancer patient and 14 HCW samples.
Phylogenetic and epidemiological profile of SARS-CoV-2 sequences
SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence submission to the Pangolin and CoV-GLUE
algorithms resulted in the same lineage classification in all cases, defining all but one virus
belonging to clade B1.1, while the remaining sequence was classified as B.1. A phylogenetic
analysis of the viruses together with sequences previously defined as Brazilian circulating
strains B1.1-BR and B1.1-EU/BR showed that most B1.1 genomes generated in this study
clustered with B1.1-BR sequences (Fig 1A) [16]. A phylogenetic tree including all local
SARS-CoV-2 sequences isolated from patients residing in the state of Rio de Janeiro
available at the GISAID database (accessed on July 27th, 2020, S1 Table) was performed to
investigate potential epidemiological linkage between samples (Fig 1B). We noted that some
of the viruses sequenced at INCA clustered in clades containing identical sequences,
suggesting a transmission link between the study subjects. In some instances, both cancer
patients and HCW were involved in those epidemiological clusters. Although in some cases
sequences from outside the hospital were also identical to viruses from our series, therefore

not excluding the possibility of community transmission, the most likely scenario for those
cases is a nosocomial transmission between patients and/or HCW.
Single nucleotide variations across the SARS-CoV-2 genomes
Overall, 95 single nucleotide variations (SNVs) and three deletions were found across
the SARS-CoV-2 genomes analyzed (Fig 2). Four genetically linked mutations previously
described as the globally dominant haplotype in April 2020 were found in the majority of our
consensus sequences: C241T (100%; 5’UTR region), C3037T (98.6%; silent mutation),
C14408T (100%; resulting in P4715L/P323L amino acid change in ORF1ab) and A23403G
(100%; resulting in D614G amino acid change in S) [17]. Additionally, SNV signatures of
previously characterized Brazilian genomes were found in most samples, such as G28881A
and G28882A (98.6%; resulting in R203K change in N), G28883C (98.6%; resulting in
G204R change in N), T27299C (91.6%; resulting in I33T change in ORF6), and T29148C
(90.1%; resulting in I292T change in N) [16, 18]. The two latter SNVs are synapomorphic
traits of the B1.1-EU/BR and B1.1-BR Brazilian circulating strains [16]. Another 85 SNVs
were observed in our sequences in a lower frequency (1.4-19.7%; S2 Table), including nine
non-synonymous mutations in S protein (V16F, V367L, K558N, Q675H, A879V, S939F,
V1176F, K1191N and G1219V). Deletions were found in three genomes: a 12-bp in-frame
deletion in S (comprising positions 21603-21614), a 6-pb in-frame deletion in ORF3a (2571025715) and a 244-pb frameshift deletion in ORF7 (27508-27751), resulting in a truncated
protein. All deletions were confirmed by Sanger sequencing (data not shown).
SARS-CoV-2 intrahost genetic diversity
The next-generation sequencing method used for the study viruses allowed us to
assess the intrahost SNVs (iSNVs) that compose each subject’s viral quasispecies. The
number of iSNVs across the viral genome can be visualized in Figs 3A (patients) and 3B
(HCW). All but one iSNV with intrahost frequency greater than 20% were found exclusively
in cancer patients’ samples (Fig 4). Interestingly, patients displayed a significantly higher

intrahost viral genetic diversity when compared to HCW (p = 0.009; Fig 5A) and remained
significant even after outlier subjects with higher virus diversity were excluded from the
analysis (p = 0.029; Fig 5B). Viral genetic diversity within each ORF was compared between
the two groups, and cancer patients carried a higher genetic diversity in ORF 1A when
compared to non-cancer HCW (p = 0.045).
As the within-host genetic diversity of viruses is commonly associated with viral
replication, we have evaluated the correlation of the quasispecies diversity in our subjects
with the Ct values obtained in the RT-PCR swab tests of the same samples. Ct values work as
a proxy for SARS-CoV-2 viral load in samples and are expected to be inversely correlated
with viral diversity and replication. Surprisingly, however, Ct of the samples did not inversely
correlate with viral diversity, but rather showed a positive significant correlation, despite
having rs values below 0.5 (Fig 5). This was true for patients’ samples (rs = 0.490; p = 0.001;
Fig 6A) and also when all patients and HCW were analyzed together (rs = 0.478; p < 0.0001;
Fig 6B). Of note, no differences were found when Ct values were compared between the two
groups (p = 0.175). Despite the above mentioned age difference observed between HCW and
cancer patients, age did not correlate with viral genetic diversity (S2 Fig, p = 0.844).
Regarding patients' characteristics, intrahost virus diversity was not associated with
disease severity (overall death [p = 0.632] or death due to COVID-19 [p = 0.934], ICU
requirement [p = 0.612]), use of corticosteroids chronically or during COVID-19 course (p =
0.333), or use of oseltamivir prior to COVID-19 diagnosis (p = 0.144; S3A-E Fig). We also
assessed the potential association of cancer patients with hematological malignancies
compared to those with solid cancers, but no association was found (p = 0.473; S3F Fig).

Discussion
The biology of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans is striking to infectious disease
clinicians worldwide, because no viral infection has been previously seen with such an

enormous range of phenotypic outcomes, from no symptoms to severe respiratory distress and
death. Most of this physiological variance, however, has been attributed to host genetic and
behavioral factors. Numerous characteristics have been associated with susceptibility to
SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease severity among infected subjects, and underlying
comorbidities seem to play a major role in unfavorable disease outcomes. Chronic noncommunicable diseases such as cancer are among those conditions. Cancer patients have been
reported to be more prone to SARS-CoV-2 infection and to clinically evolve to more severe
conditions upon infection [9-11], but the determinants of these severe outcomes remain
largely unknown.
In this study we have evaluated the near full-length sequences of SARS-CoV-2infected cancer inpatients in one of the largest public cancer hospitals in South America, the
Brazilian National Cancer Institute, and compared these sequences with those generated from
healthcare professionals from the same institution. These complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes
showed signatures characteristic of the virus that spread globally and is currently the
predominant strain [17]. All but one virus also belonged to clade B1.1, which is the clade
primarily circulating in the Americas. The viral genomes also displayed sequence features of
other already characterized Brazilian viruses, consistent with the hypothesis of local,
community transmission rather than virus importation from abroad. In fact, the timeframe of
the analyzed infections (from April 7th to May 5th, 2020) is consistent with a period in Brazil
where community virus transmission was already established and ongoing [18]. Moreover, as
a public and free hospital in the Brazilian Public Health System, INCA is also likely to admit
patients with low socioeconomic resources who are mostly unable to travel abroad and most
likely acquired viral infections from local sources.
We explored the evolutionary and phylogenetic relationships between the SARS-CoV2 sequences of the studied samples. Upon a phylogenetic inference with viral sequences
isolated from other infected subjects residing in the state of Rio de Janeiro (the same

geographic location of the study site), we found that almost half of the sequences from our
subjects lie in clusters with sequences from other patients and/or from HCW. Some of the
consensus sequences within each cluster were identical, suggesting a direct epidemiological
link between those groups of patients/HCW. Some identical sequences retrieved from the
database representing subjects from the community outside the hospital were also identical to
some hospital-based sequences, ruling out the possibility of completely excluding
transmission from outside the hospital. However, the most parsimonious explanation is
nosocomial transmission in those cases. Indeed, the subjects’ samples were collected at a time
in Brazil when tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection were not easily accessible, and inpatients and
HCW had to wait several days for a test result, thus presenting a risk for further transmission.
Single nucleotide variations were found across the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome. The
spike (S) D614G mutation, found in all samples analyzed, has been associated with higher
viral titers, suggesting increased viral infectivity [17]. Other variations were also found in
different regions of the spike protein, including a 12-bp in-frame deletion that harbors part of
the signal peptide and the predicted cleavage site in the beginning of S. As expected, the
P323L change in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), genetically linked to D614G,
was also found in all our samples. In silico analysis showed that P323L may have an impact
on the protein secondary structure, leading to a reduction in its molecular flexibility [19].
However, the phenotypic impact of these mutations is still poorly understood. Numerous
other missense mutations were found that warrant further investigation concerning their
phenotypes.
The most striking observation of our intrahost quasispecies variation analysis was that
cancer patients carried significantly higher numbers of minor variants when compared to noncancer counterparts (Fig 5). This difference was independent of, and unrelated to the Ct
values obtained at the diagnostic tests, which did not differ between the two groups. Ct values
(as a proxy to viral load) not only did not inversely correlate with virus diversity, but indeed

showed a direct correlation, albeit with a low rs coefficient. It is well established that nasoand oropharyngeal swabs are not the best types of sample for detecting SARS-CoV-2,
compared to sputum for example, which contain a larger amount of viral genetic material
[20]. Our data underscore the possibility that the variation in the viral quasispecies that we see
is not generated in the naso- or oropharynx, but rather more distally in the respiratory tract
(lungs) or even in other tissues such as the gut. Reports on the comparative expression of the
virus’ cellular receptor ACE2 support the idea that those other tissues might be relevant
sources of viral replication and, consequently, sites where diversity emerges [21, 22].
Unexpectedly, the intrahost quasispecies variation observed in cancer patients was not
related to disease severity (requirement for ICU, death by any cause or COVID-19-related) or
to the use of corticosteroids (which could lower their immunity status). Diversity was neither
related to the use of oseltamivir, which was used by some patients to overcome a potential
H1N1 infection until the COVID-19 diagnosis was released. Finally, the genetic diversity was
not associated with the type of primary malignancy developed by the patient (solid tumor vs.
hematologic tumors). Despite conflicting data existing in the literature, the hematologic
cancer patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 herein analyzed did not show an increased chance
of COVID-19 severe outcomes when compared to those with solid tumors [23].
Despite the fact we do not know the mechanisms by which or the anatomical sites
where the SARS-CoV-2 quasispecies variation is generated in cancer patients, such increased
variation compared to non-cancer patients may explain, at least in part, the more adverse
outcomes to which cancer patients with COVID-19 are subjected to. By generating a higher
number of distinct variants, the virus can explore wider areas of the sequence landscape and
test variants with different regulatory and structural changes. Variation may impact tissue
tropism, protein expression and function, stability, immune escape, drug resistance and
pathogenicity. Further studies on SARS-CoV-2 diversity, especially in vulnerable patients

with underlying comorbidities will shed light on our understanding of the underlying wide
spectrum of disease outcomes associated with COVID-19 in humans.

Methods
Study population
Fifty-seven cancer patients followed at the Brazilian National Cancer Institute
(INCA), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and 14 healthcare workers (HCW) diagnosed with COVID-19
between April 7th and May 5th 2020, early in the COVID-19 pandemic in Rio de Janeiro, were
included in this study. SARS-CoV-2 infection was diagnosed through naso- and
oropharyngeal swab specimens using RT-qPCR following the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) protocol [24].
Ethics Statement
All participants agreed to be enrolled in the study and signed an informed consent.
Participants’ data were treated anonymously. This study was approved by the Brazilian
National Commission for Ethics in Research (CONEP) (approval number: CAAE
30608220.8.0000.5274).
SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid isolation, amplification and sequencing
Naso- and oropharyngeal swabs were collected and placed into a conical tube
containing 2 ml of viral transport medium (VTM, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA).
Viral DNA and RNA were extracted with the QIAamp MiniElute Virus Spin Kit (QIAGEN,
Chatsworth, CA) according to manufacturer's instructions. All cDNAs were synthesized in
duplicate using the SuperScript™ III First-Strand Synthesis System (Thermo Fisher
Scientific). The SARS-CoV-2 complete genome amplification was based on an openly
available protocol developed by the ARTIC network (https://artic.network/ncov-2019,
accessed March 26, 2020) using the V.3 multiplex primers scheme and Platinum Taq DNA
Polymerase High Fidelity (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Positive PCR products were purified
with the ReliaPrep™ DNA Clean-Up and Concentration System (Promega, Madison, WI).

Genomic libraries were constructed with the Nextera XT DNA Sample Preparation kit
(Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol, pooled with 1%
denatured PhiX DNA (sequencing control) and sequenced in a MiSeq platform (2× 251 cycles
paired-end run; Illumina). New PCR reactions using combinations of the primers described
above were carried out to cover regions with low coverage for each sample. Positive products
were purified and sequenced by Sanger using the BigDye Terminator kit (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) in an automated 3130XL Genetic Analyzer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Sequences
were edited and assembled with SeqMan v.7.0.0 (DNAStar Inc., Madison, WI).
SARS-CoV-2 near full-length consensus sequence and nucleotide variations
All analyses were conducted using Geneious R11 software (Biomatters, Auckland,
New Zealand), where the reads were trimmed to achieve an error rate below 0.1% and
assembled to the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference sequence genome (GenBank number MN908947). A
minimum mapping quality of 30 was required, providing a 99.9% confidence level that the
mapping is correct. Additionally, all assemblies were visually inspected to evaluate the
mapped reads and consequently to ensure the quality of the consensus generated and single
nucleotide variation (SNVs) analysis. Consensus sequences representing SARS-CoV-2 near
full-length genomes were extracted for each sample and aligned to the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference
sequence genome. Nucleotide variations in relation to the reference sequence were identified
and classified as SNVs. Intrahost single nucleotide variation (iSNV) was defined as a
variation with a frequency greater than 2% and depth coverage by at least 500 reads. iSNVs
were manually verified, and the intrahost viral genetic diversity rate was calculated as the
number of nucleotide substitutions with a frequency greater than 2% for the given sample
divided by the number of positions with depth coverage greater than 500 times multiplied by
10-4 (substitutions/site x 10-4).

For SARS-CoV-2 lineage classification, consensus genomes were submitted to
Pangolin software (https://github.com/cov-lineages/pangolin, downloaded on June 10th, 2020)
and to CoV-GLUE lineage system (http://cov-glue.cvr.gla.ac.uk/#/home, accessed on June
10th, 2020)[25], both based on the nomenclature proposed by Rambaut et al [26]. An
alignment including the consensus sequences generated and genomes from Brazilian
sequences available on the GISAID Database classified as B1, B1.1 and the Brazilian clusters
B1.1-BR/ B1.1-EU/BR (S1 Table) were submitted to a maximum likelihood phylogenic
reconstruction using PhyML v.3.0 and the best model of nucleotide substitution was defined
with Model Generator (GTR) to investigate the sublineage classification of the study
sequences [16, 27, 28]. Furthermore, a phylogenetic analysis that included the generated
consensus sequences generated along with all SARS-CoV-2 sequences from Rio de Janeiro
state (Brazil) presently available at GISAID (https://www.epicov.org/epi3/frontend, accessed
on July 27th, 2020, S1 Table) was performed in order to investigate epidemiological
relatedness of sequences.
Statistical analyses
Mann-Whitney

two-tailed

test

was

used

to

compare

intrahost

diversity

(substitutions/site x 10-4) between cancer patients and HCWs and between cancer patients’
clinical categorical variables. Spearman’s rank was employed to evaluate the correlation
between intrahost diversity and continuous variables (such as age and SARS-CoV-2 RTqPCR Ct values). All graphical representations and statistical analyses were performed using
Geneious R11 (Biomatters) and GraphPad Prism v.8.0.1 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego,
CA).
