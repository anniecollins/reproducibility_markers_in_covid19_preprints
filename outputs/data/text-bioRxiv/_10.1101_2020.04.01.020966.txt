Abstract
The current emergence of the novel coronavirus pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 demands
the development of new therapeutic strategies to prevent rapid progress of mortalities. The
coronavirus spike (S) protein, which facilitates viral attachment, entry and membrane fusion is
heavily glycosylated and plays a critical role in the elicitation of the host immune response. The
spike protein is comprised of two protein subunits (S1 and S2), which together possess 22
potential N-glycosylation sites. Herein, we report the glycosylation mapping on spike protein
subunits S1 and S2 expressed on human cells through high resolution mass spectrometry. We
have characterized the quantitative N-glycosylation profile on spike protein and interestingly,
observed unexpected O-glycosylation modifications on the receptor binding domain (RBD) of
spike protein subunit S1. Even though O-glycosylation has been predicted on the spike protein of
SARS-CoV-2, this is the first report of experimental data for both the site of O-glycosylation and
identity of the O-glycans attached on the subunit S1. Our data on the N- and O- glycosylation is
strengthened by extensive manual interpretation of each glycopeptide spectra in addition to using
bioinformatics tools to confirm the complexity of glycosylation in the spike protein. The elucidation
of the glycan repertoire on the spike protein provides insights into the viral binding studies and
more importantly, propels research towards the development of a suitable vaccine candidate.

Introduction
The current major health crisis is caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that rapidly spread globally within weeks in early 2020. This highly
transmissible infectious disease causes a respiratory illness named COVID-19 (Huang, C., Wang,
Y., et al. 2020, Wu, F., Zhao, S., et al. 2020). As of the 31st of March 2020, 750890 cases of
COVID-19 and 36405 COVID-19-related deaths have been confirmed globally by the World
Health Organization (WHO) (World Health Organization 2020b).
To date, no specific medical treatments or vaccines for COVID-19 have been approved (Li,
G.D. and De Clercq, E. 2020, World Health Organization 2020a). Therefore, the scientific
community is expending great effort in compiling data regarding the virus, as well as the
respiratory illness caused by it, to find effective ways of dealing with this health crisis.
The pathogenic SARS-CoV-2 enters human target cells via its viral transmembrane spike (S)
glycoprotein. The spike protein is a trimeric class I fusion protein and consists of two subunits,
namely S1 and S2. The S1 subunit facilitates the attachment of the virus, and subsequently the
S2 subunit allows for the fusion of the viral and human cellular membranes (Hoffmann, M., KleineWeber, H., et al. 2020, Walls, A.C., Park, Y.J., et al. 2020, Zhou, P., Yang, X.L., et al. 2020). The
entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2 has been identified as the human angiotensin-converting enzyme
2 (hACE2), and recent studies determined a high binding affinity to hACE2 (Hoffmann, M., KleineWeber, H., et al. 2020, Shang, J., Ye, G., et al. 2020, Walls, A.C., Park, Y.J., et al. 2020). Given
its literal key role, the S protein is one of the major targets for the development of specific medical
treatments or vaccines: neutralizing antibodies targeting the spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 could
prevent the virus from binding to the hACE2 entry receptor and therefore from entering the host
cell (Shang, J., Ye, G., et al. 2020).

Each monomer of the S protein is highly glycosylated with 22 predicted N-linked glycosylation
sites. Furthermore, four O-glycosylation sites were also predicted (Andersen, K.G., Rambaut, A.,
et al. 2020). Cryo-electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) provides evidence for the existence of 14–16
N-glycans on 22 potential sites in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein (Walls, A.C., Park, Y.J., et al. 2020).
The glycosylation pattern of the spike protein is a crucial characteristic to be considered regarding
steric hindrance, chemical properties and even as a potential target for mutation in the future. The
N-glycans on S protein play important roles in proper protein folding and priming by host
proteases. Since glycans can shield the amino acid residues and other epitopes from cells and
antibody recognition, glycosylation can enable the coronavirus to evade both the innate and
adaptive immune responses (Walls, A.C., Park, Y.J., et al. 2020, Walls, A.C., Xiong, X., et al.
2019). Elucidating the glycosylation of the viral S protein can aid in understanding viral binding
with receptors, fusion, entry, replication and also in designing suitable antigens for vaccine
development (Chakraborti, S., Prabakaran, P., et al. 2005, Watanabe, Y., Bowden, T.A., et al.
2019, Zheng, J., Yamada, Y., et al. 2018). Strategies for vaccine development aim to elicit such
adaptive immunity through an antibody response at the sites of viral entry (Afrough, B., Dowall,
S., et al. 2019).
Here, we report the site-specific quantitative N-linked and O-linked glycan profiling on SARSCoV-2 subunit S1 and S2 protein through glycoproteomics using high resolution LC-MS/MS. We
used recombinant SARS-CoV-2 subunit S1 and S2 expressed in human cells, HEK 293, and
observed partial N-glycan occupancy on 17 out of 22 N-glycosylation sites. We found that the
remaining five N-glycosylation sites were unoccupied. Remarkably, we have unambiguously
identified 2 unexpected O-glycosylation sites at the receptor binding domain (RBD) of subunit S1.
O-glycosylation on the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is predicted in several recent reports and
most of these predictions are for sites in proximity to furin cleavage site (S1/S2) as similar sites
are O-glycosylated in SARS-CoV-1 (Andersen, K.G., Rambaut, A., et al. 2020). However, we

observed O-glycosylation at two sites on the RBD of spike protein subunit S1, and this is the first
report on the evidence for such glycan modification at a crucial viral attachment location. Sitespecific analysis of N- and O- glycosylation information of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein provides
basic understanding of the viral structure, crucial for the identification of immunogens for vaccine
design. This in turn has the potential of leading to future therapeutic intervention or prevention of
COVID-19.

Results
Studies over the past two decades have shown that glycosylation on the protein antigens can
play crucial roles in the adaptive immune response. Thus, it is obvious that the glycosylation on
the protein antigen is relevant for the development of vaccines, and it is widely accepted that the
lack of information about the glycosylation sites hampers the design of such vaccines (Wolfert,
M.A. and Boons, G.J. 2013).
Mapping N-glycosylation on SARS-CoV-2 spike protein
We have procured culture supernatants of HEK 293 cells expressing SARS-CoV-2 subunit 1
and subunit 2 separately. The proteins were expressed with a His tag with Val16 to Gln690 for
subunit 1 and Met697 to Pro1213 for subunit 2. According to manufacturers, SDS-PAGE of the
proteins showed a higher molecular weight than the predicted 75 and 60 kDa, respectively, due
to glycosylation. Since the proteins were unpurified, we fractionated them through SDS-PAGE on
separate lanes and cut the bands corresponding to subunit 1 and subunit 2. The gels were stained
with Coomassie dye, and gel bands were cut into small pieces, de-stained, reduced, alkylated
and subjected to in-gel protease digestion. We employed trypsin, chymotrypsin, and both trypsinchymotrypsin in combination to generate glycopeptides that contain a single N-linked glycan site.
The glycopeptides were further analyzed by high resolution LC-MS/MS, using a glycan oxonium

ion product dependent HCD triggered CID program. The LC-MS/MS data were analyzed using
Byonic software, each detected spectrum was manually validated and false detections eliminated.
We identified the glycan compositions at 17 out of the 22 predicted N-glycosylation sites of
the SARS-CoV-2 S1 and S2 proteins and found the remaining five sites unoccupied (Figure 2, 3).
We observed both high mannose and complex-type glycans across the N-glycosylation sites but
found no hybrid type N-glycans. We quantified the relative intensities of glycans at each site by
comparing the area under the curve of each glycopeptide peak on the LC-MS chromatogram. A
recent preprint investigated the N-glycosylation on SARS-CoV-2 and reported prevalence of
hybrid-type glycans (Watanabe, Y., Allen, J.D., et al. 2020). In contrast, we observed a
combination of high mannose and complex-type, but no hybrid-type glycans on most of the sites.
We discovered predominantly highly processed sialylated complex-type glycans on sites N165,
N282, N801, and N1098 (Figure 3, 4). The highly sialylated glycans at N234 and N282, which are
at the RBD can act as determinant in viral binding with hACE2 receptors (Hoffmann, M., KleineWeber, H., et al. 2020, Tortorici, M.A., Walls, A.C., et al. 2019, Walls, A.C., Park, Y.J., et al. 2020).
Similar to one recent report, we observed Man5GlcNAc2 as a predominant structure across all
sites (Watanabe, Y., Allen, J.D., et al. 2020). However, we observed significantly unoccupied
peptides on both S1 and S2 subunits. Sites N17, N603, N1134, N1158 and N1173 were
completely unoccupied, although further studies with higher concentration and purity of proteins
are required to validate this finding (Figure 1, 2). On subunit S2, the detection of N-glycosylation
at sites N709, N717, and N1134 was ambiguous as the quality of the MS/MS spectra was not
satisfactory and we are currently evaluating the possibilities of other post translational
modifications adjacent to these sites.
Identification of O-Glycosylation on SARS-CoV-2 spike protein
We have evalulated O-glycosylation on the S1 and S2 subunits of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein
by searching LC-MS/MS data for common O-glycosylation modifications. Interestingly, our O6

glycoproteomic profiling indicated O-glycosylation at sites Thr323 and Ser325 on the S1 subunit
of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (Figure 5, 6). Since O-glycosylation at Thr323 and Ser325 on the
spike protein has not been reported before and is not indicated based on cryo-electron
microscopy data of SARS-CoV-2 S protein, we evaluated the detected O-glycopeptide manually
(Walls, A.C., Park, Y.J., et al. 2020). We observed very strong evidence for the presence of Oglycosylation at site Thr323 as b and y ions of the peptide

neutral losses and the detection of oxonium ions also confirmed the presence of glycosylation on

confirmed unambiguously as Electron Transfer Dissociation (ETD) fragmentation on this peptide

Heiss, C., et al. 2017).

Discussion
Two very recent preprints reporting N-glycosylation on spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 showed
different glycosylation profiles, and both reports were different from our results although all three
studies utilized recombinant S protein from an HEK 293-based expression system (Watanabe,
Y., Allen, J.D., et al. 2020, Zhang, Y., Zhao, W., et al. 2020). This indicates the caution to be
exercised in determining the glycosylation on viral antigens generated from various sources as

the changes in glycosylation pattern can influence the efficacy of potential vaccine candidates
(Chang, D. and Zaia, J. 2019).
O-glycans, which are involved in protein stability and function, have been observed on some
viral proteins and have been suggested to play roles in the biological activity of viral proteins
(Andersen, K.G., Rambaut, A., et al. 2020, Bagdonaite, I. and Wandall, H.H. 2018). A comparative
study of human SARS-CoV-2 S protein with other coronavirus S proteins has shown that Ser673,
Thr678, and Ser686 are conserved O-glycosylation locations, and SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein was
suggested to be O-glycosylated at these locations (Andersen, K.G., Rambaut, A., et al. 2020).
Although it is unclear what function these predicted O-linked glycans perform, they have been
suggested to create a ‘mucin-like domain’ which could shield SARS-CoV-2 spike protein epitopes
or key residues (Bagdonaite, I. and Wandall, H.H. 2018). Since some viruses can utilize mucinlike domains as glycan shields for immunoevasion, researchers have highlighted the importance
of experimental studies for the determination of predicted O-linked glycosylation sites (Andersen,
K.G., Rambaut, A., et al. 2020, Bagdonaite, I. and Wandall, H.H. 2018). We evaluated the Oglycosylation site prediction using the widely accepted tool Net-O-Gly server 4.0 (Steentoft, C.,
Vakhrushev, S.Y., et al. 2013). However, the tool did not find any strong prediction for the Oglycosylation except for the sites Ser673, Thr678 and Ser686.
Our analysis confirmed the presence of O-glycosylation at Thr323 and indicated possible
glycosylation at Ser325 (Figure 5, 6). Intriguingly, the possible O-glycosylation at Thr323 of
SARS-CoV-2 subunit 1 glycoprotein has been predicted by computational analysis in a very
recent preprint report (Uslupehlivan, M. and Sener, E. 2020). The accuracy of our observation of
O-glycosylation at Thr323 is further confirmed by the presence of proline at location 322,
considering the well-established fact that the frequency of occurrence of proline residues is higher
adjacent to O-glycosylation sites (Thanka Christlet, T.H. and Veluraja, K. 2001). Cryo-EM studies
on SARS-CoV-2 indicate that the binding of S protein to the hACE2 receptor primarily involves

extensive polar residue interactions between RBD and the peptidase domain of hACE2
(Hoffmann, M., Kleine-Weber, H., et al. 2020, Walls, A.C., Park, Y.J., et al. 2020). The S protein
RBD located in the S1 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 undergoes a hinge-like dynamic movement to
enhance the capture of the receptor RBD with hACE2, displaying 10–20-fold higher affinity for the
human ACE2 receptor than SARS-CoV-1, which partially explains the higher transmissibility of
the new virus (Wrapp, D., Wang, N., et al. 2020, Yan, R., Zhang, Y., et al. 2020). The residues
Thr323 and Ser325 are located at the RBD of the S1 subunit of SARS-Cov-2, and thus the Oglycosylation at this location could play a critical role in viral binding with hACE2 receptors
(Andersen, K.G., Rambaut, A., et al. 2020, Hoffmann, M., Kleine-Weber, H., et al. 2020). Our
observation will pave the way for future studies to understand the implication of O-glycosylation
at the RBD of S1 protein in viral attachment with hACE2 receptors.
Our comprehensive N- and O-glycosylation characterization of SARS-CoV-2 expressed in a
human cell system provides insights into site-specific N- and O- glycan decoration on the trimeric
spike protein. We have employed an extensive manual interpretation strategy for the assignment
of each glycopeptide structure in order to eliminate possibilities of ambiguous software based
annotation. We are currently working on elucidating other potential post-translational
modifications on SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as understanding the protein modifications in detail
is important to guide future researches on disease interventions involving spike protein. Detailed
glycan analysis is important for the development of glycoprotein-based vaccine candidates as a
means to correlate the structural variation with immunogenicity. Glycosylation can serve as a
measure to evaluate antigen quality as various expression systems and production processes are
employed in vaccine manufacture. The understanding of complex sialylated N-glycans and
sialylated mucin type O-glycans, particularly in the RBD domain of the spike protein of SARSCoV-2, provides basic knowledge useful for elucidating the viral infection pathology in future

therapeutic possibilities, as well as in the design of suitable immunogens for vaccine
development.

Materials and methods
Dithiothreitol (DTT) and iodoacetamide (IAA) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis,
MO). Sequencing-grade modified trypsin and chymotrypsin were purchased from Promega
(Madison, WI). All other reagents were purchased from Sigma Aldrich unless indicated otherwise.
Data analysis was performed using Byonic 3.5 software and manually using Xcalibur 4.2. The
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein subunit 1 (Cat No. 230-20407) and subunit 2 (Cat No. 230-20408)
were purchased from RayBiotech (Atlanta, GA).
Protease digestion and extraction of peptides from SDS-PAGE
The protein subunits S1 and S2 as HEK 293 culture supernatants were fractionated on
separate lanes using SDS-PAGE. The gel was stained by Coomassie dye and the bands
corresponding to subunit 1 (200 to 100 kDa) and subunit 2 (150 to 80 kDa) were cut into smaller
pieces (1 mm squares approx.) and transferred to clean tubes. The gel pieces were de-stained
by adding 100 µL acetonitrile (ACN): 50mM NH4HCO3 (1:1) and incubated at room temperature
(RT) for about 30 min. Tubes were centrifuged, the supernatant was discarded, and 100 µL ACN
was added before incubation for 30 min. The proteins on gel pieces were reduced by adding 350
µL 25 mM DTT and incubating at 60 °C for 30 min. The tubes were cooled to RT and the
supernatant removed. The gels were washed with 500 µL of ACN, 350 µL 90 mM IAA was added,
and the mixture was incubated at RT for 20 min in the dark. Proteins were digested by adding
sequence-grade trypsin and/or chymotrypsin (we performed digests with both enzymes
individually and as a cocktail) in digestion buffer (50 mM NH4HCO3) for 18 h at 37 °C separately.
The peptides were extracted out from the gel by addition of 1:2 H2O:ACN containing 5% formic

acid (500 µL), and the released peptides were speed-dried. The samples were reconstituted in
aqueous 0.1% formic acid for LC-MS/MS experiments.
Data acquisition of protein digest samples using nano-LC-MS/MS
The glycoprotein digests were analyzed on an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer
equipped with a nanospray ion source and connected to a Dionex binary solvent system
(Waltham, MA). Pre-packed nano-LC columns of 15 cm length with 75 µm internal diameter (id),
filled with 3 µm C18 material (reverse phase) were used for chromatographic separation of
samples. The precursor ion scan was acquired at 120,000 resolution in the Orbitrap analyzer and
precursors at a time frame of 3 s were selected for subsequent MS/MS fragmentation in the
Orbitrap analyzer at 15,000 resolution. The LC-MS/MS runs of each digest were conducted for
both 72 min and 180 min in order to separate the glycopeptides. The threshold for triggering an
MS/MS event was set to 1000 counts, and monoisotopic precursor selection was enabled. MS/MS
fragmentation was conducted with stepped HCD (Higher-energy Collisional Dissociation) product
triggered CID (Collision-Induced Dissociation) (HCDpdCID) program. Charge state screening was
enabled, and precursors with unknown charge state or a charge state of +1 were excluded
(positive ion mode). Dynamic exclusion was enabled (exclusion duration of 30 secs).
Data analysis of glycoproteins
The LC-MS/MS spectra of tryptic, chymotryptic and combined tryptic /chymotryptic digests of
glycoproteins were searched against the .fasta sequence of spike protein S1 and S2 subunit using
the Byonic software by choosing appropriate peptide cleavage sites (semi-specific cleavage
option enabled). Oxidation of methionine, deamidation of asparagine and glutamine, possible
common human N-glycans and O-glycan masses were used as variable modifications. The LCMS/MS spectra were also analyzed manually for the glycopeptides with the support of the Xcalibur
software. The HCDpdCID MS2 spectra of glycopeptides were evaluated for the glycan neutral loss

Figure 1: The SARS-Cov-2 spike proteins recombinatly expressed on HEK293 supernatant were
fractionated through SDA-PAGE, subsequently digested by proteases anc analyzed by nLC-NSIMS/MS. The expression of SARS-Cov-2 spike protein subunits S1 and S2 on HEK 293 culture
supernatant showed higher molecular weight upon SDS-PAGE than expected, because of
glycosylation. Thus, the gel bands corresponding to the molecular weight of 200 kDa to 100 kDa
for S1 and 150 kDa to 80 kDa for S2 were cut, proteins were lysed after reduction-alkylation and
analyzed by LC-MS/MS (created with biorender.com).
Figure 2: Glycosylation profile on coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 characterized by high-resolution LCMS/MS. About 17 N-glycosylation sites were found occupied out of 22 potential sites along with
two O-glycosylation sites bearing core-1 type O-glycans. Some N-glycosylation sites were
partially glycosylated.
