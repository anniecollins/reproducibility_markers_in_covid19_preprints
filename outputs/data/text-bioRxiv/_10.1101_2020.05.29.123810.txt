Abstract

41
42

In December 2019 an outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) emerged in

43

Wuhan, China. The causative agent was subsequently identified and named severe

44

acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which rapidly spread

45

worldwide causing a pandemic.

46

therapeutics available against SARS-CoV-2 but numerous candidate vaccines are in

47

development and repurposed drugs are being tested in the clinic. There is a vital need

48

for authentic COVID-19 animal models to further our understanding of pathogenesis

49

and viral spread in addition to pre-clinical evaluation of candidate interventions.

Currently there are no licensed vaccines or

50
51

Here we report a dose titration study of SARS-CoV-2 to determine the most suitable

52

infectious dose to use in the ferret model. We show that a high (5x106 pfu) and medium

53

(5x104 pfu) dose of SARS-CoV-2 induces consistent upper respiratory tract (URT) viral

54

RNA shedding in both groups of six challenged animals, whilst a low dose (5x102 pfu)

55

resulted in only one of six displaying signs of URT viral RNA replication. The URT

56

shedding lasted up to 21 days in the high dose animals with intermittent positive signal

57

from day 14. Sequential culls revealed distinct pathological signs of mild multifocal

58

bronchopneumonia in approximately 5-15% of the lung, observed on day 3 in high and

59

medium dosed animals, with presence of mild broncho-interstitial pneumonia on day

60

7 onwards. No obvious elevated temperature or signs of coughing or dyspnoea were

61

observed although animals did present with a consistent post-viral fatigue lasting from

62

day 9-14 in the medium and high dose groups. After virus shedding ceased, re-

63

challenged ferrets were shown to be fully protected from acute lung pathology. The

64

endpoints of URT viral RNA replication in addition to distinct lung pathology and post

65

viral fatigue were observed most consistently in the high dose group. This ferret model

66

of SARS-CoV-2 infection presents a mild clinical disease (as displayed by 80% of

67

patients infected with SARS-CoV-2). In addition, intermittent viral shedding on days

68

14-21 parallel observations reported in a minority of clinical cases.

Introduction

74
75

Coronaviruses are positive sense, single stranded RNA viruses belonging to the family

76

Coronaviridae1. These viruses can infect a range of animals, including humans and

77

usually cause a mild respiratory infection, much like the common cold. Two highly

78

pathogenic coronaviruses have emerged in the human population in the last 20 years;

79

severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) CoV and middle eastern respiratory

80

syndrome (MERS) CoV. SARS-CoV infected approximately 8,000 people worldwide with

81

a case fatality rate (CFR) of 10%, while MERS-CoV has infected approximately 2,500

82

people with a CFR of 36% 2.

83
84

In December 2019 several pneumonia cases of unknown cause emerged in Wuhan,

85

Hubei, China. Deep sequencing analysis from lower respiratory tract samples from

86

patients indicated the cause to be a novel coronavirus3. The causative agent of this

87

novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was identified as SARS-CoV-2. As of May

88

22nd 2020, there have been over 4,893,000 confirmed cases reported worldwide,

89

including over 323,000 deaths, in over 180 countries4. The global mortality rate is yet

90

to be determined. Approximately 80% of patients display only mild symptoms, with

91

approximately 14% displaying severe symptoms such as dyspnoea and low blood

92

oxygen saturation. Around 6% of cases become critical, with respiratory failure, septic

93

shock and/or multiple organ failure5.

animal models to evaluate antivirals or vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2.

96

Ferrets have been used extensively to model the disease caused by influenza virus6-

97

12

98

virus18,19. Due to the presence of ACE2, the virus receptor, on cells of the ferret

99

respiratory tract, these animals were developed an as effective model for SARS-

100

CoV20-23. The ferret has been shown to shed detectable virus from its URT as well as

101

exhibiting comparable clinical symptoms associated with milder cases of the

102

infection21 and shown similar pathology in the lung to that observed in humans22.

103

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein has been shown to exhibit many similarities in its amino

104

acid sequence and protein structure to the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV24

105

and also utilises ACE2 for cell entry 25, suggesting ferrets would be a potential model

106

for COVID-19.

infection as well as human RSV13,14, mumps virus15, Ebola virus16,17 and Nipah

107
108

To understand if ferrets are a suitable model for SARS-CoV-2 infection we challenged

109

animals intranasally with a range of titres of SARS-CoV-2 (5x102, 5x104 and 5x106

110

pfu) in 1ml volume. The purpose was to characterise the most suitable challenge dose

111

for use in future studies, to aid understanding of the kinetics of viral pathogenesis and

112

the immune response following infection and to facilitate the evaluation of treatments

113

and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.

119

Study Design. Ferrets were challenged intranasally with 1ml of Victoria/1/202026

120

SARS-CoV-2 at three different titres representing a high, medium and low dose (Table

121

1). A high titre stock of challenge virus was prepared (passage 3), and quality control

122

sequencing showed it was identical to the original stock received from the Doherty

123

Institute and did not contain a commonly reported 8 amino acid deletion in the furin

124

cleavage site27. Following the initial challenge, a re-challenge with the high dose

125

(5x106 PFU) took place at day 28 post challenge (pc). The four (two per group)

126

remaining ferrets in groups 2 and 3 were re-challenged via the same, intranasal, route

127

and 1ml volume alongside a control group of two naïve control ferrets (group 5).

128
129

Viral Shedding following challenge. Viral RNA was detected in the nasal wash of

130

6/6 ferrets in the high dose group from day 1 pc and continued to be detected at

131

varying levels until day 20 pc (Fig. 1a). The peak in viral RNA shedding was seen

132

between day 2 and 4 pc for all ferrets in the high dose group. Following a decline in

133

viral RNA (2/2 animals) to below the limit of quantification at day 13 pc, an increase

134

was seen at days 16 and 18, with a measurement in viral RNA for one ferret (4.75x104

135

copies/ml) just above the limit of quantification at day 16 pc and a viral load of 1.1x106

136

copies/ml in the other ferret at day 18 pc. Both Group 1 survivors were euthanised on

137

day 21 at which point no viral RNA was detected in their nasal washes.

139

In the medium dose group 6/6 ferrets also had detectable viral RNA in nasal washes

140

from day 1 pc. The peak of viral RNA shedding was more variable in the medium dose

141

group, with some ferrets peaking at days 2 to 3 pc (4/6) and others peaking at days 5

142

to 6 pc (2/6). A decline was then seen until day 11 pc where viral RNA levels fell below

143

the limit of quantification, but viral RNA was still detected. By day 16 no more viral

144

RNA was detected. Quantifiable viral RNA was only found in the nasal wash of 1/6

145

ferrets in the low challenge dose group. This ferret was euthanised on day 5 pc. No

146

other ferrets in the low dose group were found to shed quantifiable viral RNA in their

147

nasal wash.

148
149

A similar trend in the titre of viral RNA detected in nasal wash samples was observed

150

in the throat swabs samples during the first week after challenge (Fig. 1b). The

151

amount of viral RNA detected in the throat swab samples of ferrets in the high dose

152

group (6/6) peaked at day 3 pc. In contrast, however, detection of viral RNA in throat

153

swab samples was less prolonged than in the nasal passage, with no quantifiable viral

154

RNA detected past day 11 pc.

155
156

Detection of viral RNA in the rectal swabs was found to be variable across the different

157

dose groups (Fig 1c.). The highest viral RNA load was observed in a ferret in the high

158

dose group but there was a less consistent pattern of RNA detection which did not

159

continue past day 7 pc. In the medium dose group, 4/6 ferrets were found to have

160

detectable viral RNA in their rectal swabs between day 2 and 8 pc. No viral RNA was

161

detected in any of the rectal swabs collected from the low dose group following

162

challenge.

163
164

Viral RNA was detected at quantifiable levels in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of

165

each ferret euthanised (scheduled) on day 3 pc from the high dose (1/1) and medium

166

dose (1/1) groups (Fig. 1d). Viral RNA was detected but not quantified for ferrets

167

across all three challenge groups at day 5 and 7 pc. There was no viral RNA detected

168

in the BAL of any of the other ferrets after scheduled euthanasia. No viral RNA was

169

detected in the blood of ferrets from any group taken, as scheduled, on days 2, 5, 8,

170

11 and 14 pc (data not shown).

171
172

Illumina sequencing of nasal wash RNA extracts showed little variation between the

173

genome isolated at days 5 and 6 and the original sequence of the virus inoculated into

174

the ferrets. Only one non-synonymous SNP was identified, in the day five pc for a

175

ferret from the medium dose group; a T2152I mutation within the orf1ab polyprotein,

176

no further timepoints were collected for this animal as it was euthanised at day 5 pc.

177
178

Clinical signs. The normalised summed incidence of clinical scores for each group of

179

ferrets is shown in Fig 2a and total summed scores are shown in Table 2. At day 9 pc

180

all 3/3 ferrets in the high dose group showed reduced activity, a similar observation

181

was made in the medium dose group but later on day 10 pc. Reduced activity was

182

accompanied by ruffled fur, a sign that the ferrets were not grooming regularly. By

183

day 13 pc ferrets in the medium dose group stopped showing signs of reduced activity

184

and by day 15 pc the high dose groups stopped showing signs of reduced activity.

185

Ferrets in the high dose group had the highest normalised cumulative clinical score

186

(summed across all time points) (14.01), followed by the medium dose group (6.99)

187

with sporadic instances recorded in the low dose group. No fever (> 39.9°C) was

188

detected in any ferret, in any group (Fig. 2b); instead body temperature remained

189

within the normal range. No weight loss was observed in any ferret in any group, below

190

baseline; however, the SARS-CoV-2 infected ferrets failed to gain as much weight as

191

the ferrets in the control (PBS) group, although this difference was not statistically

192

significant (Fig. 2c).

193
194

Histopathology. The nasal cavity from high dose ferrets showed a minimal to mild

195

necrosis of epithelial cells (Fig. 3a) from days 3 to 7 pc. However, abundant epithelial

196

cells from the nasal cavity were stained for viral RNA at day 3 pc (Fig. 3b). Occasional

197

scattered cells expressing viral RNA were observed in high dose animals at days 5

198

and 7 pc and medium dose animals at days 3, 5 and 7 pc. Similarly, very few scattered

199

epithelial cells were stained for viral RNA in the trachea and larynx from high and

200

medium dose animals at day 3, 5 and 7 pc.

201
202

No remarkable gross lesions were observed in the infected animals. Upon histological

203

examination of the lungs of ferrets from the high and medium dose groups, a mild

204

multifocal bronchopneumonia from day 3 to 14 pc was observed. Mild necrosis of the

205

bronchiolar epithelial cells was observed together with inflammatory cell infiltration of

206

neutrophils and mononuclear cells within the bronchiolar luminae, mostly affecting

207

animals from the high dose group at day 3, 5 and 7 pc (Fig. 3c). This

208

bronchopneumonia was characterised by the infiltration of inflammatory cells, mostly

209

neutrophils, but also macrophages and lymphocytes, in approximately 10-15% of the

210

lung section at day 3 pc decreasing to less than 5% at days 5 and 7 pc. The medium

211

dose group showed mild bronchopneumonia in less than 5% of the lung sections at

212

days 3 and 5 pc, while only occasional infiltration was observed in animals from the

213

low dose group. Few cells stained positive for viral RNA using in situ hybridisation

214

(RNAScope). Few type I and occasionally type II pneumocytes and alveolar

215

macrophages were positive for viral RNA at days 3, 5 and 7 pc (Fig. 3d) in high and

216

middle dose animals. Occasionally, mild proliferation of BALT was observed

217

surrounding damaged bronchi and bronchioles at the early stages of the disease, with

218

slightly more severity at day 14 and 21 pc (high dose) (Fig. 3e). Mild interstitial

219

pneumonia with an increase in the thickness of the interalveolar septa was observed

220

from day 3 pc towards the end of the experiment in high and medium dose groups

221

(Fig. 3e). Ferrets from the high dose group showed mild proliferation of type II

222

pneumocytes from day 7 pc onwards.

223
224

The liver showed multiple foci of inflammatory cell infiltration in the portal areas,

225

composed of mainly macrophages, lymphocytes and occasional plasma cells (Fig. 3f).

226

This multifocal infiltration was more severe in animals from the high and medium dose

227

groups from day 3 pc, compared to the low dose group or control (PBS) animals, which

228

only showed minimal presence of portal inflammation. No other remarkable changes

229

were observed in any other tissue. However, occasional positive cells (absorbing

230

epithelial enterocytes and goblet cells) were also observed in the small and large

231

intestine from high and medium dose at days 3, 5 and 7 pc.

235

longitudinally following challenge as illustrated in Table 3. The average fold increase

236

of neutralising antibodies from day 8 pc to day 14 pc was about the same for both the

237

high and medium dose groups.

238

neutralising antibodies throughout the time course. One naïve sentinel group ferret

239

was shown to have strong neutralising antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 upon euthanasia at

240

day 20 pc. This ferret showed no clinical signs of SARS-CoV-2 infection and samples

241

takes at baseline, day 11 and day 20 post challenge were shown to be PCR negative

242

for SARS-CoV-2.

243

tissues taken from both naïve sentinel ferrets euthanised on day 20 pc. Interestingly,

244

the cellular immune response seen in lung mononucleocytes (MNCs) (data not shown)

245

of the naïve sentinel ferret showed a high SARS-CoV-2 specific immune response to

246

whole live SARS-CoV-2, paralleling the high neutralising antibodies seen in the plaque

247

reduction neutralisation test for this ferret.

The low dose group had comparatively low

Further there was no evidence for any pathology in any of the

248
249
250

Re-challenge of ferrets with high dose SARS-Cov-2 results in absence of lung

251

pathology. Four previously infected ferrets, two from the medium and low dose

252

challenge groups, had neutralising titres of 1:274, 1:250, 1:82, and 1:55 at day 26 post

253

challenge respectively, see Table 3. At day 28 pc, these ferrets and two naïve control

254

animals were challenged intranasally with the high dose of SARS-Cov-2 (5x106 pfu).

255

Though URT infection was similar in all groups on day 2 post re-challenge (day 30 pc

256

for Groups 1-3), viral RNA levels subsequently decreased in the previously challenged

257

animals (n=4), with the medium dose group showing rapid decrease to below

258

quantifiable levels by day 5 post re-challenge (day 33 pc). Viral RNA levels continued

259

to stay above quantifiable levels in the naïve control group, although they began to fall

260

at day 8 post re-challenge (Fig. 4a). Similar results were seen in the throat swab and

261

rectal swabs (data not shown), with reduced viral shedding seen in the re-challenged

262

animals. Animals in the re-challenged medium and low dose groups exhibited weight

263

loss from baseline that was not seen at initial challenge for any of the animals in any

264

of the challenge groups (Fig. 4b). Re-challenged animals also experienced increased

265

clinical observations of lethargy and ruffled fur that was not observed at such an early

266

stage in the initial challenge (Table 2). In contrast, the two previously naïve control

267

animals did not experience weight loss below baseline after infection and they did not

268

suffer the same level of clinical observation as the re-challenged animals (Fig 4b).

269
270

The cellular immune response in the lungs of a low dose (Group 2) re-challenge ferret

271

and a naïve control (Group 5) ferret at day 36 (8 days post re-challenge respectively)

272

were compared. Fig. 4c shows SARS-CoV-2 specific cellular immune responses, as

273

determined by IFN-γ ELISpot.

274

stimulation of lung MNCs with peptide pools spanning the spike protein varied between

275

ferrets from each group. The strongest response is detected in the re-challenge ferret

276

after ex-vivo re-stimulation with whole live virus. Upon histological examination the

277

upper and lower respiratory tracts from animals in both re-challenged groups showed

278

no remarkable lesions (Fig. 4d and 4e), and no presence of the significant

279

bronchopneumonia that was observed in ferrets challenged with 5x106 pfu for the first

280

time, i.e. the original high dose ferret or the naïve control infected group included for

281

the ‘re-challenge' (Fig. 4f). This parallels the absence of pathology observed in the

282

two naïve sentinel ferrets euthanised at day 20 pc.

Discussion

285
286

This study demonstrated that ferrets are susceptible to experimental intranasal

287

infection with a low passage isolate of SARS-CoV-2 strain Victoria 1. A high dose

288

(5x106 pfu/ml in a 1ml volume) intranasal challenge in ferrets produced mild clinical

289

signs, consistent lung pathology and a viral shedding pattern that aligns with the mild

290

to moderate disease seen in the human population.

291
292

Previously published SARS-CoV-1 challenge studies conducted in the ferret show that

293

a lower dose of that virus (103 TCID50) is sufficient to cause a mild disease in the ferret

294

20,21.

295

intranasal challenge resulted in an infection characterised by prolonged viral RNA

296

shedding in all ferrets (days 1 -11 pc), accompanied by observable clinical signs from

297

day 8 post challenge for both high and medium dose groups.

298

symptoms were delayed by approximately 24 hours in the medium dose animals. Both

299

doses also induced classical pathology of bronchial pneumonia involving 10% and 3%

300

of recipient lungs respectively. A low dose intranasal challenge of the same SARS-

301

CoV-2 virus (5x102 pfu) appeared to result in infection of only one ferret which shed

302

viral RNA in the upper respiratory tract and failed to show any remarkable lesions in

303

the respiratory tract.

Here it was shown that a high (5x106 pfu) and medium (5x104 pfu) dose

305

In the high and medium dose groups, virus was readily detected using in-situ

hybridisation in the upper respiratory tract of ferrets, with a peak at 3 days post

307

challenge. These findings aligned with the detected shedding of viral RNA from nasal

308

washes which also peaked at day 3 to 4 post challenge. This upper respiratory

309

infection mirrors the clinical disease recently reported in mild cases of humans infected

310

with SARS-CoV-2 infection28.

311
312

Recent reports indicate that COVID-19 patients appear to shed viral RNA intermittently

313

after recovery from disease with some individuals being tested and found to be positive

314

again after being released from isolation29. This report is in alignment with the

315

observations in the two ferrets challenged with the high dose of SARS-CoV-2

316

(euthanised at day 21) which appeared to continue to shed detectable viral RNA from

317

the upper respiratory tract up to day 18 post challenge even though these animals had

318

developed neutralising antibodies.

319
320

The main histopathological finding in approximately 10% of the lung tissue sections in

321

the high dose group consisted mainly of a multifocal bronchiolitis, with inflammatory

322

infiltrates within the airways and some alveolar species. This finding is similar, but less

323

severe, to the findings in the published reports about SARS-CoV-1 ferret challenge

324

models22,30,31. In this study, mild alveolar damage was observed in the acute phase.

325

At later time points, mild proliferation of type II pneumocytes, with interstitial infiltrates

326

and peribronchiolar cuffing, was recoded, consistent with evolution form the acute

327

phase.

328
329

Mild to moderate multifocal hepatic inflammatory cell infiltration has been widely

330

reported in viral infections in animals, and has been previously described in SARS-

331

CoV-1 infected ferrets32. However, the periportal infiltrates may not be associated with

332

injury to the surrounding tissue and they are reported as a common background finding

333

in laboratory ferret species. The presence of infected enterocytes has been reported

334

for SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 in humans33 and different ferret models34,35 .

335
336

The upper respiratory virus replication, reported here, in the high and medium dose

337

groups of animals, support the observations of Shi et al. 34 who challenged ferrets with

338

105 pfu of SARS-CoV-2 and found peak levels of viral RNA (108 copies/ml) in nasal

339

washes on day 6. They also reported mild lung pathology associated with SARS-CoV-

340

2 infection similar to our medium dose animals, but this was not as extensive as that

341

seen in our high dose challenge group ferrets.

342
343

A ferret model of SARS-CoV-2 infection has also been developed by Kim et al.35 who

344

used a challenge of 3x105 pfu which resulted in peak URT viral RNA shedding on day

345

4-6 which coincided with a significant temperature spike. In the present study, animals

346

challenged with either 5x104 or 5x106 pfu displayed a consistent fatigue after peak viral

347

shedding, however a significant increase in body temperature was not observed. This

348

fatigue after peak of viral shedding was not observed in the low dose group, ruling out

349

the possibility of it being induced by an aspect of ferret handling, such as sedation or

350

sampling.

351
352

Both Shi et al.34 and Kim et al.35 report live virus isolation from RNA positive nasal

353

wash samples. In this study, only low levels of live virus in some nasal washes and

354

throat swabs were detected even though high levels of viral RNA were detected. A

355

possible reason for this observation could be poor stability of this virus isolate, which

356

is currently untested, resulting in a knockdown of live virus between taking the samples

357

from a ferret and assaying the material. There may also have been an inhibitory effect

358

from the sample matrix in the cell cultures used for the live virus plaque assay.

359

Alternatively, this result may have accurately reflected low levels of viable virus

360

presence which others have reported even though viral RNA can be detected. For

361

human swabs and sputum samples, it has been noted that infectious virus was never

362

recovered from samples with a viral RNA load of less than 106 copies/ml28.

363
364

Neutralising antibody levels developed in ferrets in all challenge groups within 14 days,

365

even though some animals in the low dose group were found to have no detectable

366

viral RNA shedding. The finding that low and medium dosed animals showed reduced

367

viral RNA shedding in the URT and an absence of lung pathology following re-

368

challenge is encouraging; it suggests that there may be potential benefits for the

369

healthy population as a result of naturally acquired immunity and is in line with the

observation reported by Bao et al.

in which previously infected rhesus macaques

372
373

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-specific immune responses seen in a low dose re-

374

challenged ferret were compared to that of a primary challenge ferret. This comparison

375

showed that the response to the virus appears to be higher on re-challenge.

376

However, ferrets challenged with our high dose of SARS-CoV-2 displayed increased

377

clinical observations and lost weight from baseline following re-challenge, hinting at

378

enhanced disease but a larger study would be required to effectively assess this

379

observation. Alternatively, these clinical signs may be perfectly normal host response

380

to infection in a pre-immune individual whilst the immune system is successfully

381

clearing a large challenge dose.

382
383

This study demonstrated that ferrets challenged with 5x106 pfu or 5x104 pfu displayed

384

only mild clinical signs of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These signs appeared to be less

385

severe than those reported after ferrets were infected with SARS-CoV-121,30.

386
387

This ferret model of intranasal SARS-CoV-2 infection presents three key measurable

388

endpoints: a) consistent URT viral RNA shedding; b) significant lung pathology; and

389

c) post viral fatigue. Reductions in URT RNA shedding during the first 14 days post

390

intranasal challenge could be an attractive indicator of the efficacy of candidate

391

therapeutics and vaccines. It may be wise, however, to euthanise prior to 14 days

392

post challenge to more accurately assess the impact on lung pathology especially

393

when looking for signs of vaccine-enhanced disease20,37,38. Alternatively, if CT

394

scanning facilities were available, this may be achieved without the need to euthanise

395

a cohort if this technology was found suitable to also make this assessment. We

396

believe the high dose intranasal challenge will provide the most distinct disease

397

endpoints. However, with its reduced level of lung pathology, the medium dose

398

challenge may provide a higher level of sensitivity to some interventions, as was

399

observed when assessing therapeutics to influenza in the ferret model39.

Viruses and Cells. SARS-CoV-2 Victoria/01/202026 was generously provided by The

404

Doherty Institute, Melbourne, Australia at P1 and passaged twice in Vero/hSLAM cells

405

[ECACC 04091501] Whole genome sequencing was performed, on the challenge

406

isolate, using both Nanopore and Illumina as described previously40. Virus titre was

407

determined by plaque assay on Vero/E6 cells [ECACC 85020206]. Cell lines were

408

obtained from the European Collection of Authenticated Cell Cultures (ECACC) PHE,

409

Porton Down, UK. Cell cultures were maintained at 37oC in MEM (Life Technologies,

410

California, USA) supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (Sigma, Dorset, UK) and

411

25 mM HEPES (Life Technologies).

412
413

Animals. Twenty-two healthy, female ferrets (Mustela putorius furo) ages 7 months

414

were obtained from a UK Home Office accredited supplier (Highgate Farm, UK). The

415

mean weight at the time of challenge was 1032g/ferret (range 870-1239g). Animals

416

were housed in pairs at Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens (ACDP)

417

containment level 3. Cages met with the UK Home Office Code of Practice for the

418

Housing and Care of Animals Bred, Supplied or Used for Scientific Procedures

419

(December 2014). Access to food and water was ad libitum and environmental

420

enrichment was provided. All experimental work was conducted under the authority of

421

a UK Home Office approved project licence that had been subject to local ethical

422

review at PHE Porton Down by the Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body (AWERB)

423

as required by the Home Office Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986.

425

Experimental Design. Before the start of the experiment animals were randomly

426

assigned to challenge groups, to minimise bias. The weight distribution of the animals

427

was tested to ensure there was no statistically significant difference between groups

428

(one-way ANOVA, p > 0.05). An identifier chip (Bio-Thermo Identichip, Animalcare Ltd,

429

UK) was inserted subcutaneously into the dorsal cervical region of each animal. Prior

430

to challenge animals were sedated by intramuscular injection of ketamine/xylazine

431

(17.9 mg/kg and 3.6 mg/kg bodyweight). Challenge virus was delivered by intranasal

432

instillation (1.0 ml total, 0.5 ml per nostril) diluted in phosphate buffered saline (PBS).

433
434

Three different doses of virus were delivered to three groups (n=6) of ferrets: high

435

[5x106 pfu/ml], medium [5x104 pfu/ml] and a low [5x102 pfu/ml] dose. For the high,

436

medium and low dose groups, individual ferrets were scheduled for euthanasia on day

437

3 (n=1), day 5 (n=1), day 7 (n=1) and day 14 (n=1). For the high dose group, the

438

remaining 2 ferrets were euthanised on day 21 (n=2). The mock-infected animals (n=2)

439

received an intranasal instillation of sterile PBS and were euthanised on day 20.

440
441

On day 28 pc the remaining ferrets in the low (n=2) and medium (n=2) groups were

442

re-challenged with 5x106 pfu by the intranasal route. Additional naïve control ferrets

443

(n=2) were also challenged on day 28, to provide a re-challenge control. All 6 animals

444

were monitored for clinical signs and one ferret from each group was euthanised on

445

day 33 and the remaining animals were euthanised on day 36.

446
447

Nasal washes, throat and rectal swabs were taken at days -1, 1-8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16,

448

18 and 20 pc. They were also taken at days 1-5 and 8 post re challenge (days 29-33

449

and 36 pc). Whole blood and serum were collected at 2, 5, 8, 11, 14 days pc for all

450

ferrets. Whole blood and serum were collected at days 2, 5 and 8 (days 30, 33 and 36

451

pc) post re-challenge for all remaining ferrets. The negative control ferrets (n=2) had

452

nasal washes, throat swabs, whole blood and serum taken at -1 and 11 days pc. At

453

necropsy nasal washes, throat and rectal swabs, whole blood and serum were taken

454

alongside tissue samples for histopathology. Nasal washes were obtained by flushing

455

the nasal cavity with 2 ml PBS. For throat swabs, a flocked swab (MWE Medical Wire,

456

Corsham, UK) was gently stroked across the back of the pharynx in the tonsillar area.

457

Throat and rectal swabs were processed, and aliquots stored in viral transport media

458

(VTM) and AVL at -80C until assay.

459
460

Clinical and euthanasia observations. Animals were monitored for clinical signs of

461

disease four times daily (approximately 6 hours apart) for the first 5 days pc and then

462

twice daily (approximately 8 hours apart) for the remaining time. Clinical signs of

463

disease were assigned a score based upon the following criteria. Activity was scored

464

as follows; 0 = alert and playful, 1 = alert, playful when stimulated, 2 = alert, not playful

465

when stimulated, 3 = not alert or playful. Ruffled fur was given a score of 1. No other

466

clinical signs were noted. In order to meet the requirement of the project license,

467

immobility, neurological signs or a sudden drop in temperature were automatic

468

euthanasia criteria. Animals were also deemed to have reached a humane endpoint

469

if their body weight was at or below 30% baseline. If any ferret reached any of these

470

three euthanasia criteria, they were to be immediately euthanised using a UK Home

471

Office approved Schedule 1 procedure. However, no animals reached these end-

472

points during this study.

474

Temperature was taken using a microchip reader and implanted temperature/ID chip.

475

Temperature was recorded at each clinical scoring point using the chip to ensure any

476

peak of fever was recorded. Animals were weighed at the same time of each day from

481

puncture, followed by injection of an anaesthetic overdose (sodium pentabarbitone

samples to neutralise the virus. The neutralised virus was transferred into the wells of

525

a washed plaque assay 24-well plate (see plaque assay method), allowed to adsorb

526

at 37°C for a further hour, and overlaid with plaque assay overlay media. After 5 days

527

incubation at 37°C in a humified box, the plates were fixed, stained and plaques

Histopathological Analysis. Samples from the left cranial and left caudal lung lobe

532

together with spleen, kidney, liver, tracheobronchial and axillary lymph nodes,

533

jejunum, colon, trachea, larynx and nasal cavity, were fixed by immersion in 10%

534

neutral-buffered formalin and processed routinely into paraffin wax. Nasal cavity

535

samples were decalcified using an EDTA-based solution prior to embedding. 4 µm

536

sections were cut and stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and examined

537

microscopically. In addition, samples were stained using the RNAscope technique to

538

identify the SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA. Briefly, tissues were pre-treated with hydrogen

539

peroxide for 10 minutes (room temperature), target retrieval for 15 mins (98-101°C)

540

and protease plus for 30 mins (40°C) (Advanced Cell Diagnostics). A V-nCoV2019-S

541

probe (Cat No. 848561, Advanced Cell Diagnostics) was incubated on the tissues for

542

2 hours at 40°C. Amplification of the signal was carried out following the RNAscope

543

protocol using the RNAscope 2.5 HD Detection kit – Red (Advanced Cell Diagnostics).

Isolation of Lung Mononuclear Cells. Whole lungs were removed from each

547

ferret. The lungs were dissected into small pieces and placed into a 12.5ml solution

548

of collagenase (715 collagenase units/ml) (Sigma-Aldrich) and DNase (350 DNase

549

units/ml) (Sigma-Aldrich). Lungs were placed into gentleMACS C-tubes and agitated

550

whilst incubating at 100rpm, 37oC for 1 hour on an OctoMACS (Miltenyi Biotec, Surrey,

551

UK). Partially digested lung tissue was then dissociated using an OctoMACS. The

552

tissue solution was passed through two cell sieves (100µm then 70µm) and then

553

layered with Ficoll®- Paque Premium (GE Healthcare, Hatfield, United Kingdom).

554

Density gradient centrifugation was carried out at 400g for 30 minutes. Buffy coats

555

containing lymphocytes were collected and washed with medium by pelleting cells via

556

centrifugation at 400 g for 10 minutes. The cells were counted using a vial-1 cassette

557

and a Nucleocounter-200 before cryopreservation in 95% FCS/ 5% v/v DMSO.

consisted of 15mer peptides overlapping by 11mers. Individual peptides were

573

reconstituted in 10% v/v DMSO. The 10 peptide pools, each containing 32 peptides,

574

were created by combining equimolar amounts of each peptide. Three mega pools

575

spanning the whole spike protein (approx. 100 peptides in each mega pool) were also

576

created. Each peptide pool and mega pool was diluted for use in the ELISpot assay in

MNCs. The virus was cell culture grown and was a direct match to the isolate used

580

for ferret challenge. R10 media was used as a negative control and for preparation

581

and dilution of cells, peptide, virus and stimulants.

582

(PMA/Ionomycin 500x concentrate, Sigma-Aldrich, Dorset, United Kingdom), was

583

used as a positive control to prove cells were capable of a stimulation response. Pre-

584

coated ferret anti- IFN-γ ELISpot plates (mAb MTF14, Mab-tech, Nacka. Sweden)

585

were used and 500,000 lung MNCs were plated per well in 50µl of R10, with or without

586

antigen, in duplicate and incubated overnight (37°C, 5% CO2). Following cell

587

stimulation, plates were washed 5x with 1x PBS (Gibco) and incubated at RT for 2

588

hours with biotinylated anti IFN-γ IgG. The plates were then washed 5x with 1x PBS

589

and incubated with streptavidin-ALP for 1 hour, RT. The plates were washed again

590

5x with 1x PBS and spots were developed with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoly phosphate

591

(BCIP)-Nitro Blue tetrazolium (NBT) substrate. Plates were allowed to dry overnight

592

and decontaminated by formaldehyde fumigation before removal from the CL3 facility.

593

Plates were read, counted and quality control checked using the CTL ELISpot plate

The table illustrates the summed scores for each clinical observation noted for each

774

of the groups during specific days post challenge and post re-challenge. Activity in

775

ferrets was scored as follows; 0 = alert and playful, 1 = alert, playful when stimulated,

776

2 = alert, not playful when stimulated, 3 = not alert or playful. Ruffled fur was given a

777

score of 1. Activity scores of 1 were given to ferrets during the initial challenge. Upon

778

re-challenge ferret activity was recorded as 1 or 2 indicating increased lethargy in

779
