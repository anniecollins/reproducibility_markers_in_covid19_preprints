ABSTRACT
Origin of the COVID-19 virus has been intensely debated in the scientific community since the first infected cases were
detected in December 2019. The disease has caused a global pandemic, leading to deaths of thousands of people across
the world and thus finding origin of this novel coronavirus is important in responding and controlling the pandemic.
Recent research results suggest that bats or pangolins might be the original hosts for the virus based on comparative
studies using its genomic sequences. This paper investigates the COVID-19 virus origin by using artificial intelligence
(AI) and raw genomic sequences of the virus. More than 300 genome sequences of COVID-19 infected cases collected
from different countries are explored and analysed using unsupervised clustering methods. The results obtained from
various AI-enabled experiments using clustering algorithms demonstrate that all examined COVID-19 virus genomes
belong to a cluster that also contains bat and pangolin coronavirus genomes. This provides evidences strongly supporting
scientific hypotheses that bats and pangolins are probable hosts for the COVID-19 virus. At the whole genome analysis
level, our findings also indicate that bats are more likely the hosts for the COVID-19 virus than pangolins.

INTRODUCTION
The COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly spread across many countries and disturbed lives of millions of people around
the globe. There have been approximately 10 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 globally, including nearly 500,000
deaths, reported to the World Health Organization at the end of June 2020 [1]. Studies on understanding the virus,
which was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), are important to propose appropriate
intervention strategies and contribute to the development of therapeutics and vaccines. Finding origin of the COVID19 virus is crucial as it helps to understand where the virus comes from via its evolutionary relationships with other
biological organisms and species. This will facilitate the process of identifying and isolating the source and preventing
further transmissions of the pathogen to the human population. This will also help to understand the outbreak dynamics,
leading to the creation of informed plans for public health responses [2].
A study by Wu et al. [3] using a complete genome obtained from a patient who was a worker at a seafood market
in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China shows that the virus is closely related to a group of SARS-like CoVs that were
previously found present in bats in China. It is believed that bats are the most likely reservoir hosts for the COVID-19
virus as it is very similar to a bat coronavirus. These results are supported by a separate study by Lu et al. [4] using
genome sequences acquired from nine COVID-19 patients who were among early cases in Wuhan, China. Outcomes
of a phylogenetic analysis suggest that the virus belongs to the genus Betacoronavirus, sub-genus Sarbecovirus, which
includes many bat SARS-like CoVs and SARS CoVs. Another study in [5] confirms this finding by analysing genomes
obtained from three adult patients admitted to a hospital in Wuhan on December 27, 2019. Likewise, Zhou et al. [6]
advocate a probable bat origin of SARS-CoV-2 by using complete genome sequences of five patients at the beginning of
the outbreak in Wuhan, China. One of these sequences shows 96.2% similarity to a genome sequence of a coronavirus,

denoted RaTG13, which was previously obtained from a Rhinolophus affinis bat found in Yunnan province of China.
Zhang and Holmes [7] also highlight a similarity of approximately 85% between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 in their
receptor binding domain, which is an important region of the viral genomes for binding the viruses to the human
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor.
In another study, Lam et al. [8] found two related lineages of CoVs in pangolin genome sequences sampled in Guangxi
and Guangdong provinces in China, which have similar genomic organizations to SARS-CoV-2. That study suggests
that pangolins could be possible hosts for SARS-CoV-2 although they are solitary animals in an endangered status with
relatively small population sizes. These findings are corroborated by Zhang et al. [9] who assembled a pangolin CoV
draft genome using a reference-guided scaffolding approach based on contigs taxonomically annotated to SARS-CoV-2,
SARS-CoV, and bat SARS-like CoV. Xiao et al. [10] furthermore suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may have been formed by a
recombination of a pangolin CoV-like virus with one similar to RaTG13, and pangolins are potentially the intermediate
hosts for SARS-CoV-2. On the other hand, by analysing genomic features of SARS-CoV-2, i.e. mutations in the receptor
binding domain portion of the spike protein and distinct backbone of the virus, Andersen et al. [11] determined that this
novel coronavirus originated through natural processes rather than through a laboratory manipulation.
This study presents a step further to suggesting the likely origin of the COVID-19 virus by using artificial intelligence
(AI) methods to explore genome sequences obtained from more than 300 COVID-19 patients across the world. We use
AI-enabled unsupervised clustering methods to demonstrate and emphasize the relationships between COVID-19 virus,
bat CoVs and pangolin CoVs. Through analysing the results of clustering methods, we are able to suggest the sub-genus
Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus of SARS-CoV-2 and the more likely bat origin of the virus rather than a
pangolin origin.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
We downloaded 334 complete genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 available from the GenBank database, which is
maintained by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), in early April 2020. Among these sequences,
258 were reported from USA, 49 were from China and the rest were distributed through various countries from Asia to
Europe and South America. Accession numbers and detailed distribution of these genome sequences across different
countries are presented in Tables 4 and 5 in Appendix 1.
Most of reference sequences, e.g. ones within the Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus genera, are also downloaded
from the NCBI GenBank and Virus-Host DB (https://www.genome.jp/virushostdb/) that covers NCBI Reference Sequences (RefSeq, release 99, March 2, 2020). Genome sequences of Guangxi pangolin CoVs [8] are downloaded
from the GISAID database (https://www.gisaid.org) with accession numbers EPI_ISL_410538 - EPI_ISL_410543. A
Guangdong pangolin CoV genome [10] is also downloaded from GISAID with accession number EPI_ISL_410721. We
employ three sets of reference sequences in this study with details presented in Tables 1-3. The selection of reference
genomes at different taxonomic levels is based on a study in [12] that uses the AI-based supervised decision tree method
to classify novel pathogens, which include SARS-CoV-2 sequences. We aim to traverse from high to low taxonomic
levels to search for the COVID-19 virus origin through discovering its genus and sub-genus taxonomy and its closest
genome sequences.
Unsupervised clustering methods are employed to cluster datasets comprising both query sequences (SARS-CoV-2) and
reference sequences into clusters. In this paper, we propose the use of hierarchical clustering algorithm [13] and densitybased spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) method [14] for this purpose. With these two methods, we
perform two steps to observe the clustering results that lead to interpretations about the taxonomy and origin of SARSCoV-2. In the first step, we apply clustering algorithms to cluster the set of reference sequences only, and then use the
same settings (i.e. values of parameters) of clustering algorithms to cluster a dataset that merges reference sequences
and SARS-CoV-2 sequences. Through this step, we can find out reference sequences by which SARS-CoV-2 sequences
form a group with. In the second step, we vary the settings of the clustering algorithms and observe changes in the

clustering outcomes. With the second step, we are able to discover the closest reference sequences to the SARS-CoV-2
sequences and compare the similarities between genomes.
In the hierarchical clustering method, the cut-off parameter C plays as a threshold in defining clusters and thus C is
allowed to change during our experiments. With regard to the DBSCAN method, the neighbourhood search radius
parameter ε and the minimum number of neighbours parameter, which is required to identify a core point, are crucial
in partitioning observations into clusters. In our experiments, we set the minimum number of neighbours to 3 and
allow only the search radius parameter ε to vary. Outputs of the DBSCAN method may also include outliers, which are
normally labelled as cluster “-1”. To facilitate the execution of the clustering methods, we propose the use of pairwise
distances between sequences based on the Jukes-Cantor method [15] and the maximum composite likelihood method
[16]. The Jukes-Cantor method estimates evolutionary distances by the maximum likelihood approach using the number
of substitutions between two sequences. With nucleotide sequences, the distance is defined as d = −3/4∗ln(1−p∗4/3)
where p is the ratio between the number of positions where the substitution is to a different nucleotide and the number
of positions in the sequences. On the other hand, the maximum composite likelihood method considers the sum of loglikelihoods of all pairwise distances in a distance matrix as a composite likelihood because these distances are correlated
owing to their phylogenetic relationships. Tamura et al. [16] showed that estimates of pairwise distances and their
related substitution parameters such as those of the Tamura-Nei model [17] can be obtained accurately and efficiently by
maximizing this composite likelihood. The unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) method is
applied to create hierarchical cluster trees, which are used to construct dendrogram plots for the hierarchical clustering
method. The UPGMA method is also employed to generate phylogenetic trees in order to show results of the DBSCAN
algorithm.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
We start the experiments to search for taxonomy and origin of SARS-CoV-2 with the first set of reference genome sequences (Set 1 in Table 1). This set consists of much more diversified viruses than the other two sets (Sets 2 and 3 in
Tables 2 and 3) as it includes representatives from major virus classes at the highest available virus taxonomic level.
With a large coverage of various types of viruses, the use of this reference set minimizes the probability of missing out
any known virus types. Outcomes of the hierarchical clustering and DBSCAN methods are presented in Figs. 1 and 2,
respectively. In these experiments, we use 16 SARS-CoV-2 sequences representing 16 countries in Table 5 (Appendix
1) for the demonstration purpose. The first released SARS-CoV-2 genome of each country is selected for these experiments. Clustering outcomes on all 334 sequences are presented in Fig. 9 in Appendix 2, which shows results similar to
those reported here. Both clustering methods consistently demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 sequences form a cluster with a
representative virus of Riboviria among 12 major virus classes (Adenoviridae, Anelloviridae, Caudovirales, Geminiviridae, Genomoviridae, Microviridae, Ortervirales, Papillomaviridae, Parvoviridae, Polydnaviridae, Polyomaviridae, and

Riboviria). The Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) CoV, which caused the MERS outbreak in 2012, is chosen
as a representative of the Riboviria realm. In hierarchical clustering (Fig. 1), when combined with reference genomes,
SARS-CoV-2 genomes do not create a new cluster on their own but form a cluster with the MERS CoV, i.e. cluster “8”.
With the DBSCAN method (Fig. 2), SARS-CoV-2 genomes also do not create their own cluster but form the cluster “1”
with the MERS CoV. These clustering results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the Riboviria realm.

Fig. 1. Dendrogram plots showing hierarchical clustering results using only the reference sequences in Set 1 (Table 1) with the cut-off parameter C
equal to 5 ∗ 10−4 (left), and using a set that merges 16 representative SARS-CoV-2 sequences and reference sequences with C also set to 5 ∗ 10−4
(right). A number at the beginning of each virus name indicates the cluster that virus belongs to after clustering.

Once we have been able to identify SARS-CoV-2 as belonging to the Riboviria realm, we move to the next lower taxonomic level that consists of 12 virus families within Riboviria. These families are presented in Set 2 (Table 2) that
includes Betaflexiviridae, Bromoviridae, Caliciviridae, Coronaviridae, Flaviviridae, Peribunyaviridae, Phenuiviridae,
Picornaviridae, Potyviridae, Reoviridae, Rhabdoviridae, and Secoviridae. Results of the two clustering methods presented in Figs. 3 and 4 show that SARS-CoV-2 sequences form a group with viruses in the Coronaviridae family. As
we also include in Set 2 representatives of four genera in the Coronaviridae family (i.e. Alphacoronavirus - AlphaCoV,

Betacoronavirus - BetaCoV, Deltacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus), we are able to look further to the next taxonomic
level within this experiment and observe that SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the Betacoronavirus genus (see Figs. 3 and 4).
There are 5 sub-genera in the Betacoronavirus genus, including Embecovirus, Nobecovirus, Merbecovirus, Hibecovirus,
Sarbecovirus. In the next lower taxonomic level, we investigate which of these sub-genera that SARS-CoV-2 belongs
to or whether SARS-CoV-2 genomes create a new cluster on their own. We use Set 3 (Table 3) that includes 37
reference sequences for this investigation. Six representatives of the Alphacoronavirus genus, which is proximal to the
Betacoronavirus genus, are also included in Set 3. The rest of Set 3 comprises 2 viruses of the Embecovirus sub-genus,
2 viruses of the Nobecovirus sub-genus, 3 viruses of the Merbecovirus sub-genus, 1 virus of the Hibecovirus sub-genus
and 23 viruses of the Sarbecovirus sub-genus. Most of the representatives of the Sarbecovirus sub-genus are SARS

of major virus classes and the minimum number of neighbours is set to 3 while ε is set to 0.7, DBSCAN considers individual viruses as outliers

to the GISAID database by Lam et al. [8] and a sequence of Guangdong pangolin CoV by Xiao et al. [10].
Evolutionary distances between each of the reference genomes in Set 3 (Table 3) to the 334 SARS-CoV-2 genomes based
on the Jukes-Cantor method are presented in Fig. 5. We can observe that these distances are almost constant across 334
SARS-CoV-2 sequences, which are collected in 16 countries (Table 5) over approximately 3 months since late December
2019. This implies that not much variation of SARS-CoV-2 genomes has occurred over time and across countries. As in
Fig. 5, there are several groups of reference genomes shown via the closeness of the distance lines. For example, the top

from SARS-CoV-2 sequences. The middle group of lines comprises most of the BetaCoV viruses, especially those in
the Sarbecovirus sub-genus. The bottom lines identify reference viruses that are closest to SARS-CoV-2, which include
bat CoV RaTG13, Guangdong pangolin CoV, bat SARS CoV ZC45 and bat SARS CoV ZXC21. The bat CoV RaTG13
line at the bottom is notably distinguished from other lines while the Guangdong pangolin CoV line is the second closest
to SARS-CoV-2. The similarities between bat CoV RaTG13, Guangdong pangolin CoV and Guangxi pangolin CoV

SARS CoVs, bat SARS-like CoVs and pangolin CoVs (Fig. 7A). It is observed that the algorithm reasonably groups
viruses into clusters, for example, the genus AlphaCoV is represented by cluster “4” while the sub-genera Embecovirus,
Nobecovirus, Merbecovirus, and Hibecovirus are labelled as clusters “3”, “6”, “2”, and “1”, respectively. Using the
same cut-off value of 0.7, we next perform clustering on a dataset that merges reference sequences and 16 representative
SARS-CoV-2 sequences (see Fig. 7B). Results on all 334 SARS-CoV-2 sequences, which are similar to those on the
16 representative sequences, are provided in Fig. 10 in Appendix 2. The outcome presented in Fig. 7B shows that
the 16 representative SARS-CoV-2 sequences fall into cluster “5”, which comprises the Sarbecovirus sub-genus. The
number of clusters is still 6 and the membership structure of the clusters is the same as in the case of clustering reference
sequences only (Fig. 7A), except that the Sarbecovirus cluster now has been expanded to also contain SARS-CoV2 sequences. By comparing Figs. 7A and 7B, we believe that SARS-CoV-2 is naturally part of the Sarbecovirus
sub-genus. This realization is substantiated by moving to Fig. 7C that shows a clustering outcome when the cut-off
parameter C is decreased to 0.1. In Fig. 7C, while 3 members of the Merbecovirus sub-genus (i.e. Pipistrellus bat CoV
HKU5, Tylonycteris bat CoV HKU4 and MERS CoV) are divided into 3 clusters (“12”, “2” and “4”) or members of
the Sarbecovirus cluster are separated themselves into 2 clusters “’1” and “11”, sequences of SARS-CoV-2 still join the
cluster “11’ with other members of Sarbecovirus such as 3 bat viruses (bat SARS CoV ZC45, bat SARS CoV ZXC21,
bat CoV RaTG13) and 7 pangolin CoVs.
As the cut-off parameter C decreases, the number of clusters increases. This is an expected outcome because the cut-off
threshold line moves closer to the leaves of the dendrogram. When the cut-off C is reduced to 0.03 (Fig. 7D), there are
only 2 viruses (bat CoV RaTG13 and Guangdong pangolin CoV) that can form a cluster with SARS-CoV-2 (labelled
as cluster “15”). These are 2 viruses closest to SARS-CoV-2 based on the whole genome analysis. Results in Figs. 7C
and 7D therefore provide evidence that bats or pangolins could be possible hosts for SARS-CoV-2. We next reduce
the cut-off C to 0.01 as in Fig. 7E. At this stage, only bat CoV RaTG13 is within the same cluster with SARS-CoV-2
(cluster “17”). We thus believe that bats are the more probable hosts for SARS-CoV-2 than pangolins. The inference of
our AI-enabled analysis is in line with a result in [19] that investigates the polyprotein 1ab of SARS-CoV-2 and suggests
that this novel coronavirus has more likely been arisen from viruses infecting bats rather than pangolins.
When the cut-off C is reduced to 0.001 as in Fig. 7F, we observe that the total number of clusters now increases to 29
and more importantly, SARS-CoV-2 sequences do not combine with any other reference viruses but form its own cluster
“19”. Could we use this clustering result (Fig. 7F) to infer that SARS-CoV-2 might not originate in bats or pangolins?

This is a debatable question because the answer depends on the level of details we use to differentiate between the species
or organisms. The cut-off parameter in hierarchical clustering can be considered as the level of details. With the results
obtained in Fig. 7D (and also in the experiments with the DBSCAN method presented next), we support a hypothesis
that bats or pangolins are the probable origin of SARS-CoV-2. This is because we observe that the similarity between
SARS-CoV-2 and bat CoV RaTG13 (or Guangdong pangolin CoV) is considerably large compared to the similarity
between viruses that originated in the same host. For example, bat SARS-like CoVs such as bat SARS CoV Rf1, bat
SARS CoV Longquan-140, bat SARS CoV HKU3-1, bat SARS CoV Rp3, bat SARS CoV Rs672/2006, bat SARS CoV
RsSHC014, bat SARS CoV WIV1, bat SARS CoV ZC45 and bat SARS CoV ZXC21 had the same bat origin. In Fig.
7D, these viruses however are separated into 2 different clusters (“3” and “2”) while all 16 SARS-CoV-2 representatives
are grouped together with bat CoV RaTG13 and Guangdong pangolin CoV in cluster “15”. This demonstrates that
the difference between the same origin viruses (e.g. bat SARS CoV WIV1 and bat SARS CoV ZC45) is larger than
the difference between SARS-CoV-2 and bat CoV RaTG13 (or Guangdong pangolin CoV). Therefore, SARS-CoV-2
is deemed very likely originated in the same host with bat CoV RaTG13 or Guangdong pangolin CoV, which is bat or
pangolin, respectively.
Clustering outcomes of the DBSCAN method via phylogenetic trees using Set 3 of reference sequences (Table 3) are
presented in Fig. 8. We first apply DBSCAN to reference sequences only, which results in 3 clusters and several outliers
(Fig. 8A). The search radius parameter ε is set equal to 0.55. As we set the minimum number of neighbours parameter to
3, it is expected that viruses of the sub-genera Embecovirus, Nobecovirus and Hibecovirus are detected as outliers “-1”
because there are only 1 or 2 viruses in these sub-genera. Three viruses of the Merbecovirus sub-genus (i.e. Tylonycteris
bat CoV HKU4, Pipistrellus bat CoV HKU5 and MERS CoV) are grouped into the cluster “2”. All examined viruses
of the Sarbecovirus sub-genus are joined in cluster “1” while the AlphaCoV viruses are combined into cluster “3”.
Fig. 8B shows an outcome of DBSCAN with the same ε value of 0.55 and the dataset has been expanded to include
16 representative SARS-CoV-2 sequences. We observe that genomes of SARS-CoV-2 fall into the cluster “1”, which
includes all the examined Sarbecovirus viruses. When ε is decreased to 0.3 in Fig. 8C, all members of the Merbecovirus
cluster or the AlphaCoV cluster become outliers while 16 SARS-CoV-2 genomes still stick with the Sarbecovirus cluster.
In line with the results obtained by using hierarchical clustering in Fig. 7, those obtained in Fig. 8B and 8C using the
DBSCAN method give us the confidence to confirm that SARS-CoV-2 is part of the Sarbecovirus sub-genus. Fig. 8D
shows that bat CoV RaTG13 and Guangdong pangolin CoV are closest to SARS-CoV-2 as they join with 16 SARSCoV-2 representatives in cluster “2”. This again substantiates the probable bat or pangolin origin of SARS-CoV-2. By
reducing ε to 0.1 as in Fig. 8E, the Guangdong pangolin CoV becomes an outlier whilst SARS-CoV-2 sequences form
a cluster (“3”) with only bat CoV RaTG13. This further confirms our findings when using the hierarchical clustering in
Fig. 7 that bats are more likely the reservoir hosts for the SARS-CoV-2 than pangolins. When ε is decreased to 0.01 as
in Fig. 8F, SARS-CoV-2 genomes form its own cluster “3”, which is separated with any bat or pangolin genomes. As
with the result in Fig. 7F by the hierarchical clustering, this result also raises a question whether SARS-CoV-2 really
originated in bats or pangolins. In Fig. 8D, it is again observed that the similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and bat CoV
RaTG13 (or Guangdong pangolin CoV) is larger than the similarity between bat SARS CoVs, which have the same
bat origin. Specifically, SARS-CoV-2, bat CoV RaTG13 and Guangdong pangolin CoV are grouped together in cluster
“2” while bat SARS CoVs are divided into 2 clusters, i.e. bat SARS CoV ZXC21 and bat SARS CoV ZC45 are in
cluster “2” whereas other bat SARS CoVs are in cluster “3”. We thus suggest that SARS-CoV-2 probably has the same
origin with bat CoV RaTG13 or Guangdong pangolin CoV. In other words, bats or pangolins are the probable origin of
SARS-CoV-2.
All results presented above are obtained using the pairwise distances estimated by the Jukes-Cantor method. Results
based on distances calculated by the maximum composite likelihood method are reported in Appendix 3, which are
similar to those obtained by using the Jukes-Cantor method. These AI-based quantitative results using the unsupervised
hierarchical clustering and DBSCAN methods provide more evidences to suggest that 1) SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the
Sarbecovirus sub-genus of the Betacoronavirus genus, 2) bats and pangolins may have served as the hosts for SARSCoV-2, and 3) bats are the more probable origin of SARS-CoV-2 than pangolins.

CONCLUSIONS
The severity of COVID-19 pandemic has initiated a race in finding origin of the COVID-19 virus. Studies on genome
sequences obtained from early patients in Wuhan city in China suggest the probable bat origin of the virus based on
similarities between these sequences and those obtained from bat CoVs previously reported in China. Other studies
afterwards found that SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences are also similar to pangolin CoV sequences and accordingly
raised a hypothesis on the pangolin origin of the COVID-19 virus. This paper has investigated origin of the COVID-19
virus using unsupervised clustering methods and more than 300 raw genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 collected from
various countries around the world. Outcomes of these AI-enabled methods are analysed, leading to a confirmation
on the Coronaviridae family of the COVID-19 virus. More specifically, the SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the sub-genus
Sarbecovirus within the genus Betacoronavirus that includes SARS-CoV, which caused the global SARS pandemic in
2002-2003 [20; 21]. The results of various clustering experiments show that SARS-CoV-2 genomes are more likely to
form a cluster with the bat CoV RaTG13 genome than pangolin CoV genomes, which were constructed from samples
collected in Guangxi and Guangdong provinces in China. This indicates that bats are more likely the reservoir host for
the COVID-19 virus than pangolins. This study among many AI studies in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic
[22] has shown the power and capabilities of AI in this challenging battle, especially from the computational biology
and medicine perspective. The findings of this research on the large dataset of 334 SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences
provide more insights about the COVID-19 virus and thus facilitate the progress on discovering medicines and vaccines
to mitigate its impacts and prevent a similar pandemic in future. The race to produce treatment drugs and vaccines is still
ongoing and no effective results have been reported yet. A further research in this direction is strongly encouraged by a
recent success of AI in identifying powerful new kinds of antibiotic from a pool of more than 100 million molecules as
published in [23]. As AI is capable of analysing large datasets and discovering knowledge from them in an intelligent
and efficient manner, finding a COVID-19 vaccine using AI is a realistic hope [24].

APPENDIX 2
In this Appendix, we first present results of the hierarchical clustering method applied to the dataset that combines Set 1 of reference
sequences (Table 1) with all 334 SARS-CoV-2 sequences (see Fig. 9). We then show results of the hierarchical clustering (Fig. 10)
and DBSCAN (Fig. 11) on a dataset that combines all 334 SARS-CoV-2 sequences and reference sequences in Set 3 (Table 3).

Fig. 9. Results shown via a dendrogram plot (left) of the hierarchical clustering method applied to the dataset that combines reference sequences in
Set 1 (Table 1) and all 334 SARS-CoV-2 sequences. The middle figure shows in detail (zoom in) the top part of the dendrogram plot while the right
figure shows the bottom part of the plot. All 334 SARS-CoV-2 sequences are grouped in cluster “8”, which also includes the Middle East respiratory
syndrome CoV of the Riboviria realm. This means that SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the Riboviria realm. These results are consistent with those shown
in Fig. 1B that, for the demonstration purpose, employed only 16 SARS-CoV-2 genomes, which are representatives of 16 countries in Table 5.

Fig. 10. Dendrogram plots using all 334 SARS-CoV-2 sequences obtained across 16 countries with the hierarchical clustering outcome when the
cut-off parameter C is set equal to 0.7 (left). The middle figure shows in detail (zoom in) the top part of the dendrogram plot while the right figure
shows the bottom part of the plot. All 334 SARS-CoV-2 sequences are grouped in cluster “5”, which also includes SARS CoVs, bat SARS CoVs and
pangolin CoVs. This cluster belongs to the Sarbecovirus sub-genus of the Betacoronavirus genus. Six viruses of the Alphacoronavirus genus (i.e.
TGEV, Mink CoV WD1127, Rhinolophus bat CoV HKU2, human CoV 229E, human CoV NL63 and PEDV) are combined into cluster “4” while
3 viruses of the Merbecovirus sub-genus (i.e. Pipistrellus bat CoV HKU5, Tylonycteris bat CoV HKU4 and MERS CoV) are joined in cluster “2”.
These outcomes are in line with the results obtained in Fig. 7B, which used only 16 representative SARS-CoV-2 genomes.

(zoom in) the bottom part of the tree while the right figure shows the top part of the tree. All 334 SARS-CoV-2 sequences are grouped in cluster “1”,
which also includes SARS CoVs, bat SARS CoVs and pangolin CoVs. This cluster belongs to the Sarbecovirus sub-genus of the Betacoronavirus
genus. Six viruses of the Alphacoronavirus genus (i.e. human CoV NL63, human CoV 229E, Rhinolophus bat CoV HKU2, PEDV, Mink CoV
WD1127 and TGEV) are combined into cluster “3” while 3 viruses of the Merbecovirus sub-genus (i.e. Tylonycteris bat CoV HKU4, Pipistrellus bat
CoV HKU5 and MERS CoV) are joined in cluster “2”. These results are similar to Fig. 8B, which used only 16 representative SARS-CoV-2 genomes
for the demonstration purpose.

APPENDIX 3
This appendix presents results of two clustering methods, i.e. hierarchical clustering and DBSCAN, using the sequence distances
computed by the maximum composite likelihood method [16], which was conducted in the MEGA X software [25]. These results
are greatly similar to those obtained by using the Jukes-Cantor distance method shown throughout the paper. In these experiments,
the clustering methods are applied to a dataset that combines reference sequences in Set 3 (Table 3) and 16 representative genomes
of 16 countries in Table 5. When a country has more than one collected genome, the first released genome of that country is selected
for this experiment. Fig. 12 demonstrates the distances estimated by the maximum composite likelihood method between each of the
reference sequences and 16 representative SARS-CoV-2 genomes. The lines are almost parallel indicating that SARS-CoV-2 genome
is not altered much across countries, which is in line with the results obtained using the Jukes-Cantor distance estimates in Fig. 5. The
bat CoV RaTG13 is again shown much closer to SARS-CoV-2 than pangolin CoVs and other reference viruses although the distance
range in Fig. 12 is larger than that in Fig. 5, i.e. [0, ∼1.6] versus [0, ∼0.7], respectively.

Fig. 12. Evolutionary distances between reference genomes and 16 representative SARS-CoV-2 genomes of 16 countries based on the maximum
composite likelihood method. Each line is composed of 16 data points representing 16 pairwise distances. The bottom line, for instance, shows the
distances between bat CoV RaTG13 and each of 16 representative genomes on the x-axis.

In Fig. 13A, when the hierarchical clustering cut-off parameter is set equal to 0.1, all 16 representative SARS-CoV-2 genomes are
grouped into cluster “12”, which also includes other viruses of the Sarbecovirus sub-genus of the BetaCoV genus. When moving
from Fig. 13A to Fig. 13B, even though members of the Sarbecovirus cluster (“12” in Fig. 13A) are split into 2 clusters “1” and “2”
in Fig. 13B, the SARS-CoV-2 sequences are still grouped into cluster “14” with other members of the Sarbecovirus sub-genus such
as bat CoV RaTG13, Guangdong pangolin CoV, bat SARS CoV ZXC21 and bat SARS CoV ZC45. These results provide us with
a confidence on confirming the Sarbecovirus sub-genus of the SARS-CoV-2. This is consistent with the result based on the JukesCantor distances shown in Fig. 7. Fig. 13C shows that SARS-CoV-2 genomes are combined only with that of bat CoV RaTG13 when
the cut-off parameter is decreased to 0.001. This again indicates that bats are the more likely origin of SARS-CoV-2 than pangolins.
When we reduce the cut-off parameter to 0.0001, the SARS-CoV-2 sequences create their own cluster “22” and this questions the
probable bat or pangolin origin of SARS-CoV-2. However, in Fig. 13B, we also find that the similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and
bat CoV RaTG13 (or Guangdong pangolin CoV) is larger than the similarity between viruses having the same origin. For example,
bat SARS CoV WIV1 and bat SARS CoV ZC45 have the same bat origin but they are divided into 2 clusters (“1” and “14”) while
all 16 SARS-CoV-2 representatives are grouped into cluster “14” with bat CoV RaTG13 and Guangdong pangolin CoV. This implies
that SARS-CoV-2 may have originated in bats or pangolins.
Results of DBSCAN using distances estimated by the maximum composite likelihood method are presented in Fig. 14, which are
also consistent with those obtained by the Jukes-Cantor distance method in Fig. 8, leading to the same suggestions on the sub-genus
Sarbecovirus membership of SARS-CoV-2, its likely bat or pangolin origin, and the more probable bat origin than the pangolin origin
of the virus at the whole genome analysis level.
