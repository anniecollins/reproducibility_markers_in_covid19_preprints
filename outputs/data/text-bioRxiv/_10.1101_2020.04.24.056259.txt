Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic has spread across more than 200 countries and resulted in
over 170,000 deaths. For unclear reasons, higher mortality rates from COVID-19 have
been reported in men compared to women. While the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 and
co-receptor TMPRSS2 have been detected in lung and other tissues, it is not clear what
sex differences may exist. We analyzed a publicly-available normal human prostate
single-cell RNA sequencing dataset and found TMPRSS2 and ACE2 co-expressing
cells in epithelial cells, with a higher proportion in club and hillock cells. Then we
investigated datasets of lung epithelial cells and also found club cells co-expressing
TMPRSS2 and ACE2. A comparison of ACE2 expression in lung tissue between males
and females showed higher expression in males and a larger proportion of ACE2+ cells
in male type II pneumocytes, with preliminary evidence that type II pneumocytes of all
lung epithelial cell types showed the highest expression of ACE2. These results raise
the possibility that sex differences in ACE2 expression and the presence of doublepositive cells in the prostate may contribute to the observed disparities of COVID-19.

Introduction
As of April 23th, 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has infected more than 2.5 million
people across 213 countries and killed over 170,000 [1]. Despite there being
approximately equal number of cases between men and women, emerging reports
across countries indicate a higher mortality from SARS-CoV-2 in men than women,
though the underlying reasons remain unclear [2]. The extent to which this disparity is
due to biological rather than behavioral or comorbid sex differences is unknown.
The SARS-CoV-2 receptor, ACE2, and the co-receptor serine protease TMPRSS2, are
expressed in lung and other tissues implicated in the clinical manifestations of COVID19. However, less is known about the exact cell types expressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2
that serve as cells of entry and pathogenesis for SARS-CoV-2 [3]. Intriguingly,
TMPRSS2, which is one of the most dysregulated genes in prostate cancer, is highly
expressed in human prostate epithelial cells and is androgen-responsive [4]. The
presence of TMPRSS2 in the human prostate and its regulation by androgen raises the
possibility that the prostate may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and that malesex may be a biological risk factor.
Given the high expression of TMPRSS2 expression in the prostate, we investigated
whether TMPRSS2 and ACE2 are co-expressed in human prostate epithelial cells, and
compared our findings to expression levels found in five lung single-cell datasets. Lastly,
we investigate sex differences in the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in lung
epithelia.

Results
Using a publicly-available single-cell RNA sequencing dataset, we analyzed 24,519
epithelial cells from normal human prostates for expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 [5].
In this dataset, 0.32% of all epithelial cells (78 of 24,519), 0.47% of all stromal cells (10
of 2,113), 0.06% of endothelial cells (1 of 1,586) and 0.22% of leukocytes (1 of 459)
expressed ACE2. 18.65% of all epithelial cells (4,573 of 24,519), 41.74% of all stromal
cells (882 of 2,113), 16.71% of endothelial cells (265 of 1,586) and 52.07% of
leukocytes (239 of 459) expressed TMPRSS2. Moreover, we found 30 cells that coexpressed ACE2 and TMPRSS2 (0.11% of epithelial cells, 0.10% of all cells) from
numerous cell types in the prostate: 0.09% of stromal cells (2 of 2,113), 0.06% of
endothelial cells (1 of 1,586), 0.03% of basal epithelial cells (5 of 18,439), 0.18% of
luminal epithelial cells (4 of 2,238), 0.40% of hillock cells (10 of 2,530), and 0.61% of
club cells (8 of 1,312) (Figure 1).
Prostate club cells were found to have the greatest proportion of double-positive cells in
the human prostate, and these cells bear a strong resemblance to lung club cells [5]. To
characterize ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in prostate club cells, we compared the
expression levels of these genes in lung club cells from one mouse lung [6] and four
human lung [7-10] single-cell datasets (Supplementary Table 1). We found a higher
proportion of cells expressing TMPRSS2 than those expressing ACE2 (Figure 1) in all
major lung epithelial cell types (basal epithelial cells, ciliated cells, club cells, type I and
II pneumocytes). Specifically, in club cells, we detected the following proportions of
double-positive cells in the datasets: 0.33% (7 of 2,113) of human lung club cells in the
Reyfman et al. dataset [8]; 0.21% (3 of 1,410) of human lung club cells in the

Habermann et al. dataset [9] (Figure 2); and 1.86% (48 of 2,578) of mouse lung club
cells in the Montoro et al. dataset [6] (Supplementary Figure 1). Two other human lung
datasets showed no such double-positive club cells [7,10] (Figure 2).
Lastly, to test sex differences in expression profiles of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, we
compared ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression differences within the integrated lung
epithelial cells dataset stratified by sex [8,10] (Male: N = 12, Female: N = 19,
Supplementary Table 1). Overall, there was no significant difference in TMPRSS2
expression between males and females in the human lung (Figure 3a). However, ACE2
expression was higher in males (log 2 normalized expression level: 0.019 in male vs
0.0068 in female, p < 0.001, Figure 3a).
To characterize differences in cell types by sex, we then compared ACE2 and
TMPRSS2 proportions of expression in the integrated dataset. We found higher
proportions of type II pneumocytes in males that expressed ACE2 and co-expressed
ACE2 and TMPRSS2 compared to type II pneumocytes in females (p < 0.001, Figure
3c). It is not clear if TMPRSS2 and ACE2 expression are regulated by the same
process but our analysis reveals that their expression levels are positively correlated in
lung cell lines (Supplementary Figure 2).
Discussion

In this study examining ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in prostate and lung epithelia,
we highlight the prostate as a potential organ susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In
human prostate cells, we found hillock and club cells as double-positive cells with the
highest proportion of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 co-expression. Since both of these proteins

are considered to be required for infection, these double-positive cells could potentially
serve as reservoirs for SARS-CoV-2 infiltration and damage to the prostate; however,
they constitute approximately 0.07% of all prostate epithelial cells. Interestingly, Henry
and colleagues recently characterized the prostate club cell [5] as sharing a genetic
signature similar to lung club cells [6]. Therefore, in order to better understand the
prostate’s susceptibility to infection, we compared ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in
both prostate and lung club cells. We found that 0.61% of prostate club cells co-express
ACE2 and TMPRSS2, which correlate with the low numbers of lung club cells with
ACE2 and TMPRSS2 co-expression across four human datasets. Compared to the
proportion of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 co-expression in type II pneumocytes from prior
reports (3.8%) [11], club cells have a markedly lower proportion of double-positive cells.
Implications of SARS-CoV-2 infiltration of the prostate via club cells are unclear and
warrant further investigation.

Here we also report differences in the co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in type II
pneumocytes by sex. In the integrated dataset with sex data reported, male type II
pneumocytes possess a significantly greater proportion of cells expressing ACE2 and
cells co-expressing ACE2 with TMPRSS2. We found no significant difference in
TMPRSS2 expression between male and female lung epithelial cells. This finding is
consistent with another recent report examining the same sex difference [12]. If these
findings are reproducible with greater sample sizes, the greater proportion of ACE2 and
TMPRSS2 co-expression in male type II pneumocytes may contribute to the associated
disparities in COVID-19 pathogenesis. SARS-CoV-2-related alveolar damage has been
implicated to primarily take effect via infiltration of type I and II pneumocytes and ciliated

epithelial cells [13]. Type II pneumocytes perform essential functions for alveolar
integrity via stem-cell properties and surfactant secretion [14], and their demise can
contribute to alveolar collapse and respiratory failure. However, we caution against the
generalizability of these findings due to the small sample size, lack of consensus among
the data, and the lack of control for confounding variables that may modulate ACE2 or
TMPRSS2 expression such as smoking [8,10].

Here we find that prostate epithelial cells co-express TMPRSS2 and ACE2 with the
highest proportion found in hillock and club cells. Whether differences in TMPRSS2 and
ACE2 expression mediate SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and whether androgen signaling
can affect COVID-19 disease remain to be studied. Sex differences in TMPRSS2 and
ACE2 expression could influence potential sites of disease and viral reservoirs. Sex
differences in TMPRSS2 expression alone in the lung may not drive the higher burden
of SARS-CoV-2 disease among men. However, our finding that distinct populations of
cells in the prostate co-express TMPRSS2 and ACE2 raises the possibility that sex
differences could influence COVID-19 disease pathogenesis in males differently than
females. Further research into TMPRSS2 expression and its modulation within the lung
and other relevant cell types that may impact ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis is
needed.

Methods
We adopted previously published single cell RNA-seq datasets of normal human
prostate epithelial cells, mouse lung, and four human lung epithelial cells
(Supplementary Table 1). Datasets were acquired using the raw count matrices made
available by previous studies. For the human prostate, mouse, the Reyfman et al. and
the Habermann et al. human lung datasets, cell types were annotated by respective cell
type annotation metadata provided in the original studies and validated by top gene
markers [5,6,8,9]. The cell type of the epithelial cell population in the Vieira Braga et al.,
dataset [7] was annotated by the top differentially expressed markers and validated by
another previous study [15]. Similarly, the cell type of epithelial cell population in the
Raredon et al. dataset [10] was annotated. Sample sex data were acquired for the
Reyfman study and the Raredon study [8,10] but unavailable for the other human lung
datasets [7,9]. All datasets were analyzed in R using the Seurat 3.1.4 package for
visualization and comparison [16]. Gene expression in each dataset was normalized
and scaled following the standard Seurat workflow, and sample batch effects were
removed using the integration function implemented in Seurat 3.1.4 [16]. Cell
distribution in each dataset was visualized in Uniform Manifold Approximation and
Projection (UMAP), generated based on the principal component analysis and colorcoded by different cell types annotation from the original study. The Reyfman et al.
dataset and the Raredon et al. dataset were integrated following the Seurat 3.1.4
integration workflow to remove the batch effect from different samples and stratified by
sex of samples reported in the original studies. Top differentially expressed gene
markers were identified using the FindAllMarker function built within Seurat and ranked
