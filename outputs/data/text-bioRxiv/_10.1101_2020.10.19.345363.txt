Abstract

10

SARS-CoV-2 emerged in late 2019 and caused a pandemic, whereas the closely related

11

SARS-CoV was contained rapidly in 2003. Here, a newly developed experimental set-up

12

was used to study transmission of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 through the air between

13

ferrets over more than a meter distance. Both viruses caused a robust productive

14

respiratory tract infection resulting in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to two of four indirect

15

recipient ferrets and SARS-CoV to all four. A control pandemic A/H1N1 influenza virus

16

also transmitted efficiently. Serological assays confirmed all virus transmission events.

17

Although the experiments did not discriminate between transmission via small aerosols,

18

large droplets and fomites, these results demonstrate that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2

19

can remain infectious while travelling through the air. Efficient virus transmission between

20

ferrets is in agreement with frequent SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in mink farms. Although the

21

evidence for airborne virus transmission between humans under natural conditions is

22

absent or weak for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, ferrets may represent a sensitive model

23

to study interventions aimed at preventing virus transmission.

Introduction

27

In December 2019, pneumonia cases were reported in China, caused by a virus that was

28

closely related to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 1,2. In

29

2003, the SARS-CoV outbreak affected 26 countries and resulted in more than 8000

30

human cases of infection of whom almost 800 died 3. In contrast to SARS-CoV, the new

31

coronavirus, named SARS-CoV-2, spread around the world in only a few months, with

32

over 30 million cases and more than 900.000 deaths by the end of September 2020 4. So

33

far there is no unambiguous experimental or observational evidence on the main mode

34

of transmission of SARS-CoV-2. However, given that most outbreaks occurred in clusters

35

of people in close contact and in household settings, international health authorities

36

conclude that SARS-CoV-2 is primarily transmitted within a short distance between

37

individuals via direct and indirect contact, or respiratory droplets with little support for an

38

important contribution of airborne transmission 5. To prevent transmission via both routes,

39

the World Health Organization and governments have advised control measures such as

40

frequent hand washing and physical distancing to mitigate the rapid spread of SARS-

41

CoV-2. In addition, in many countries the use of face masks is encouraged or enforced in

42

public buildings or public transportation where physical distancing is not always possible.

43

We and others previously used ferret models to show that SARS-CoV can be

44

transmitted via direct contact and that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted via the air over

45

10 cm distance 6-8. To study if SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 can maintain their infectivity

46

when bridging a distance of more than one meter through the air, a new experimental

47

ferret transmission set-up was developed. After validation of the set-up with A/H1N1

Results

52

Transmission of A/H1N1 virus between ferrets.

53

To investigate coronavirus transmission via the air over more than a meter distance, a

54

new transmission set-up was built in which individual donor and indirect recipient ferret

55

cages were connected through a hard duct system consisting of horizontal and vertical

56

pipes with multiple 90° turns. The airflow was directed upwards from the donor to the

57

indirect recipient animal and air travelled on average 118 cm through the tube (Fig. 1). A

58

steel grid was placed between each cage and tube opening to prevent spill-over of food,

59

faeces and other large particles.

60

The new transmission set-up was first tested using A/H1N1 influenza virus

61

A/Netherlands/602/2009, that was previously shown to be transmitted efficiently through

62

the air between ferrets over 10 cm distance

63

animals were inoculated intranasally with 106 TCID50 (median tissue culture infectious

64

dose) of A/H1N1 virus and the next day indirect recipient ferrets were placed in separate

65

cages above those of the donor ferrets. Throat and nasal swabs were collected from

66

donor and indirect recipient animals on alternating days to prevent cross-contamination,

67

followed by virus detection by qRT-PCR and virus titration. Swabs were collected from

68

donor and indirect recipient animals until 7 days post inoculation (dpi) and 13 days post

69

exposure (dpe), respectively. A/H1N1 virus was detected until 7 dpi in donor animals, with

70

the highest RNA levels until 5 dpi (Fig. 2A). Attempts to isolate infectious virus were

71

successful in all four animals until 5 dpi and in one animal until 7 dpi (Fig. 3A). A/H1N1

72

virus was transmitted to indirect recipient ferrets in four out of four independent

73

transmission pairs between 1 and 3 dpe onwards, as demonstrated by the presence of

(Table 1). Four individually housed donor

viral RNA in throat and nose swabs. Infectious A/H1N1 virus was isolated from three out

75

of four indirect recipient animals with similar peak virus titers and duration of virus

76

shedding as observed in the donor animals. In these three animals, virus titers ranged

77

from 101.5 to 106.0 TCID50/ml, showing that these indirect recipient ferrets were

78

productively infected (Fig. 3A). Besides nasal discharge, no other signs of illness were

79

observed in the A/H1N1 virus positive donor and indirect contact animals (Fig. 2A and

80

3A). Three of four A/H1N1 virus positive animals seroconverted 15 dpi/dpe, and the

81

hemagglutination inhibition titers were similar in donor and indirect recipients animals.

82

The indirect recipient animal with low RNA levels and no infectious virus did not

83

seroconvert (Fig. 4A).

Upon validation of the new experimental transmission set-up with A/H1N1 virus, the

88

transmissibility of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 over more than one meter distance was

assessed, using the same procedures as for A/H1N1 virus. Four donor animals were

All donor animals were productively infected, as demonstrated by the robust and long-

93

term virus shedding (Fig. 2, Fig. 3). SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels peaked around 3 and 5 dpi

94

and were detected up to 13 dpi in one animal and up to 15 dpi, the last day of sample

95

collection, in the other three animals. In contrast, SARS-CoV RNA levels peaked

97

symptoms of disease, SARS-CoV donor animals became less active and exhibited

98

breathing difficulties from 7 dpi onwards, warranting euthanasia by 9 dpi, when all animals

99

were still SARS-CoV RNA positive in throat and nasal swabs (Fig. 2).

100

Interestingly, both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV transmitted to indirect recipient

101

animals via the air over more than one meter distance. SARS-CoV-2 was transmitted in

102

two out of four independent transmission pairs at 3 dpe, with peak viral RNA levels at 7

103

dpe and throat and nasal swabs still positive for viral RNA at 15 dpe, the last day of the

104

experiment (Fig. 2B). Similar to the donor animals, the indirect recipient ferrets did not

105

show any signs of illness. SARS-CoV was transmitted to four out of four indirect recipient

106

ferrets on 1 or 3 dpe, with peak viral RNA levels at 3 to 5 dpe (Fig. 2C). Similar to the

107

donor animals, indirect recipient animals exhibited breathing difficulties and became less

108

active and were consequently euthanized for ethical reasons at 11 dpe, at which time the

109

throat and nasal swabs were still positive for SARS-CoV RNA.

110

All SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 positive indirect recipient ferrets had

111

seroconverted at 11 and 17 dpe, respectively (Fig. 4). The two indirect recipient ferrets,

112

in which no SARS-CoV-2 was detected, did not seroconvert. Despite the different

113

inoculation routes and doses of the donors that were given a high virus dose in a large

114

volume of liquid and indirect recipient animals that likely received a lower infectious dose

115

via the air, the kinetics of virus shedding were similar in all animals, both in terms of

116

duration and virus RNA levels. This indicated a robust replication of both SARS-CoV-2

117

and SARS-CoV upon transmission via the air, independent of the infectious dose and

118

route. In general, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels were higher in the throat

119

swabs as compared to the nasal swabs. From each SARS and SARS-CoV-2 RNA

Investigating the potential of fomite transmission

124

In SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks on mink farms in the Netherlands, a potential route of virus

125

transmission through aerosolized fomites originating from bedding, fur and food has been

126

suggested 10. Although the current transmission set-up was designed to prevent spill-over

127

of large pieces like food and faeces from donor to recipient cages, smaller particles such

128

as aerosolized fur or dust from the carpet tiles in the cages, could potentially still be

129

transmitted to the recipient cage. This has very recently been demonstrated in the guinea

130

pig model where a virus-immune animal, whose body was contaminated with influenza

131

virus, transmitted the virus through the air to an indirect recipient animal

132

measurements with an aerodynamic particle sizer in our new set-up showed that particles

133

>10 µm were present in the donor cages, but also at the entrance of the recipient cages,

134

suggesting that despite the distance between the cages, larger particles were carried to

135

the recipient animals due to the high flow rate. To study if fur could serve as a carrier for

136

infectious virus, fur swabs from the left and right flank of SARS-CoV inoculated donor

137

ferrets were also collected in the last experiment from 3 to 9 dpi. SARS-CoV RNA was

138

detected in fur swabs of all donor ferrets (Fig 5). This analysis showed that the grooming

139

of ferrets can result in virus contamination of fur. SARS-CoV RNA levels were on average

140

240-fold (7,9 Ct) lower than those in throat and nasal swabs of the same donor ferrets.

141

Importantly, no infectious virus was isolated from these fur samples. The inability to detect

145

Discussion

146

Here, it is shown for the first time that SARS-CoV can be transmitted through the air

147

between ferrets and that both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are transmissible through the

148

air between ferrets over more than a meter distance, similar to a control A/H1N1 influenza

149

virus.

150

In the newly developed transmission set-up, ferret cages were connected by a hard

151

duct system with four 90° turns and a flow rate of approximately 100 L/min. The shortest

152

and longest distance between inlet and outlet of the duct system was 73 and 163 cm

153

respectively, so that viruses shed by the donor animal had to bridge an average distance

154

of 118 cm before reaching the cage of the indirect recipient ferret. Based on airflow

155

fundamentals, it is anticipated that the minimal distance of the path followed by the

156

particles through the duct is 1 m. The duct system was designed to have an upward

157

airflow, with the aim to prevent large particles to reach the outlet of the duct system.

158

Unfortunately, particles >10 µm that originated from the donor cage were detected in the

159

indirect recipient cage, which was likely due to the relatively high flow rate. As a

160

consequence, the set-up described here does not allow the discrimination between

161

transmission of viruses via aerosols, droplets and aerosolized fomites, and therefore

162

transmission between ferrets can occur via either route.

163

Ferrets and minks both belong to the Mustelinea subfamily of the Mustelidae

164

family. Minks are the first animal species for which SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks have been

165

reported, and to date, outbreaks have been detected on 53 mink farms in the Netherlands

166

and on several mink farms in Denmark, Spain and the USA

167

first two outbreaks, 119 out of 120 serum samples collected from minks were positive,

168

indicating that SARS-CoV-2 had spread readily through the population

The high

169

infection rate among minks together with the productive SARS-CoV-2 infection in ferrets

170

suggests that mustelids are highly susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2, perhaps

171

even more so than humans.

172

Epidemiological studies in humans in 2003 demonstrated that SARS-CoV

173

transmission occurred often during the second week of illness. Virus excretion in

174

respiratory secretions and stool followed a Gaussian distribution and peaked

175

approximately 10 days after symptom onset when patients were often already

176

hospitalized

177

occurred in healthcare settings, predominantly when adequate infection control

178

precautions were absent. Virus transmission via the air was limited to hospital procedures

179

where mechanical aerosol formation could not be prevented. The fact that SARS-CoV

180

was transmitted efficiently via the air between ferrets thus does not align well with the lack

181

of evidence for efficient SARS-CoV virus transmission via the air between humans under

182

natural conditions. In the four indirect recipient animals that became infected with SARS-

183

CoV upon transmission via the air, virus replication peaked as early as 3 to 5 dpe (Fig 3).

184

This demonstrated that SARS-CoV replicates remarkably faster to peak titers in ferrets

185

as compared to the 10 days after symptom onset in humans, and indicated that ferrets

186

are also highly susceptible for SARS-CoV as observed for SARS-CoV-2, which may have

187

contributed to the observed high efficiency of transmission in the ferret model.

13-16.

Hence, most cases of SARS-CoV human-to-human transmission

188

Distinctive from what was described for SARS-CoV, infection with SARS-CoV-2 is

189

characterized by long-term shedding of virus RNA in patients, characterized by peak RNA

190

levels on the day of symptom onset or earlier and infectious virus has primarily been

191

successfully isolated in the initial phase of illness

During several outbreaks in

192

churches, nursing homes, call centers, cruise-ships and restaurants a potential role for

193

SARS-CoV-2 transmission via the air has been debated but remained inconclusive as

194

other transmission routes could not be excluded 20-24. In a few studies, low concentrations

195

of SARS-CoV-2 RNA were detected in air samples collected in healthcare settings

196

However, in only one study infectious SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from air samples

197

collected in a hospital room, 2 – 4.8 m away from patients 29. Despite the lack of evidence

198

that exposure to SARS-CoV-2 over substantial distances poses a high infection risk, the

199

debate about the potential role of small aerosols and large droplets in SARS-CoV-2

200

transmission through the air remains.

25-28.

201

It was recently shown for influenza virus in the guinea pig model that virus

202

transmission through the air is also possible via aerosolized fomites originating from fur;

203

animals transmitted the virus to 25% of the indirect recipient animals when 108 PFU of

204

influenza virus was applied on fur, compared to 88% via airways and fur upon intranasal

205

inoculation 11. In the present study, SARS-CoV RNA was detected on fur swabs from four

206

out of four donor animals but no infectious virus was isolated. In contrast, in the guinea

207

pig study of Asadi et al., up to 650 PFU of infectious influenza virus was recovered from

208

fur of intranasally inoculated animals, which is not a surprise since influenza viruses

209

replicate to much higher titers than SARS-CoV-2 as also shown in Figure 3. Thus,

210

although transmission via aerosolized fomite particles cannot be excluded in the present

211

study, the low amounts of viral RNA and undetectable levels of infectious virus in fur as

212

compared to those in the guinea pig studies makes this a less likely route here.

213

The efficiency of transmission via the air depends on the anatomical site of virus

214

excretion, the amount and duration of infectious virus shedding in the air, the ability of the

215

virus to remain infectious in the air, and the infectious dose required to initiate an infection

216

in an individual. It was recently shown that influenza A viruses are transmitted via the air

217

from the nasal respiratory epithelium of ferrets

218

SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in nose and throat swabs of all infected ferrets. In

219

COVID-19 patients, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was also easily detected in upper respiratory tract

220

(URT) specimens, however the detection rate of SARS-CoV RNA in URT specimens of

221

SARS patients was low, with SARS-CoV RNA detection by RT-PCR in only 32% to 68%

222

of the tested patients

223

replication of SARS-CoV in the upper respiratory tract, may explain why SARS-CoV was

224

less efficiently transmitted between humans than SARS-CoV-2.

In the current study, SARS-CoV and

This lower detection rate, likely as a result of lower or no

225

The RNA levels and infectious SARS-CoV-2 titers detected in respiratory swabs

226

collected from ferrets and humans were similar 33. However, the duration and moment of

227

peak virus shedding are different, as described above. The susceptibility to infection is

228

probably different between ferrets and humans, especially given the difference in

229

efficiency of spread observed in ferrets and minks on one hand and humans on the other

230

hand. With respect to the ferret model it should be noted that in the experimental set-up

231

with uni-directional airflow described here, indirect contact animals are constantly at the

232

right place at the right moment, which may contribute to the relatively high efficiency of

233

virus transmission via the air. It is also important to note that superspreading events

234

played a critical role in the epidemiology of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Several

235

superspreading events were identified during the SARS-CoV outbreak and there is

236

growing evidence for such events during the COVID-19 pandemic 34-37. However, it is still

237

unknown which transmission route is predominantly involved in these events

38.

238

Altogether, our data on the transmissibility of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2

239

demonstrate qualitatively that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 can remain infectious when

240

transmitted through the air over more than one meter distance. However, quantitatively,

241

the data should be interpreted with caution and no conclusions can be drawn about the

242

importance of airborne transmission in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the human

243

population. Although the evidence for airborne virus transmission between humans under

244

natural conditions is absent or very weak for both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, ferrets

245

may represent a sensitive model to study intervention strategies aimed at preventing virus

246

transmission.

Fig. 1 Experimental transmission set-up. Schematic representation of the set-up to

266

assess transmission over > 1 m distance. An inoculated donor ferret is housed in the

267

bottom cage and the next day, an indirect recipient ferret is added to the top cage. The

268

cages are connected through a hard duct system consisting of four 90° turns. The system

269

is built of several horizontal and vertical 15 cm wide PVC pipes that allow upward airflow

270

from the donor to the indirect recipient animal. The average length of the duct system is

271

118 cm with the shortest and longest length 73 and 163 cm, respectively. A steel grid is

272

placed over the inlet and outlet of the duct system. The bottom five cm of the grid was

Ferret transmission experiment

443

Animals were housed and experiments were performed in strict compliance with the

444

Dutch legislation for the protection of animals used for scientific purposes (2014,

445

implementing EU Directive 2010/63). Influenza virus, SARS-CoV-2 and Aleutian Disease

446

Virus seronegative 6 month-old female ferrets (Mustela putorius furo), weighing 640–

447

1215 g, were obtained from a commercial breeder (TripleF, USA). Research was

448

conducted under a project license from the Dutch competent authority (license number

449

248 AVD1010020174312) and the study protocols were approved by the institutional

450

Animal Welfare Body (Erasmus MC permit number 17-4312-03, 17-4312-05 and 17-

451

4312-06). Animal welfare was monitored on a daily basis. Virus inoculation of ferrets was

452

performed under anesthesia with a mixture of ketamine/medetomidine (10 and 0.05 mg

453

kg−1 respectively) antagonized by atipamezole (0.25 mg kg−1). Swabs were taken under

454

light anesthesia using ketamine to minimize animal discomfort. Four donor ferrets were

455

inoculated intranasally with 106 TCID50 of A/H1N1 virus, 6x105TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2 or

456

1.6x106 TCID50 of SARS-CoV (250 μl instilled dropwise in each nostril) and were housed

457

individually in a cage. One day later, indirect recipient ferrets were added in a cage placed

458

above the donor cage. Both cages were connected by a 15 cm wide duct system with

459

four 90° turns. The average length of the duct system was 118 cm long, with an upward

460

air flow from the donor to the indirect recipient cage (Fig 1). Throat and nasal swabs

461

were collected from the ferrets every other alternating day to prevent cross-

462

contamination. For the assessment of A/H1N1 virus transmission between ferrets, swabs

463

of donor and indirect recipient animals were collected until 7 dpi and 13 dpe, respectively.

464

Swabs of donor and indirect recipient animals for the SARS-CoV-2 experiment were

465

collected until 15 dpi/dpe. Swabs of SARS-CoV inoculated donor animals were collected

466

until 9 dpi and of indirect recipient animals until 11 dpe. All swabs were stored at −80°C

467

in virus transport medium consisting of Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) – Eagle with

468

Hank’s BSS and 25 mM Hepes (Lonza), glycerol 99% (Sigma Aldrich), lactalbumin

471

streptomycin mixture (Lonza) for end-point titration in Vero E6 cells as described below.

472

Ferrets were euthanized by heart puncture under anesthesia. Blood was collected in

473

serum-separating tubes (Greiner) and processed according to the manufacturer’s

474

instructions. Sera were heated for 30 min at 60 °C and used for the detection of virus

475

specific antibodies as described below. All animal experiments were performed in class

476

III isolators in a negatively pressurized ABSL3+ facility.

477

RNA isolation and qRT-PCR

478

Virus RNA was isolated from swabs using an in-house developed high-throughput

479

method in a 96-well format, as described previously. Sixty μl of sample was added to 90

480

μl of MagNA Pure 96 External Lysis Buffer. A known concentration of phocine distemper

481

virus (PDV) was added to the sample as internal control for the RNA extraction39. The

482

150 μl of sample/lysis buffer was added to a well of a 96-well plate containing 50 μl of

483

magnetic beads (AMPure XP, Beckman Coulter). After thorough mixing by pipetting up

484

and down at least 10 times, the plate was incubated for 15 minutes (min) at room

485

temperature. The plate was then placed on a magnetic block (DynaMag™-96 Side Skirted

486

Magnet, ThermoFisher Scientific) and incubated for 3 min to allow the displacement of

487

touching the beads and beads were washed three times for 30 seconds (sec) at room

489

temperature with 200 μl/well of 70% ethanol. After the last wash, a 10 μl multi-channel

490

pipet was used to remove residual ethanol. Plates were air-dried for 6 min at room

491

temperature. Plates were removed from the magnetic block and 50 μl of elution buffer

492

(Roche) was added to each well and mixed by pipetting up and down 10 times. Plates

493

were incubated for 5 min at room temperature and then placed back on the magnetic

494

block for 2 min to allow separation of the beads. Supernatants were pipetted in a new

495

plate and RNA was kept at 4°C. The RNA was directly used for qRT-PCR using primers

496

and probes targeting the M gene of pH1N1 virus, the E gene of SARS-CoV-2 or the NP

497

gene of SARS-CoV, as previously described40-42. The primers and probe for PDV

498

detection were also described previously39.

Virus titrations

500

Throat and nasal swabs were titrated in quadruplicates in either MDCK or VeroE6 cells.

501

Briefly, confluent cells were inoculated with 10-fold (A/H1N1 virus) and 3-fold (SARS-

502

CoV-2 and SARS-CoV) serial dilutions of sample in serum-free EMEM supplemented with

503

20 µg/ml trypsin (Lonza) for MDCK cells, or Opti-MEM I (1X) + GlutaMAX, supplemented

504

with penicillin (10,000 IU mL-1), streptomycin (10,000 IU ml-1), primocinTM (50 mg/ml,

505

Invivogen) for Vero E6 cells. At one hpi, the first three dilutions were washed twice with

506

media and 200 µl fresh media was subsequently added to the whole plate. For swabs of

507

ferrets from the A/H1N1 virus experiment, supernatants of cell cultures were tested for

508

agglutination activity using turkey erythrocytes three days after inoculation. For swabs of

509

ferrets from the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 experiments, virus positivity was assessed

510

by reading out cytopathic effects in the cell cultures. Infectious virus titers (TCID50 ml-1)

were calculated from four replicates of each throat and nasal swab using the Spearman-

512

Karber method.

Serology

514

Sera of ferrets from the A/H1N1 virus experiment were tested for virus specific antibodies

515

using the hemagglutination inhibition assay, as described previously43. Briefly, ferret

516

antisera were treated with receptor-destroying enzyme (Vibrio cholerae neuraminidase)

517

and incubated at 37°C overnight, followed by inactivation of the enzyme at 56°C for one

518

hour. Twofold serial dilutions of the antisera, starting at a 1:10 dilution, were mixed with

519

25 μl phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing four hemagglutinating units of virus and

520

were incubated at 37°C for 30 min. Subsequently, 25 μl 1% turkey erythrocytes were

521

added, and the mixture was incubated at 4°C for one hour. HI titers were read and

522

expressed as the reciprocal value of the highest dilution of the serum that completely

523

inhibited agglutination of virus and erythrocytes. Sera of ferrets from the SARS-CoV and

524

SARS-CoV-2 experiments were tested for virus specific antibodies using a receptor

525

binding domain (RBD) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as described

526

previously, with some modifications44. Briefly, ELISA plates were coated overnight with

527

SARS-CoV NP protein (Sino Biological Inc.). After blocking, sera were added and

528

incubated for 1 h at 37°C. Bound antibodies were detected using horseradish peroxidase

529

(HRP)-labelled goat anti-ferret IgG (Abcam) and 3,3',5,5'-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB,

530

Life Technologies) as a substrate. The absorbance of each sample was measured at 450

531

nm. OD-values higher than two times the background value of negative serum (0.02) were

532

considered positive.
