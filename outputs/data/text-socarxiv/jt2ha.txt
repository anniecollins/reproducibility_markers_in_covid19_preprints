"1" "Introduction"
"2" "Wellness  influencer  and celebrity chef , Pete Evans, caused controversy in November 2020 for posting an im age on Instagram featuring the black sun , a neo-Nazi symbol associated with the Christchurch gunman.  He shared a post on Instagram the following day of a rainbow heart apologising ‘to anyone who misinterpreted’ his post   and  ‘perceived that [he]  was promoting hatred ’ .  It is not the first time  that  Evans has caused controversy during the pandemic. In April  2020 ,  he  was fined $25,200AUD by the Therapeutic Goods  Association for advertising a bio charger  for $15,000AUD, which he falsely clai med could be used to treat the ‘Wuhan coronavirus’ .  H e has also  post ed  anti-vaccine, anti-mask   and  anti-lockdown  messages on social media , while endorsing  pro-Trump, MAGA and  QAnon ,   conspiracy theories .   Evans  is not alone in this type of messaging. During the pandemic, a series of individuals have accumulated large  online  followings by  exploiting  the   participatory affordances of social media and  the  underlying principles of wellness culture to spread misinformation, conspiracy theories and   far-right discourse ."
"3" "One of the key challenges  during the pandemic is the overabundance of information shared  online  about the virus, which makes is difficult to discern what to believe. This ‘ infodemic ’, a s the World Health Organisation  terms it, has been facilitated in part by  i nfluencers  amplifying  false and misleading advice .   S everal  studies examining  the dissemination of  5G conspiracy theories ( Bruns  et al., 2020 ) and  the viral spread of  the conspiracy theory  video ,  Plandemic  (20 20 ),  on social media  found that while most  posts  we re created  by ordinary users, those tweets with the greatest level of  engagement were  shared  by influencer s with large online followings  ( Baker, 2020a;   DiResta  and  García -Camargo,  2020 ).   Most of these influ encers were associated with  the  pro-Trump, conspiracy t heory group, QAnon ,   with  wellness influencers playing  a key role in  amplify ing  the video   to  mainstream  audiences   ( Breland ,  2020 ) . The association between QAnon   and wellness culture became so  significant  that leading figures of the wellness community publicly distanced themselves from the group .  In  September  2020 , the international  yoga teacher, Sean Corn, released a joint statement on Instagram in collaboration with other leaders from the wellness community rejecting the principles of QAnon:"
"4" "I do not support QAnon and their underlying message of hate, fear and division. They are an alt-right movement of conspiracy theorists working to spread misinformation, confusion and paranoia …   🙏  # revolutionofthesoul  #unite2stopq  (Corn ,  2020)."
"5" "Although it is not the first time that alternative health practices have been associated with  fascism  ( Goodrick -Clarke, 1992;  Proctor ,  1988 ;  Ward and  Voas ,  2011 ),  questions  emerged  as to how  QAnon, which originated as a far-right, fringe phenomenon, populated by pro-Trump, conspiracy theorists ,   was able  to  in filtrate the wellness community  ( Breland ,  2020 ) .   Given the wellness movement’s association with the counter culture of the  19 60s,  one would expect  QAnon  to be  antithetical to   wellness culture ’s  progressive, liberal beliefs.  T he link , however,  is not altogether surprising.  A  similar convergence  is found  between  far-right and wellness   communities  when examining 5G and anti-vaccine narratives on social media.   Wellness  influencers  may  not share  QAnon’s   far-right  extremism, but both groups are bound by a common ideology and distrust of institutional authority – the government,  the pharmaceutical and  vaccine industry – which they see as promoting compliance, obedience and surveillance. Many have genuine concerns about authoritarian control and fears about the government’s attempt to curtail civil liberties via mandatory vaccine programmes, lockdowns and mask wearing , which have transpired into conspiratorial thinking .   The pursuit of wellness is also conceived in terms of health  optimisation  and human potentiality  (Dunn, 1959) , which resonates with  the  New Age movement’s emphasis on  self-actualisation  and spiritual awakening.  Both  purport  to  provide  personal  solutions to  the hidden agendas and nefarious politics presented by conspiratorial worldviews.  Ward and  Voas  (2011) call  the  fusion between conspiracy theories and spirituality, ‘conspirituality’. The term is used to describe an ideological movement driven by political disillusionment and the popularity of alternative worldviews rooted in  New Age spirituality.   While  some  argue  that the  confluence  of alternative spirituality with conspiracy theories is neither new nor surprising  (Asprem and Dyrendal, 2015),  the internet is central to the importation of this political and spiritual ideology into the mainstream (Ward and  Voas , 2011:  116 ).  Despite the relevance of conspirituality to the current ‘infodemic’, the  dynamics of  this  ‘web movement’, as Ward and  Voas  (2011)  indicate ,  is u n explored by scholars,  yet  it is clear  that  the  internet   and influencer  culture facilitate s   its  diffusion."
"6" "T his article examines  the key techniques used by  internet   users to self-brand as  alt. health  influencers during the pandemic .   Drawing on a series of case studies, I examine  three  presentation  strategies used by influencers to appeal to alternati ve  health and wellness communities  and make conspiratorial thinking more mainstream. N ext, I  analyse   how these strategies  exploit  the   principles  of  wellness culture and the  participatory  affordances of social media to appeal to  online  audiences .   I conclude by discussing the implications of this framing in terms of  public  health   and power  relations ."
"7" "Methodology"
"8" "In this study  I  use a  qualitative  case study approach  to   analyse  the presentation strategies  employed  by  four   internet  users to establish  influence  in the alternative health and wellness  space  during the pandemic.  I refer to  these individuals  as ‘alt. health influencers’   as  they monetise their audiences by appealing to alternative health and wellness  modalitie s  instead of conventional medicine .  For some, their brand is  monetis ed  through  products , courses  and  supplements  marketed as improving  nutritional and emotional well-being . For others, wellness is  monetis ed  through  blogs,  books,  films,  retreats  and  festivals  promoted as tools for  self-actualisation,   expanded consciousness and  spiritual  awakening . All are framed as alternative modes of  knowledge   and practice  driven towards  self-improvement and  health  optimisation , thereby, resonating with the tenets of wellness  culture ."

"25" "These accounts were selected on the basis of  the ir follower counts and the   celebrity  status they achieved   in the  alternative health and  wellness  space   during the pandemic , which enabled them to self-brand as  alt. health  influencers .  The analysis took place  primarily  on Instagram given that most of the activity  involving these influencers  occurred on the  platform .  This was ,  in part ,  a result of  more stringent  content moderation  practices  and suspensions   introduc ed by mainstream social media platforms  during the pandemic . W hile many of the major technology companies updated their harm policies  in 2020  to combat fraud and misinformation about the virus, these policies  were inconsistently applied  (Baker et al., 2020) . For example,   YouTube  remov ed   Sac ha Stone  and David Avocado Wolfe ’s account s   while   Twitter and  Instagram   allowed   the m  to remain on the ir  site s .  Facebook  suspended Stone in January 2021 and  permanently suspended  Pete Evans’ account  in December 2020 for breaching  the company’s  COVID-19 misinformation policy, while Instagram did not ,  despite being owned by  Facebook .  As a result, Instagram  was the main site   used  for data collection.  Data was  collected  for 1 2 months from 11 March 2020 ,  when  the pandemic was declared .   After analysing all of the content shared by these influencers on Instagram  over a 12-month period  (including  videos and interviews they shared on the site) , c ontent was  then   inductively  coded  using thematic analysis   ( Braun and  Clarke ,  2006 )  to identify the  key techniques used to  establ ish and sustain their influence  online .   From these codes, three overlapping themes were identified: 1) micro-celebrity, 2)  the persecuted hero  and  3) calls  to participate   in the journey ."
"26" "F oster ing  intimacy and connection  through micro-celebrity"
"27" "All of the influencers examined in this study are considered micro-celebrities in the alternative health and wellness s pac e.  Micro-celebrity is a way of achieving celebrity status online to a niche community of followers.  The term was coined  by Theresa  Senft  in her  study  of  Camgirls  (2008)  to describe ‘a new style of online performance that involves people “ amping  up” their popularity over the Web using technologies like video, blogs and social networking sites’ ( Senft ,  2008: 25).   The term has since been  applied  to  examine  how visibility  and status  is achieved through self-broadcasting on social media  in a variety of contexts including   tech   start ups  (Marwick, 2013),  fashion  (Duffy ,   2016 ),  health and  wellness ( Baker and  Rojek , 2019 , 2020 )   and politics ( Marwick and  Lewis ,  2017;  Lewis ,  2020) .  While many achieve  fame and commercial success, u nlike mainstream celebrities ,  who remain remote in their extraordinary skills and abilities, micro-celebrities emphasise their ordinariness through publicising their everyday lives on social media ( Abidin ,   2015 ) .   By virtue of using social media technologies widely accessible to the  public , micro-celebrities present  themselves as  equals with their followers,  many of  whom occupy the same online spaces.  There is a performative dimension to this understanding with micro-celebrity  both  a noun describing a category of people,  and  a verb used to describe  the  practices through which social media users  convey  the appearance of intimate,  authentic  exchange  to  build an  online following (Marwick ,  2013)."
"28" "Part of the appeal of micro-celebrities  is the way  in which their fame is bound up with utopian ideals of  democratic participation. Just as the internet was  originally  pe rceived to be ‘the great  equalis er ’ ( boyd ,   2014 ),  social media  has largely been   considered  a  democratic  force  in so far as  these technologies   facilitate  ‘participatory culture’  ( Jenkins ,   2006 ) .  Accessibility is a key attribute of micro-celebrity .  These platforms present themselves  as democratic and egalitarian precisely  because they are accessible  to the public  and  afford   users   the capacity  to  self- broadcast  online  (Gillespie ,  2010).   The low barriers to entry required to achieve micro-celebrity status  n ot only  distinguish es  micro-celebrities from  mainstream celebrities, it demarcates them from  the top-down hierarchies that  characterise  the mainstream media .  In this regard, m icro-celebrity is conceived as part of the ‘demotic turn’ (Turner ,  2010), continuing the increasing visibility of 'ordinary' people i n the media facilitated by talk-back  radio  and  reality television in the late-twentieth century  (Hearn, 2008) ."
"29" "While in principle  social media  enable s  ordinary users to  be seen  a nd  heard,  micro-celebrity is  not inherently  a  democratis ing force.  D espite conjuring images of ‘the people’,  Graham Turner (2004) highlights that  the ‘demotic’ gives the appearance of democratic participation rather than providing equal opportunity for ordi nary citizens to achieve fame.  C elebrity still remains a ‘hierarchical and exclusive phenomenon, no matter how much it proliferates’ (Turner ,   2004:  93) ,  and  digital technologies can reinforce social  stratification around  race, class and gender  rather than  contesting  social inequalities  (Marwick ,  2013;   Duffy ,  2016) .   Researchers highlight  that the same  commercial and corporate hierarchies that  characterise  the mainstream media persist on these platforms ( Fuchs ,  2014 ).  M icro - celebritie s are  now  part of a  commercialis ed   production system.  T hey have more in common with  media  personalities than they do with  S enft’s   c amgirls  (Usher ,  2018:  15).  Moreover, d espite social media’s role in  giving  publicity and  momentum to  various protest movements  (e.g. # metoo ,  #BLM ) ,  the idea that micro-celebrity is  an  inherently  progressive force  has been subject to  criticisism  with micro-celebrity practices used to  spread health misinformation ( Baker, 2020a, 2020b; Baker and Rojek , 2019 , 2020 ) ,  anti-progressive  politics  (Lewis ,  2020)  and  far -right extremism (Marwick  and  Lewis ,  2017) .   This article  extend s  these critiques  by  demonstrating how   the  principles of wellness culture and  techniques of participatory culture have  been exploited  by  certain  users  during the pandemic  to  establish influence  in the  alternative  health  and wellness  space,  monetis e  conspiratorial thinking  and disseminate far-right ideologies ."
"30" "M icro-celebrities earn their followers’ trust by distancing themselves from institutional  media .  The  fact that these influential figures build their followings   in these supposedly democratic  online  spaces, in contrast to the mainstream media, feeds into their performative displays of authenticity and  autonomy –  their perception of being  outside of the system –  both of which are instr umental in their appearance as  trustworthy,  credible alternative s  to institutional authority  ( Baker and Rojek ,  2019 ) .   In the context of health,  social media  present s these users  as an alternative  source of knowledge  to mainstream science and medicine.  In so doing, they attract followers disillusioned with   institutionalis ed   politics and  public health  authorities ,  including  international health  organisations , government healthcare agencies and   pharmaceutical companies .   During the pandemic ,   alt. health influencers   employed  micro-celebrity practices to  appeal to  alternative health and  wellness groups to  promote conspiracy theories and  political  extremism.  In addition to hi ghlighting their autonomy from the system  they pu rport to critique, they engage in   performances   of   authentic ity   t o  connect  with their audiences .  For example, when asked how to navigate the pandemic, Stone reminded his audience to access their ‘authentic’ self:"
"31" "Authenticity is the key word here. Each of us who are serious about the question, how am I to navigate this pandemonium, this chaos, this apocalypse? How am I to navigate this turbulence this tribulation as an individual…? The only way to do it is if each of us step into our authenticity and start to really look at our own lives and strip away the fiction of our lives move back into that state of authenticity (Stone in Apollo, 2020)."
"32" "The implication being that Stone possesses the qualities of authenticity to which his audience aspire."
"33" "One of the affordances enabled by the shift from broadcast to participatory media is the capacity for micro-celebrities to establish direct relationships with  their audience . Instead of  communicating via  a n editor or  journalist, individual users can communicate directly with their followers, which gives the impression of accessibility.   Alt. health influencers  enact  the  appearance  of accessibility to  connect with their followers .   N utritional and spiritual guidance is shared in conjunction with persona lised  messages  to   t he i r f ollowers, whom they address as friends  and equals.  There are  reference s  to  their followers as  “ family ”, “folks”, “ friends ”, “us” and “we”, the use of inclusive pronouns  and the first person plural  bringing  t he i r audience into being as a united team   in their  pursuit of Truth . In addition to  purporting to reveal  the “Truth”,  alt. health influencers   discuss  “love” and “energy”,   encouraging  their  followers to  embark on  a  journey  of self-actualisation  as though  they  were a supportive frie nd providing them with comfort . They typically  sign off   their posts  with   hearts, kisses and  emoji s  to facilitate  the impression of intimate exchange .  These  performative displays  are  all  example s  of what Horton and   Wohl   (1956)  termed  ‘ para-social relationships ’ :  imaginary relationships audiences form with  media personalities  that   give the illusion of a face-to-face relationship  despite being   ‘ non-dialogical ’  and  ‘ one-sided ’ . Social media is  highly  effective in establishing para-social relationships of trust and intimacy because these online spaces are  ‘ structured  and communicated  as an exchange between equals ’ ( Baker and Rojek, 2020 ) . Through direct modes of communication, they create the impression of accessibility.  S elfies, blogs and vlogs  were   also  used by the influencers examined in this study   to create  a sense of familiarity  with  their followers.  Despite being highly curated,  content  of this kind create s  a feeling of intimacy through the perception of “backstage access” to  their personal lives  ( Abidin ,  2015 ) .   Importantly, thes e micro-celebrity practices  distinguish alt. health influencers  from the professional distance required of qualified doctors, therapists and medical professionals."
"34" "The  persecuted   hero : political positioning against the mainstream"
"35" "In addition to  using micro-celebrity techniques to foster  intimacy  and connection  with their followers,  alt. health   influencers use micro-celebrity practices to appear more trustworthy than  public  health  authorities .  Alt. health influencers  are  commonly  bound by a lack of trust in institutional authority.  In the context of health, d istrust is  typically  felt toward s  the government and mainstream medicine,  both of  which are perceived to be  compromised  by  vested   i nterests .   This  lack of institutional trust in mainstream politics, science and medicine extends towards a deep di s trust of the mainstream media. O ften referred to  pejoratively  as  ‘ MSM ’ , the mainstream media is portrayed as  biased ,   sensationalis ed  and corrupt .  In contrast to  journalism , which   has  traditionally  derived credibility from  institutional reputation and  ideal s  of objectivity  (Maras ,  2013) ,  influencers   do not proclaim to be neutral. Instead,  they  use  micro-celebrity practices to earn the trust of their followers  by positioning themselves as   friends and  equal s .  Micro-celebrity gives the impression of intimate exchange .  P ersonal confessions , inside scoops  and revelations  purporting to expose the Truth  are strategically used by influencers to  appear  more authentic   and trustworthy  than the mainstream media.  This is not because the media is  believed to be  ignorant t o these issues, but because the media   is  perceived to be instrumental in  concealing  the t ruth  from the public . Claims of this kind convey  the mainstream media  as  a  homogenous  group using COVID-19 to drive a  ‘ hidden agend a ’ ;  Evans asking his followers, ‘Could the main stream media be the one’s  spreading conspiracy theories?’ # mainstreammediaisthevirus   T he influencers  analysed  in this study  repeatedly  made reference to the “fake news”, “lies” , “fiction”  and “programming” perpetuated by the mainstream media as ways to dismiss mainstream journalism and those  commentators   critical of the  conspiratorial  content they share  online . In many  respects, these influencers are following the precedent set by former US P resident, Donald Trump, who uses  the term “fake news”  to descr ibe any content that contradicts  his messaging ( Hirst , 2017).  In this regard, social media is conceived as both an alternative to, and rejection of, the mainstream media. It enables these influencers to position themselves as  outside of  the  corrupt system  and mainstream narrative they critique .  As the pop-up on the homepage of Pete Evans’  (2021)  personal  website  explain s:"
"36" "We’re challenging the mainstream paradigm, to create a space to share vision and views, to create long term sustainable health solutions. To express without censorship and restriction. To allow freedom of speech and interest in ideas that  will allow humanity to evolve… Become pa rt of the solution ."
"37" "When interviewed on  Evan’s  (2020f)  podcast,  Sacha Stone , reiterated  this  poli tical positioning  against the mainstream :"
"38" "The beautiful thing is that people are now paying attention to alt. media voices and influencers and no longer paying attention to the mainstream narrative so much, so I think we are also on that beautiful fulcrum or pivot point of a reconvention with truth and with logic and with reason, which is coming again through grassroots through alternative pundits and journalists and researchers  and influencers, like yourself ."
"39" "T his  symbolic  positioning against the mainstream  is an intrinsic part of  how  alt. health   influencers  build a loyal online  audience .  Their  intentions may vary, but the  underlying  narrative   of the persecuted hero  is consistent:  1)  Society is controlled by  a secret group of  corrupt  elites ; 2)  Expose  this corruption  to so w a narrative of distrust about  institutionalised  authority;  3)  Depict  oneself as a  heroic  force for good  by revealing the  “Truth” , which  the mainstream media  purportedly  seek  to conceal  from the public ;  4)  U se  allegations  of censorship to imply that one is being  unjustly  vilified  for  speaking the Truth and  upholding principles, such as  Freedom  and Justice ;  5)  P resent oneself as a persecuted  hero  to establish a loyal online following  of people driven to  defen d these principles  and participate in a  global movement  and spiritual awakening ."
"40" "The persecuted hero narrative"
"41" "This same formula applies as much to lifestyle and wellness gurus  exposing the  corruption of the  pharmaceutical  industry   as it does to conspiracy theorists  exposing the Deep State’s  hidden agenda . It is one of the reasons  why  alternative health and wellness communities are susceptible to  conspiracy theories and  far right extremism.  The ir  subject matter may vary ,  but the  underlying  logic  of constructing an evil enemy and heroically seeking to restore Truth, Freedom  and Justice   is  remarkably  similar ."
"42" "The intersection between wellness culture, New Age spirituality and conspiracy theories"
"43" "Take, for example, the wellness  influencers  Pete Evans  and David Avocado Wolf e .   Both  have built successful businesses  online  disseminating wellness advice  and  healthy recipes  on their blogs and social media, which they monetise through podcasts, affiliate links, cookbooks,  meal plans,  “superfoods”, supplements ,  cleanses, detox programmes , essential oils ,   online courses  and wellness retreats .   Part of their appeal  as wellness gurus  is in offering   “natural” and organic  alternative s  to  mainstream products containing  additives,  GMOs , toxins  and  chemicals,  marketed as improving emotional, physical and spiritual  health  and well-being .  Evans and Wolf e  have promoted  controversial  health  products during the pandemic:  Evans selling  the ‘ BioC harger’  for $15,000AUD  to treat the “Wuhan coronavirus”  and  Wolfe selling  coated silver  for $150USD  a bottle ,  which ‘ u nder the  current level of flu threat ’,  he  recommends consumers   ‘ take 1 d rop of  Coated Silver with w ater daily’ ( Wolf e , 2020 d ) .   Both  i ntersperse wellness advice with conspiratorial content about nefarious governments and public health authorities seeking to control the population .   Conspiracist ideation   is endemic to wellness culture with  less controversial wellness influencers, such as  the self-proclaimed ‘Wellness Advocate’ , Therese Kerr,  sharing   her  fears on Instagram that Bill Gates and Dr Anthony Fauci  plan to run a ‘Brave New World’;   claiming that  Gates  seeks  to vaccinate people with microchips for surveillance and transhumanism using #5G. Claims of this kind appear on her Instagram profile alongside posts featuring empowering quotes by Ram Dass and photographs of organic smoothies, chia puddings and salad bowls.   Evans  and Wolfe similarly combine   generic wellness  posts promoting  ‘Im mune System Tips and Strategies’ ,  longevity   and  dietary advice  together  with false and misleading claims about  5G, mask-wearing, vaccines and  the severity of the virus.   H ealth m isinformation of this kind seeks to undermine  the legitimacy of public health  authorities  by  invoking claims of  scientis m   to   accuse  elites  of using  science  to silence  voices that deviate   from the mainstream narrative :"
"44" "🛃 The elite (control freaks) of the world are using the tyranny of scientism to attack our freedoms worldwide. Scientism is a collection of pseudoscientific materialistic belief systems that attempt to circumvent The Scientific Method by using catch phrases such as “scientific consensus” and “settled science” and calling everybody else “pseudoscientists” and “anti-science” — all in the spirit of shaming those who oppose their theories, sold to us as “facts” and “science” … The track record of mainstream medicine being the 3rd leading cause of death for 18 years straight running in the United States and providing non-stop doomsday reports to innocent people should immediately cause us to stop believing in ANY supposed “medical professional”.  👎   (Wolfe, 2020 b )"
"45" "Part of the reason that  Wolfe’s  attack of medical professionals  is able  to sew a narrative of distrust about the legitimacy of  these elites  is because he is speaking to an audience largely disillusioned with mainstream science and medicine .   Distrust of medical experts, pharmaceutical corporations and the food industry has encouraged people to seek alternative  health  solutions . It enables these influencers to position themselves as alt. health  influencers  espousing  “ the Truth ”  to their followers   while   advising  them  how to  “awaken”, “evolve ”  and lead a  “ better ”  life . It is why Wolfe’s posts about ‘8 AMAZING DETOX INGREDIENTS YOU CAN ADD TO WATER’ , ‘8  PROBIOTIC FOODS  (TO)  IMPROVE DIGESTION, REDUCE DEPRESSION AND PROMOTE HEART HEALTH!’  and ‘GINGER VEGGIE WRAPS WITH LEMON TAHINI’ ,   Brogan ’s ‘5 Rules  For  Eating Away Your Depression’  and  Evan’s paleo recipes  are able to sit alongside anti-lockdown, anti-mask and anti-vaccine messaging.  Their followers are largely distrusting of  public health authorities   and look to   these influencers   to provide   credible and  trustworthy advice on  how to achieve  spiritual ,  nutritional and emotional well-being."
"46" "Although  some  of the   posts  shared by alt. h eal th i nfluencers  are controversial, the majority of information  they   disseminate   online  draws on  common sense  knowledge , folk wisdom and  lived  experience .  They espouse a back to basics approach which privileges the body and intuitive thinking.  Brogan  (2021)  highlights the importance of  ‘trusting our bodies’ ,  Evans  (2020a)  encourages his followers to ‘trust your intuition’ , Wolfe  (2020c)  informs his followers to  ‘ Use your in stincts and intuition’  and Stone   reminds his audience  that we are born with the capacity to ‘intuit’:  ‘If you want to get to truth, to the real throne of self, get into the gut’  (Stone in Apollo, 2020) .  An integral part of  their  discourse is that  State and corporate interes ts are contrary to the  natural , embodied wisdom   they  promote . As Wolfe  (2020a)  explains :"
"47" "Corporate Media is not useful and is not wise. Please get back into Nature and experience this Wisdom... 💦 Drink water from the spring where the horse drinks...  😴 Go to sleep and wake up with the chickens and you will reap the golden grain of the day. 🥗Eat more green vegetables, and you will have st rong legs and an enduring heart ."
"48" "Stone   employs  a similar type of messaging :"
"49" "Start to  re - engender  a  relationship with the trees, with  the flowers, with the running water, with the clouds . S tart to re - engage at the elemental level  with who you are and what you be in the now that’s how you navigate out of the apocalypse  (Stone in Apollo, 2020)."
"50" "By  aligning themselves with what is natural and  ‘pure’,   untainted by  greed  and  corporate  corruption ,   alt. health influencers  are able to position themselves  as  more   enlightened   than the general public  and therefore able to help  their followers  to  “see the light”   as they  embark on a personal journey of self-actualisation and spiritual awakening .   In this regard,  alt. health  influencers  are conforming to the same marketing logic described by Ward and Voas’s  (2011)  concept,   ‘ conspirituality ’ : the belief that  a secret group covertly controls the social and political order and  that   humanity ‘ is undergoing a “paradigm shift” in consciousness’ .  What is new is how  these  internet users  exploit the participatory dynamics of web culture  to  s elf-brand as micro-celebrities  and build an online following . W ith social media companies ,  such as Instagram ,  in their nascency when the term ‘conspirituality’ was coined, the term does not take account of the  capacity for the participatory culture   of the internet to facilitate  mis-and disinformation.  S ocial media affords these micro-celebrities access to global public audiences and the capacity to cross-pollinate their ideas in like-minded communities  online .  These  technologies  also  enable  conspiritual content to  be produced and shared  online  at an unprecede nted speed and scale with  attempts  by  governments and tech companies to limit the spread of misinformation via content moderation  often assisting  these  influencers   in  build ing  and sustain ing  a loyal online  following ."
"51" "Many of the influencers  examined  in this study had their posts   or accounts  removed from YouTube, Instagram, Facebook and Twitter for violating their COVID-19 misinformation policies .  Alt. health i nfluencers  typically respond to content moderation by  claim ing   that  their voices are   “censored” for  deviating from  the mainstream narrative.   Claims of censorship, suspensions  and shadow banning  on social media are  then  used as evidence that the major technology companies are trying to suppress information and control the population.   Following his suspension on Facebook, Stone   described   the company’s community guidelines   as   ‘totalitarian edicts’ ,   ‘ forcing consensus ’  and  ‘ mutating the truth at all costs’  (Stone, 2021 a ) .  Wolfe  (2020a) similarly warning , ‘I’m telling you that IG, FB and all these social media platforms are descending into censorship, control and power struggles’."
"52" "Accusations  of censorship  are crucial to the self-branding of alt. health influencers .  Each time  their  controversial post s are removed from social media,  it frames  those   alleging to be  censored   as beacons of Freedom  and  Truth   for  defending freedom of speech and  daring to question the “mainstream narrative” . In  an  interview  filmed during the pandemic entitled,  Freedom and Truth with Sacha Stone ,   Stone is introduced as an ‘activator of truth consciousness’ , to which he replies :"
"53" "I’m glad you emphasising t ruth because that  is... the  creature that is  being harmed the most right now at every level of our matrix model that the greatest casualty is pure truth (Stone in Apollo, 2020)."
"54" "In this regard, t he  i nformation war is framed as  part of  a greater  cosmic battle between good and evil .  These concerns are visually expressed in a series of  videos and   memes ,  which  use  evocative  imagery and  satire  to compare tech companies  to  authoritarian regimes, such as,   “Stasis”, “Nazis” and “fascists” . For example,  following his suspension from Facebook,  Evans   shared  a meme  on Instagram  featuring   the CEOs of Facebook and Twitter, Mark  Zuck erberg  and  Jack  Dorsey , dressed as Nazi soldiers with Facebook and Twitter  armbands   on  the ir  uniform .   Stone  regularly  refers to  the major tech companies  as the ‘Google gestapo’   and the ‘YouTube censors’ .  In this regard, the  harm policies  introduc ed by mainstream social media platforms to combat the spread of misinformation  related to   COVID-19   symbolically fuse s   the major  tech  companies with the mainstream media  as a common enemy  of  Truth and Freedom . As a result, many influencers  use  these platforms , and the micro-celebrity practices they afford,  to build  large  audiences ,  which they then direct towards personal websites and less regulated  platforms, such as Gab, Parler , MEWE  and Telegram.  Pete Evans  (202 1 )   regularly  leads  his  Instagram  followers  to his  channel ,  Evolve Network , for ‘uncensored information’;  David Avocado Wolfe urges his followers  to  download Telegram – ‘one of the last bastions of Freedom’ – or to  visit his website for ‘Uncensored’ and ‘Unfiltered’ information with ‘No Algorithm’   (Wolfe, 2020 a )   and K elly Brogan (2020b) i nvites  her followers to Telegram to avoid ‘social engineering’ and  ‘medical tyranny’ .   B y  depicting themselves as unjustly persecuted for heroically upholding principles of   Truth and  Freedom ,   alt. health  influencers are able to  exploit  content moderation  to  create a community of loyal followers willing to defend these  fundamental  belief system s ."
"55" "G am ification :  calls to participate  in  the journey"
"56" "T he p articipatory affordances of  social media   facilitate brand loyalty by encouraging  users to  invest emotionally  in the  issues and  individuals they are exposed to online .   One of the key affordances of social media is that  it  enable s  direct modes of communication  between  influencers  and their followers . Communication may not be reciprocated, yet the appearance of accessibility  creates a  feeling of proximity and intimate exchange.   Lifestyle and wellness influencers typically use the appearance of accessibility to call on their followers to participate in a ‘journey’ of self-transformation , self-discovery  and spiritual awakening ( Baker and Rojek , 2019). This includes taking  ‘the decisive act’ to ‘reset’  their lives through a conscious reversal of poor die t and lifestyle , and negative thinking  ( Baker and Rojek , 2020) .  Embarking on  the journey  also involves finding a  worthy guru to  be their guide.   The underlying messaging of self-development and self-actualisation resonates with the neo-liberal ethos of personal responsibility: y ou can choose to awaken; you can choose to be free.  W ellness  discourse   assumes an overtly moral undertone   as exemplified by  the symbolic  idealis ation of certain foods as ‘pure’ and others as ‘impure’ and defiled ( Baker and Walsh, 2018,  2020) . Devotees eschew toxins,   ‘nasty chemicals’  an d an  unhealthy diet   in favour  of clean eating and a healthy lifestyle. M uch of  the  underlying  messaging  of wellness culture  also  centres around  the injustices perpetuated by  institutional health authorities, especially with regard to  vaccines and Big Pharma ."
"57" "Justice is  similarly  a powerful mobilising force used by alt. health influencers to build and sustain a loyal online following.   Sacha Stone  and David Avocado Wolfe   explicitly self-brand as  advocate s  for justice  ( Wolfe and Stone, 2021).   Stone’ s personal website describes him as ‘an outspoken advocate of hum an rights and natural justice’ . He has founded many organisations, most of which explicitly align themselves with justice, including Humanitad, New Earth Project and the International Tribunal for Natural  Justice (ITNJ); which launched  Judicial Commission s  of Inquiry into ‘Human Trafficking and Child Sex Abuse’ and into the ‘Weaponisation of the Biosphere’. By self-branding as an advocate for environmental and criminal justice, Stone is able to attract followers driven to protect innocent children and the environment. A similar strategy was employed by QAnon in  mid- 2020 when the movement hijacked the ‘Save the Children’ hashtags on social media and in person protests to broaden their public appeal.  The  QAnon  conspiracy  highlights how  the participatory dynamics of web culture  have been exploited  to attract individuals embarking on a journey of personal responsibility to feel a sense of agency as collaborators  working towards  a collective endeavour.   The mode of communication characteristic of QAnon is inherently participatory. Cryptic messages are left by an anonymous user called Q, a pseudonym employed by a person claiming to be a high-level US military intelligence official.   Q’s followers  wait for posts (“Q drops”) that contain clues, which they actively dissect and decode into a meaningful narrative, collaboratively working together in their perceived fight for Truth, Justice and Spiritual Awakening."
"58" "One of the reasons that QAnon conspiracy theories are so effective is because they involve a process of gamification. Gamification is ‘the use of game design elements in non-game contexts’ (Deterding et al .,  2011). Akin to playing a video game, individuals become invested in the story via ludic participation. Users are rewarded for actively detecting and decoding the symbols that comprise the narrative like pieces of a puzzle. This process of ‘playful interaction’ is afforded by the participatory dynamics of social media. Followers are invited to  embark on a journey  of self-discovery via references to taking the “red pill”, “following the white rabbit” and “doing their own research”.  G amification was evident on the accounts examined in this study.  Pete Evans (2020b)  asks  his followers on Instagram, ‘Who want s to go down the rabbit hole?’,  encouraging  them  to ‘keep joining the dots’ and  join him ‘as we go deeper’ in a post featuring a white rabbit (Evans, 2020c).  There are  reference s  to the Matrix  –  ‘Wake up Neo…’  (Evans, 2020d)  –  and  questions about whether  his  followers have  ‘red pilled ’   their  friends and family (Evans, 2020e );   Brogan  (2020a)  sharing a video  on Instagram  describing  t he 'Red Pill' as a movement designed to reclaim our ‘power’ and ‘feel for  our own truth’ .   Consequently,  although  the alt. health influencers examined in this study did not explicitly endorse QAnon, they integrated QAnon’s symbolic codes in their messaging. The in vitation to participate in the journey  is  further  expressed on their websites.  Brogan  invites her followers to  join her online membership community,  Vital Life Project, for ‘health reclamation’ ,  Wolfe invites his followers to join his ‘inner circle experience’,  Evans invites his followers to ‘Become part o f the solution’   and Stone summons his followers to ‘Arise Homosapiens !’   T he journey towards  sovereignty and  self-actualisation  is depicted  as a  personal  choice , yet  their messaging  simultaneously succumb s  to a type of fatalism  that  presents  our actions  as  part of a pre-ordained plan  waiting to unfold :   ‘ ✨ 🥑 ✨ Buckle up folks.  Truths are getting Unsealed… Today is The Best Day Ever!!  ✨ 🥑 ✨ ’ (Wolfe, 2020 c ); ‘ Someone pass the popcorn please I'm not leaving my seat!  💥 ’   (Stone,  2020b ) , ‘ Everyday  more and more is coming to light.  ❤ 🦄🐇   🌈 ’  (Evans,  2020 g )."
"59" "There is  a strong  parallel here  between  the ways in which wellness  influencers  and  alt. health influencers   construct their personas online. While wellness influencers typically base their credentials on a heroic narrative of self-transformation from a state of pain and misery to one of success and well-being  (Baker and Rojek, 2019) , alt. health influencers are using the pandemic to depict their moral authority. Instead of extolling their virtues though clean eating and eschewing so-called “dirty” foods, their moral virtue is manifest in their  “global detox” of the Deep State  and other powerful elites, which is integrated into a compelling narrative of a heroic individual motivated to cleanse  the world of injustice and evil;  Brogan  (2020c) , who sells ‘The Vital Mind Reset Program’, explaining,  ‘We are, now, in a spiritual war, and your body is the battlefield’.  Just as today’s lifestyle  and wellness  gurus take ‘the decisive act’ to ‘reset’  their lives through a conscious reversal of negative thinking  ( Baker and Rojek , 2020) , those who have used the current pandemic to spread conspiratorial thinking commonly talk of “waking up” and being “red pilled” to describe their personal enlightenment. This metaphor implies that non-believers are asleep  – referred to pejoratively as  “normies” , “sheep”  or “muggles”.  In this context, influencers spreading conspiracy theories often refer to themselves as ‘Truthers’ (Richey, 2017) ,  spreading  what Stone describes as  ‘pure T ruth ’  to their followers ."
"60" "By drawing public awareness to the injustices perpetuated by evil elites,  alt. health influencers  give their followers a reason to believe in their cause and  embark on a  journey of  personal  awakening. Influencers may publicly reject their guru status, but despite their disavowals ,  their self-branding as wellness and spiritual elites presents them as having  privileged  access to  secret  knowledge and being in   ‘service of raising awareness and consciousness’ (Stone,  2021b )  from darkness to light , which they often monetise through podcasts, products, books and wellness retreats. By aligning themselves with what is Just and True,  alt. health influencers  establish their authority  as guides  in their followers’ journey towards spiritual ascension.  This  hero  motif of responding to a higher calling and embarking on a spiritual journey  is one of the reasons that so many alt. health influencers  were able to publicly endorse  former US President, Donald Trump, during the  2020  US Presidential Election  without undermining their brand . Trump’s anti-establishment rhetoric, his irreverence for institutional authority and promise to “Make America Great Again” resonates with their  anti-establishment   ethos  and desire to enact a  “ better ”   body,  self and society ;   Wolfe   claiming  that ‘the only thing between us and total tyranny is,  strangely enough, Donald Trump’   and  Stone  (2020a)  encouraging   his followers to vote for Trump in the 2020 US Presidential Election  to  ‘ help the eradication of human trafficking, mainstream media cult-programming, censorship, pedo philia and high-street S atanism’ .   While Wolfe , Stone  and Evans  publicly endorse Trump,  Stone  conveys a particularly  authoritarian view of the world.  In an interview entitled,  Who  runs the World?   (2021), Stone  describes Russian President, Vladimir Putin, as ‘the greatest political hero today’ ,   declaring that Trump ‘will help America ns to awaken from their dream’  (Stone in Lel, 2021) .  Invoking   spiritual  language of resurrection, ascension and  awakening , Stone  prophesise s  that Trump  and Putin  will liberate humanity, framing his  anti-globalist  narrative as a battle between  ‘good, light, benevolent forces’  against the globalis t Satanic, Deep State Sabbatean  elites."
"61" "What is overlooked in these  generic  wellness  references to “love and light” are the  darker,  exclusionary practices  used  by alt. health influencers  to  promote a type of illiberal,  far-right politics.   Despite using micro-celebrity practices to present themselves as friends and equals, t he rhetoric put forward by Stone, Evans and Wolfe highlights how easily the epistemic absolutism of wellness and spiritual  culture  can  merge with web culture to  facilitate authoritarian ism .   Participants may be  encouraged  to “do their own research”, but t he process of me aning making that underpins their   journey  is absolute. Coincidences are never coincidences and even incongruous information or predictions that turn out to be false are described as part of “the plan”. In addition to helping these influencers build and sustain an online following,  the  participatory dynamics  of social media   act as a  call to action with  the influencers examined in this study encouraging their followers to resist government coronavirus guidelines ,  refuse vaccine s,  quarantine,  masks and social distancing;  Sto ne  signing off his Instagram posts with the phrase, ‘Arise Sapiens!’   The irony is that in critiquing institutional authority, these  alt. health influencers  often seek to become authorities, using performative displays of  autonomy,  authenticity , accessibility  on social media  to promote a type of  authoritarianism and  spiritual elitism .  The exclusionary politics endorsed by these alt. health influencers   reveals that  the democratic potential of social media to decentraliase power and facilitate online participation  paradoxically  has  the  potential to enable  ‘charismatic, personality-centered modes of  authoritarianism’ in which the expression of individuality online can serve authoritarian ends (Turner, 2018: 144)."
"62" "From a public health perspective , there are other concerning consequences of  the influence exercised by  alt. health influencers in the context of COVID-19.   Researchers   can   assess   the power of  alt. health influencers  online  by analysing  engagement (e.g. likes, shares, comments) and mapping  how  they  produce and amplify false or misleading advice . W hat  remains unknown  is what happens offline . Did their posts change someone’s mind about government  COVID-19  guidelines?   H ow many  of their  followers experience d  serious illness  or death  as a consequence of  following their content and  defying public health advice?   These issues are  accentuated  by the fact that alt. health influencers tend to be white and middle class, statistically less vulnerable to the virus than certain  socio-economic and ethnic  groups  ( Boseley  and Mohdin, 2021 ) . Most have  the means to support themselves sh ould they become seriously ill.  These considerations make the influence  that  alt. health influencers wield   socially  significant . As individual internet users these micro-celebrities may occupy the same online spaces as their followers, but what this  symbolic positioning  obscures are the  structural inequalities  that distinguish  alt. health influencers  from their followers ."
"63" "Conclusion"
"64" "In this article  I have  explored how wellness  culture  and web culture have  been weaponised   by certain  internet  users  during  the pandemic to  self-brand as alt. health  influencers. Analysing the Instagram posts of four  alt. health  influencers  over a 12-month period , I note   three key  techniques   they  use  to  achiev e   visibility and  status online.  First,  alt. health influencers  use  micro-celebrity  to foster  trust and  intimacy  with their followers .  Second, b y  presenting themselves as unjustly “censored”   by   the  mainstream   media  and institutional authorities ,  alt. health influencers  depict  themselves as persecuted  heroes   uphold ing  T ruth,  F reedom   and J ustice .  Third, they exploit  the participatory affordance s of social media  to  mobilise  followers  willing to defend these principles  through a  ludic  journey of  self-discovery  to give  the illusion  of agency  and collaboration in the fight against  evil ."
"65" "These findings make  several  significant contributions to  the study of  culture  and society . First, t hey  build on critiques  questioning the democratising effects of  web culture   by  examining  how  these  technologies   have been used to spread conspiracy theories and political extremism during  the pandemic.   While  social media can be used to expose corruption and oppression by giving publicity and momentum to minority views, it  can also  be used to facilitate  political extremism (Marwick and Lewis ,  2017;  Lewis ,  2020) and  ‘charismatic, personality-centered modes of authoritarianism’ (Turner ,  2018: 144) .   T his study also  provides insights into  the ways in which wellness culture has been used to undermine  public health messaging. Social media companies sought to combat misinformation about COVID-19 by updating their harm policies and elevating  ‘ authoritative content ’   from  government healthcare agencies ( Baker et  al . ,  2020 ). One of the primary ways  alt. health influencers establish authority in the wellness space is by  critiquing the  mainstream media,  politics,  science and medicine. Their  micro-celebrity status on  social media is not simply presented as an  alternative to the mainstream media, but a rejection of  it;  ‘challenging the mainstream paradigm’  in all its forms  (Evans, 2021 ) . This  is why  the current approach used by g overnments and technology companies to elevate  authoritative content  on social media  during the pandemic  is unlikely to be effective in targeting  their followers .  Alt. health influencers   strategically target   wellness communities  by  appealing to  their di strust of the government  and their interest in pursuing alternative health  solutions .  While wellness culture is characterised by personalised solutions, independent thinking, truth–seeking and alternative beliefs and practices, it is these very preoccupations that  alt. health influencers have  weaponised  to  promote conspiratorial thinking and  far-right  politics .   Paradoxically, a movement originally intended to empower marginalised groups risks disempowering those already disproportionately at risk of severe illness from the virus."
