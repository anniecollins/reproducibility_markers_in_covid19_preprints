Abstract
This study examined routine activities reported in a survey sample of 4,600 adult
Canadians aged 15 years old and over during the COVID-19 confinement period of May
4-10, 2020 and collected by Statistics Canada. A marketing segmentation analysis was
carried out using a roster of 26 typical weekly activity items leading to the extraction of
typical activity patterns and the identification of six major segments present in the
Canadian adult population: "Hygienists" (25%), "Caregivers"(14%), "Sound Body Minders"
(23%), "Home-centric" (19%), "Media-centric" (9%) and "Oblivious" (10%). Weekly
activities included a wide range of actions such as washing hands, avoiding crowds,
watching T.V., internet browsing, exercising, alcohol consumption and others. The six
population segments were identified using a combination of principal component and kmeans cluster statistical analysis. Marketing segmentation is a useful tool for decision
makers to categorize population members and, by doing so, facilitate better public
campaigns, help design messages and implement changes that can promote more
efficient ways to deal with the various societal consequences of the COVID-19
confinement.
The segment mottos for the six segments can be summarized as follows: "Clean, Clean,
Clean"; "People First!", "Sound body, Sound mind!", "My Home is my Fortress", "I Love
Being Plugged" and "Pandemic? What Pandemic?". Hygienists were the most observant of
safety guidelines while Caregivers and Sound Body Minders tolerated this environment
in order to take care of others and/or promote personal care. Home-centrics were
"anchored" to their homes and Media-centrics to their computer, internet and social
media. Oblivious carried out their routine activities as if the pandemic never happened
and were somewhat negligent of safety guidelines. Members of these two last clusters
are particularly challenging and harder to reach by health authorities and institutions.
Media-centrics are problematic in terms of reported mental health issues while Oblivious
segment members in terms of their negligence in following the enacted sanitary
guidelines. Appropriate messages need to be tailored to reach these types of audiences in
order to promote the well-being and safety of Canadians at this juncture.

The author would like to thank Stein Monteiro, Jennifer Domouilan, the Ontario Data Documentation,
Extraction Service and Infrastructure (ODESI-Scholars Portal Statistics) as well as Statistics Canada for
making available the data and valuable support and guidance.

1.0. Background
The COVID‐19 virus has caused major disruptions across the world, after being declared as a
pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 31st January 2020 (WHO, 2020). This
pandemic has led to a break with ordinary routine activities and social contacts for most of the
world's population. Canada is presently undergoing the so-called "second" phase. As of
October 25, 2020, there had been a total of 9,946 deaths attributed to the coronavirus in
Canada 2 . A larger number is expected in the coming months. Most of the reported cases
are in Canada's two most populous provinces, Ontario and Quebec, which have declared
different sanitary measures to deal with the virus spread in the population.
Under the strict rules of the COVID-19 confinement environment, Canadians carry on
various daily activities which help them to ensure personal well-being, perform social
roles, leisure and cope with the stress of the shifting nature of interpersonal relations
(see Lazarus, 1986; Kelly, 2019). These routine activities provide a sense of meaning to
life and personal efficacy. Some individuals direct their efforts to activities which follow
sanitary recommendations such as hand washing, keeping physical distance and
avoiding crowds. Others direct their efforts to doing more outdoor or indoor exercises as
well reading, writing and/or game playing. Browsing the interest has now become a
favourite activity among Canadians.
Market segments are groups of individuals who are similar in their reaction to one or more
mix of environmental elements (Grover and Briens, 2006). Communalities in terms of routine
activities define various possible market segments which can be targeted by public health
campaigns aimed at promoting and/or discouraging particular behaviours. Using a sample of
the adult population of Canada, the central objectives of the marketing segmentation analysis
presented here is to break down the population into meaningful clusters of individuals
(homogeneous) in terms of the typical routine activities carried out during the COVID-19
pandemic. Three central questions guided the segmentation analysis: 1) What weekly
activities are the most reported by Canadians during the pandemic? 2) Can groups of
individuals be differentiated into segments or clusters according to these activities? and
3) What are the typical socio-demographic, residential, employment and psychosocial
characteristics of the members of these segments?. The CPSS-Series2 survey conducted
by Statistics Canada was the ideal data source chosen to empirically explore these three
central research questions.
2.0.Sample and Measures
The CPSS-Series 2 survey (CPSS Series2) is an online survey that collected
information on the knowledge and behaviours of 4,600 Canadians aged 15 years old
and over residents of the 10 Canadian provinces. It was administered by Statistics
Canada between May 4-10, 2020 (the reference week). The probability panel of the
CPSS-Series2 was created by randomly selecting a subset of the Labour Force
Survey (LFS) respondents. It collected a wide range of information on Activities for
health, COVID-19, behaviours, delivery services, drugs, employment, Employment
insurance (EI) benefits, food security, physical health and mental health, health
impacts, information on COVID-19, grocery, labour market impacts, precautions,

shopping, social distancing, telework and other habits 3.
The routine activity items comprised a set of 26 questions related to the frequency of
weekly activities carried out during the reference week. Items were measured as
dichotomous scales(0=no, 1=yes). These items were captured by three types of questions:
1) Which of the following precautions (list shown) have you taken to reduce your risk of
exposure to COVID-19? 2)Are you doing any of the following activities (list shown) for
your health? and Have your weekly habits (list shown) changed for any of the following
activities?. The list of weekly activities ranked by their frequency (average %) is presented
in table 1.
3.0.Statistical Methods and Segment Identification
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and k-means cluster analysis were used as the main
statistical techniques for segment identification (see detail of the methodologies followed in
Punj and Stewart (1983), Grover and Vriens (2006) and Salkind and Rasmussen (2010). In the
first phase, Principal Components (statistical technique aimed at data reduction) extracted 8
major dimensions underlying information on the 26 dichotomous activity related items. In the
second phase and using component scores of these dimensions capturing about half of the
total data variation (47%), k-means clustering analysis was applied to the CPSS-Series data.
This clustering algorithm was developed to sort survey respondents into a k number of
clusters through assignments and re-assignments based on the shortest distance between the
individual and the centroid (mass centre) of the cluster. The distance measure chosen for this
purpose was the Euclidean distance squared. For the cluster, analysis k=2 to k=8 solutions
were tested. The k=6 solution proved to be the most valid and informative according to the
parsimonious reduction of the Within Sum of Squares (WSS) and the application of the "elbow"
criteria as a stopping rule in the partition of clusters (see technical appendix chart A-1). The
validation of the partition of the population into six clusters was verified using Analysis of
Variance (ANOVA) F tests where the cluster membership was used in the prediction of the
socio-demographic and attitudinal characteristics of respondents (see table A-2) in the
technical appendix. The highest predicted power of the cluster partition was found in reference
to the telework status characteristics of respondents (19% of variance explained).

Statistics Canada has already released major findings of the CPSS-Series1 and CPSS-3 surveys (conducted
between March 29-April 3 and June15-21,2020 respectively), which include: greater anxieties over personal
health and the health of others, that most Canadians were following health guidelines, greater time spent on
the internet and watching television, women stricter in terms of following guidelines than males and youth less
likely to wear masks in public. Sources : 1) https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/dailyquotidien/200408/dq200408c-eng.htm; 2) https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/dailyquotidien/200708/dq200708a-eng.htm.

4.0. Findings
4.0. Segment Prevalence and Traits
According to the cluster analysis of the CPSS-Series 2 data, six uniquely profiled groups of the
Canadian adult population respondents were identified. Their membership was distributed as
follows: 25% in segment 1, 14% in segment 2, 23% in segment 3, 19% in segment 4, 9% in
segment 5 and 10% in segment 6. Based on the typical activity profiles drawn from the 26
dichotomous scales, the segments were labeled as follows: Segment 1 – "Hygienists", Segment
2-"Caregivers", Segment 3-"Sound Body Minders", Segment 4-"Home-centric", Segment 5"Media-centric" and Segment 6-"Oblivious". The prevalence 4 of segments in the Canadian
adult population is presented in pie chart 1.
A visual representation (PCA bi-plot) of the vector of activities and dimensions underlying the
data are displayed in chart 2. The first two components extracted by PCA accounted for
20.2% of the variance of all activity items. The first dimension represented by C1 (11.5%
of the total variance of items) opposes as polar cases Caregivers vs. Oblivious segment
members in terms of their behaviour revealing different orientations in terms of adherence
of safety protocols. The second dimension, represented by C2 (8.7% of the total variance
of items), opposes Hygienists vs. Media-Centric as polar cases. It reveals behaviours
which fundamentally differ in terms of attachment to technology and media practices (i.e.
watching T.V. and spending more time in the internet) as well the level of some
unintended outcomes of the confinement such as more tobacco and/or cannabis use.
Statistical Note: In the Chart 2 bi-plot, the first two principal components extracted from the
data (C1 and C2) are shown. These accounted for 20.2% of the total variation of the 26
dichotomous items representing all weekly activities. They are the most fundamental
dimensions summarizing the activity patterns reported by respondents. In the biplot, vectors
represent items which are presented as points in space. The bi-plot of the second component
on the first component is useful as it displays the correlations of variables in terms of various
item vectors of different magnitudes, directions and positions. Proximity of activity traits to
group positions in space suggests an over-representation of these traits with respect to the
composition of groups while greater distances suggests its converse. Correlations between two
indicator variables in component space are equal to the cosines of the angles between the
indicator vectors (θ), or r = cos(θ). Highly correlated variables are located at sharp angles from
each other (θ =90 degrees or less) while those zero correlated are "orthogonal" to each other (θ
=90 degrees). If variables are perfectly negatively correlated, then θ=360 degrees (vector in
opposite direction).

4.2. Segment Profile Summaries: Who Are they?
The following are the summary descriptions of the market segments found in the CPSSSeries2 data:
Segment 1 – Hygienists (25% representing 8.3 million adult Canadians), Segment
Motto: "Clean, Clean, Clean!"
One out of four adult Canadians are part of this cluster of individuals. Members are
significantly differentiated by their strict adherence to hygiene principles and meticulous
practice of government safety guidelines. They are "exemplary" models of sanitary
behaviour. More than 90% washed hands, distanced from public, avoided crowds and
avoided leaving their homes. Hygienists were fastidious about sanitary conditions mainly
because only 4% worked from home. They were not completely immune from the
unintended consequences of confinement such as eating more junk food or sweets (38%)
and/or watching television (85%) compared to previous weeks. Over-representation of
females (54%) and married and common law marital status individuals (64%) are
observable in this segment. Hygienists are the least educated segment of the six: almost
half of them had an equivalent of high school or below education (49%). Only 17% of
Hygienists reported average moderate or severe levels of generalized anxiety in the
COVID-19 environment.
Segment 2 – Caregivers (14% representing 4.9 Million adult Canadians), Segment
Motto: "People first!"
Members of this segment react to the pandemic environment displaying notable
altruistic or other-oriented behaviour. For them, coping with the pandemic means
taking care of others. About 73% made plans to care for non-household members and
61% for household ones. One in three did meditation as a spiritual practice during the
reference week (34%). Like hygienists, they also strongly adhered to safety guideline
principles particularly in the areas of stocking up on essentials (82%) and the filling of
prescriptions (58%). About 60% reported an increase in T.V. watching. Women are overrepresented in the caregivers segment (55%) and also about 72% of them reported
married and common law marital status. One out of four (25%) reported moderate or
severe levels of generalized anxiety in the COVID-19 environment.
Segment 3 – Sound Body Minders (23% representing 6.8 million adult Canadians).
Segment Motto:"Sound Body, Sound Mind!"
Sound Body Minders are individuals whose routine activities adhere to safety guidelines
but, in addition, adopt personal practices leading to healthier physical and conditions
About 72% exercised outdoors while 47% did so indoors. The most notable behavioral
feature, however, is that Sound Body Minders "avoided" potentially negative
consequences of confinement such as an increase in T.V. watching (only 13%) and/or
consuming more alcohol (only 8%). Over-representation of older individuals 65+ years
old (32%) as well as males (53%) are observable in this segment. Sound Body Minders
exhibit the lowest levels of moderate or severe anxiety levels of all six segments (9%).

9

Segment 4 – Home-centric (19% representing 5.8 million adult Canadians).
Segment Motto: "My Home is my Fortress!"
Members of this young segment pay special attention to perform home-focused related
activities which bring to them a sense of comfort and security. About 77% of Homecentrics were currently employed and 90% were working from home during the
pandemic. They also exercised outdoors (83%), spent more time on the internet (86%)
and increased their frequency of playing board games (49%). It is the most educated
segment of the six segments: 44% achieved average education equivalent to university
beyond the bachelor level. Like the Media-centric group, it has an over-representation of
younger individuals (52% of them were 35 years old or younger) and had a younger child
living in the household with them (46%). Close to one in five Home-centrics were foreignborn (17%). In terms of psychosocial characteristics, about 13% of Home-centrics
reported moderate or severe levels of generalized anxiety during the pandemic.
Segment 5 – Media-centric (9% representing 2.6 million Canadians). Segment
Motto: "I Love Being Plugged!"
Individuals called Media-centrics represent a special young population segment which
heavily use technology and social media to cope with the CODID-19 environment in
Canada. They are the most technology "plugged" the segments. Although they appear to
be somewhat complying with safety guidelines like the members of the other segments,
they also report a greater increase in spending more time in the internet (87%), watching
T.V. (81%) and playing video games (55%). By the time of the survey, about 42% had
made assistance applications such as the CERB program, Employment Insurance
and/or other benefits. Compared to other segments, they reported an increase in alcohol
consumption (55%), tobacco products (50%) and particularly cannabis (65%). About half
of Media-centrics are under 34 years old and 48% are also single. A strong attachment
to media is correlated with some types of mental health -related pathologies as their
members reported the highest moderate and/or severe level of generalized anxiety of all
segments (43%). Also, almost half of them (49%) reported poor or fair levels of mental
health.
Segment 6 – Oblivious (10% representing 2.7 million adult Canadians). Segment
Motto: "Pandemic? What Pandemic?"
Members of the Oblivious segment are almost the polar opposite to Hygienists. Their
members constitute, perhaps, central targets for messages to be sent by health
authorities in Canada. They carry out their daily activity routines as if the pandemic
never happened and are somewhat "sloppy" with regards to following the imposed
health guidelines. In contrast to other segments, about half of them washed hands
regularly (52%), only 37% avoided crowds and large gatherings while only 47% kept
physical distancing in public. Only 35% reported stocking up on essentials. They were
also not immune to an increase in T.V. watching (40%) although 45% of them exercised
indoors during the reference week. Over-representation of males (57%) and single
individuals (31%) are observable in this segment. One in five members of this segment
reported a moderate and/or severe level of generalized anxiety (19%).

5.0. Reflections
One major contribution of the market segmentation analysis carried-out here is the
discovery of new behavioural patterns and the ability to link statistical methods to the
monitoring of outcomes in COVID-19 confinement restrictions. A marketing
segmentation approach can help federal, regional and local decision makers to better
identify universal market segments and tailor segment-suited interventions. Rather than
“one size fits all” results, public health programs and activities can be developed for each
population cluster and provide tools that can change perceptions and develop more
effective responses to tackle positive and negative outcomes of the always changing
COVID-19 confinement environment.
It should be noted that the available public version of the CPSS-Series2 survey,
regrettably, did not contain provincial or territorial breakdowns and was limited to
individual reporting during the “first” phase of the pandemic (May, 2020). CPSS-Series3
findings singled out some of these which included differences in terms of wearing masks
and physical distancing as COVID-19 safety measures are relaxed (Prairies vs. Ontario
and Quebec, rural vs. urban areas). In the "second" and subsequent phases of the
pandemic, shifts in the share of segment composition are likely to occur and so it is
desirable to produce a larger longitudinal picture. More frequent surveys carried out by
Statistics Canada and other data collection agencies are desirable and could yield
important information on common transitions from one cluster to another (e.g. from
Oblivious segment members to others) and the perceptions and behaviours of segment
members surrounding the transition.
In this study, six population segments were clearly identified using a combination of
principal component and k-means cluster statistical analysis of members of the first four
segments (Hygienists, Caregivers, Sound Body Minders, Home-centric, Media-centric and
Oblivious). Overall, members of the first four segments, have developed various coping
styles to deal with the COVID-19 environment restrictions and are, for the most part,
compliers with the present sanitary guidelines imposed by federal, provincial and local
health authorities. However, members of the "Media-centric" and "Oblivious" clusters
are, for different reasons, more likely challenging to reach by health authorities. The
former group is problematic in terms of mental health related issues and the latter by
some degree of negligence in following the imposed sanitary guidelines. These last two
segments are vulnerable to the more negative impacts of confinement such as mental
health deterioration, isolation,food insecurity and human cost (see the work of Zajacova
et. al,2020). It is suggested that appropriate messages need to be tailored to reach these
audiences to promote personal wellbeing and safety.
