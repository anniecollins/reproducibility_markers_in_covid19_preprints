Abstract
Suspension of face-to-face instruction in schools during the COVID-19 pandemic
has led to concerns about consequences for student learning. So far, data to study
this question have been limited. Here we evaluate the effect of school closures on
primary school performance using exceptionally rich data from the Netherlands
(n≈350,000). We use the fact that national exams took place before and after
lockdown, and compare progress during this period to the same period in the three
previous years. The Netherlands underwent only a relatively short lockdown (8
weeks), and features an equitable system of school funding and the world’s highest
rate of broadband access. Still, our results reveal a learning loss of about 3 percentile
points or 0.08 standard deviations. The effect is equivalent to a fifth of a school
year, the same period that schools remained closed. Losses are up to 60% larger
among students from less-educated homes, confirming worries about the uneven toll
of the pandemic on children and families. Investigating mechanisms, we find that
most of the effect reflects the cumulative impact of knowledge learned rather than
transitory influences on the day of testing. Results remain robust when balancing
on the estimated propensity of treatment and using maximum entropy weights, or
with fixed-effects specifications that compare students within the same school and
family. The findings imply that students made little or no progress whilst learning
from home, and suggest losses even larger in countries with weaker infrastructure
or longer school closures.

Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic is transforming society in profound ways, often exacerbating
social and economic inequalities in its wake. In an effort to curb its spread, governments
around the world have moved to suspend face-to-face teaching in schools, affecting some
95% of the world’s student population—the largest disruption to education in history
(1 ). The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child states that governments should
provide primary education for all on the basis of equal opportunity (2 ). To weigh the
costs of school closures against public health benefits (3 –6 ), it is crucial to know whether
students are learning less in lockdown, and whether disadvantaged students do so disproportionately.
Whereas previous research examined the impact of summer recess on learning, or
disruptions from events such as extreme weather or teacher strikes (7 –12 ), COVID-19
presents a unique challenge that makes it unclear how to apply past lessons. Concurrent
effects on the economy make parents less equipped to provide support, as they struggle
with economic uncertainty or demands of working from home (13 , 14 ). The health
and mortality risk of the pandemic incurs further psychological costs, as does the toll of
social isolation (15 , 16 ). Family violence is projected to rise, putting already vulnerable
students at increased risk (17 , 18 ). At the same time, the scope of the pandemic may
compel governments and schools to respond more actively than during other disruptive
events.
Data on learning loss during lockdown have been slow to emerge. Unlike societal
sectors like the economy or the healthcare system, school systems usually do not post data
at high-frequency intervals. Schools and teachers have been struggling to adopt onlinebased solutions for instruction, let alone for assessment and accountability (10 , 19 ).
Early data from online learning platforms suggest a drop in coursework completed (20 )
and an increased dispersion of test scores (21 ). Survey evidence suggests that children
spend considerably less time studying during lockdown, and some (but not all) studies
report differences by home background (22 –26 ). More recently, data have emerged from
students returning to school (27 –29 ). Our study represents one of the first attempts to

quantify learning loss from COVID-19 using externally validated tests, a representative
sample, and techniques that allow for causal inference.

Study setting
In this study, we present evidence on the pandemic’s effect on student progress in the
Netherlands, using a dataset covering 15% of Dutch primary schools throughout the
years 2017–2020 (n≈350,000). The data include biannual test scores in core subjects
for students aged 8 to 11, as well as student demographics and school characteristics.
Hypotheses and analysis protocols for this study were pre-registered (Appendix 4.1).
Our main interest is whether learning stalled during lockdown, and whether students
from less-educated homes were disproportionately affected. In addition, we examine
differences by sex, school grade, subject, and prior performance.
The Dutch school system combines centralized and equitable school funding with a

variety of techniques.
high degree of autonomy in school management (30 , 31 ). The country is close to the
OECD average in school spending and reading performance, but among its top performers
in maths (32 ). No other country has higher rates of broadband penetration (33 , 34 ), and
efforts were made early in the pandemic to ensure access to home learning devices (35 ).
School closures were short in comparative perspective (Appendix 1), and the first wave of
the pandemic had less of an impact than in other European countries (36 , 37 ). For these
reasons, the Netherlands presents a “best-case” scenario, providing a likely lower bound
on learning loss elsewhere in Europe and the world. Despite favorable conditions, survey
evidence from lockdown indicates high levels of dissatisfaction with remote learning (38 ),
and considerable disparities in help with schoolwork and learning resources (39 ).

4

Key to our study design is the fact that national assessments take place twice a year in
the Netherlands (40 ): halfway into the school year in January–February and at the end
of the school year in June. In 2020, these testing dates occurred just before and after the
first nationwide school closures that lasted 8 weeks starting March 16 (Fig. 1). Access to
data from 3 years prior to the pandemic allows us to create a natural benchmark against
which to assess learning loss. We do so using a difference-in-differences design (Appendix
4.2), and address loss to follow-up using various techniques: regression adjustment, rebalancing on propensity scores and maximum entropy weights, and fixed-effects designs
that compare students within the same schools and families.

Results
We assess standardized tests in Maths, Spelling, and Reading for students aged 8–11
(Dutch school grades 4–7), and a composite score of all three subjects. Results are
transformed into percentiles by imposing a uniform distribution separately by subject,
grade, and testing occasion: mid-year vs end-of-year. Fig. 2 shows the difference between
students’ percentile placement in the mid-year and end-of-year test for each of the years
2017–2020. This graph reveals a raw difference ranging from –0.76 percentiles in Spelling
to –2.15 percentiles in Maths. However, this difference does not adjust for confounding
due to trends, testing date, or sample composition. To address these factors, and assess
group differences in learning loss, we go on to estimate a difference-in-differences model
(Appendix 4.2). In our baseline specification, we adjust for a linear trend in year and the
time elapsed between testing dates, and cluster standard errors at the school level.

Baseline specification Fig. 3 shows our baseline estimate of learning loss in 2020
compared to the three previous years, using a composite score of students’ performance
in Maths, Spelling, and Reading. Students lost on average 3.16 percentile points in the
national distribution, equivalent to 0.08 standard deviations (SD) (Appendix 4.3). Losses
are not distributed equally but concentrated among students from less-educated homes.

of the population (Appendix 5.1)—suffered losses 40% larger than the average student
(estimates by parental education: high –3.07, low –4.34, lowest –4.25). In contrast, we find
little evidence that the effect differs by sex, school grade, subject, or prior performance.
In Appendix 7.9, we document considerable variation by school, with some schools seeing
a learning slide of 10 percentile points or more, and others recording no losses or even
small gains.

specification is not prone to false positives, we perform a placebo analysis assigning
treatment status to each of the three comparison years (Appendix 7.2). In each case,
the 95% confidence interval of our main effect spans zero. We also re-estimate our main
specification dropping comparison years one at a time (Appendix 7.3). These results are
estimated with less precision but otherwise in line with those of our main analysis. In
Section 7.13, we report placebo analyses for a wider range of specifications than reported
in our main manuscript, and confirm that our preferred specification fares better than
reasonable alternatives in avoiding spurious results.

Adjusting for loss to follow-up In Fig. 4, we report a series of additional specifications addressing the fact that only a subset of students returning after lockdown sat
the tests. Our difference-in-differences design discards with those students who did not,
which might lead to bias if their performance trajectories differ from those we observe. In
SI Appendix, Table S3, we show that the treatment sample is not skewed on sex, parental
education or prior performance. Therefore, adjusting for these covariates makes little dif-

ference to our results (Appendix 7.1). Next, we balance treatment and control groups on
a wider set of covariates, including at the school-level, using maximum entropy weights
and the estimated propensity of treatment (Appendix 7.4). Moreover, we restrict analysis to schools where at least 75% of students sat their tests after lockdown (Appendix
7.5). Finally, we adjust for time-invariant confounding at the school and family level
using fixed-effects models (Appendix 7.6–7.7). As Fig. 4 shows, social inequalities grow
somewhat when adjusting for selection at the school and family level. The largest gap
in effect sizes between educational backgrounds is found in our within-family analysis,
estimated at 60% (parental education: high –3.25, low –4.67, lowest –5.20). However,
the fixed-effects specification shifts the sample toward larger families, and effects in this
subsample are similar using our baseline specification (Appendix 7.7).

Knowledge learned vs transitory influences Do these results actually reflect a
decrease in knowledge learned, or more transient “day of exam” effects? Social distancing
measures may have altered factors such as seating arrangements or indoor climate, that
in turn can influence student performance (41 –43 ). Following school re-openings, tests
were taken in-person under normal conditions and with minimal social distancing. Still,

8

students may have been under stress or simply unaccustomed to the school setting after
several weeks at home. Similarly, if remote teaching covered the requisite material but put
less emphasis on test-taking skills, results may have declined while knowledge remained
stable. We address this by inspecting performance on generic test of learning readiness
(Appendix 3.1). These tests present the student with a series of words to be read aloud
within a given time. Understanding of the words is not needed, and no curricular content
is covered. The results, in Fig. 5, show that the treatment effects shrink by nearly two
thirds compared to our main outcome (main effect –1.19 vs. –3.16), suggesting that
differences in knowledge learned account for the majority of the drop in performance.
In years prior to the pandemic, we observe no such difference in students’ performance
between the two types of test (Appendix 7.8).

Specification curve analysis To identify the model components that exert the most
influence on the magnitude of estimates we assessed more than 2,000 alternative models
in a specification curve analysis (44 ) (Appendix 7.13). Doing so identifies the control
for pre-treatment trends as the most influential, followed by the control for test timing
and the inclusion of school and family fixed effects. Disregarding the trend and instead
assuming a counterfactual where achievement had stayed flat between 2019 and 2020, the
estimated treatment effect shrinks by 21% to –2.51 percentiles (Appendix 7.11). However,
failure to adjust for pre-treatment trends generates placebo estimates that are biased in
a positive direction and is thus likely to underestimate treatment effects. Excluding
adjustment for testing date decreases the effect size by 12%, while including fixed effects
increases it by 1.6% (school level) or 6.3% (family level). The placebo estimate closest to
zero is found in the version of our preferred specification that includes family fixed effects.
The specification curve also reveals that treatment effects in Maths are more invariant to
assumptions than those in either Reading or Spelling.

Discussion
During the pandemic-induced lockdown in 2020, schools in many countries were forced to
close for extended periods. It is of great policy interest to know whether students are able
to have their educational needs met under these circumstances, and to identify groups
at special risk. In this study, we have addressed this question with uniquely rich data
on primary school students in the Netherlands. There is clear evidence that students are
learning less during lockdown than in a typical year. These losses are evident throughout
the age range we study and across all of the three subject areas: Maths, Spelling, and
Reading. The size of these effects is on the order of 3 percentile points or 0.08 SD,
but students from disadvantaged homes are disproportionately affected. Among lesseducated households, the size of the learning slide is up to 60% larger than in the general
population.
Are these losses large or small? One way to anchor these effects is as a proportion
of gains made in a normal year. Typical estimates of yearly progress for primary school
range between 0.30 and 0.60 SD (45 ). In their projections of learning loss due to the
pandemic, the World Bank assumes a yearly progress of 0.40 SD (46 ). We validate
these benchmarks in our data by exploiting variation in testing dates during comparison
years and show that test scores improve by 0.30–0.40 percentiles per week, equivalent
to 0.31–0.41 SD annually (Appendix 4.3). Using the larger benchmark, a treatment
effect of 3.16 percentiles would translate into 3.16/0.40=7.9 weeks of lost learning—
nearly exactly the same period that schools in the Netherlands remained closed. Using
the smaller benchmark, learning loss exceeds the period of school closures (3.16/0.30=10.5
weeks) implying that students regressed during this time. At the same time, some studies
indicate a progress of up to 0.80 SD annually at the low extreme of our age range (45 ,
47 ), which would indicate that remote learning operated at 50% efficiency.
Another relevant source of comparison is studies of how students progress when school
is out of session for summer (7 –10 ). This literature reports reductions in achievement
ranging from 0.001 to 0.010 SD per school day lost (10 ). Our estimated treatment effect

10

translates into 3.16/35=0.09 percentiles or 0.002 SD per school day1 and is thus on the
lower end of that range. Although early influential studies also found that summer is
a time when socio-economic learning gaps widen, this finding has failed to replicate in
more recent studies (8 , 9 ) or in European samples (48 , 49 ). However, there are limits
to the analogy between summer recess and forced school closures, when children are still
being expected to learn at normal pace (50 ). Our results show that learning loss was
particularly pronounced for students from disadvantaged homes, confirming the fears held
by many that school closures would cause socio-economic gaps to widen (51 –55 ).
We have described The Netherlands as a “best-case” scenario due to the country’s
short school closures, high degree of technological preparedness, and equitable school
funding. However, this does not mean that circumstances were ideal. The short duration
of school closures gave students, educators, and parents little time to adapt. It is possible that remote learning might improve with time (47 ). At the very least, our results
imply that technological access is not itself sufficient to guarantee high-quality remote
instruction. The high degree of school autonomy in the Netherlands is also likely to have
created considerable variation in the pandemic response, possibly explaining the wide
school-level variation in estimated learning loss (Appendix 7.9).
Are these results a temporary setback that schools and teachers can eventually compensate? Only time will tell whether students rebound, remain stable, or fall further
behind. Dynamic models of learning stress how small losses can accumulate into large
disadvantages with time (56 –58 ). Studies of school days lost due to other causes are
mixed—some find durable effects and spillovers to adult earnings (59 , 60 ), while others
report a fadeout of effects over time (61 , 62 ). If learning losses are transient and concentrated in the initial phase of the pandemic, this could explain why results from the US
appear less dramatic than first feared. Early estimates suggest that grade 3–8 students
more than 6 months into the pandemic underperformed by 7.5 percentile points in maths
but saw no loss in reading achievement (28 ).
Nevertheless, the magnitude of our findings appears to validate scenarios projected

by bodies such as the European Commission (38 ) and the World Bank (46 ).2 This is
alarming in light of the much larger losses projected in countries less prepared for the
pandemic. Moreover, our results may underestimate the full costs of school closures
even in the context that we study. Test scores do not consider children’s psycho-social
development (63 , 64 ), neither societal costs due to productivity decline or heightened
pressure among parents (65 , 66 ). Overall, our results highlight the importance of social
investment strategies to “build back better” and enhance resilience and equity in education. Further research is needed to assess the success of such initiatives and address the
long-term fallout of the pandemic for student learning and well-being.

Materials and Methods
Three features of the Dutch education system make this study possible (Appendix 2).
The first is the student monitoring system, which provides our test score data (40 ). This
system comprises a series of mandatory tests that are taken twice a year throughout
a child’s primary school education (age 6–12). The second is the weighted system for
school funding, which until recently obliged schools to collect information on the family
background of all students (31 ). Third is the fact that some schools rely on third-party
service providers to curate data and provide analytical insights. It is not uncommon
that such providers generate anonymized datasets for research purposes. We partnered
with the Mirror Foundation (https://www.mirrorfoundation.org/), an independent research foundation associated with one such service provider, who gave us access to a fully
anonymized dataset of students’ test scores. The sample covers 15% of all primary schools
and is broadly representative of the national student body (Appendix 5.1).

Test scores Nationally standardized tests are taken across three main subjects: Maths,
Spelling, and Reading (Appendix 3.1). Students across the Netherlands take the same

2

The World Bank’s “optimistic” scenario—schools operating at 60% efficiency for 3 months—projects
a 0.06 SD loss in standardized test scores (46 ). The European Commission posits a lower bound learning
loss of 0.008 SD per week (34 ), which multiplied by 8 weeks translates to 0.064 SD. Both these scenarios
are on the same order of magnitude as our findings if marginally smaller.

exam within a given year. These tests are administered in school, and each of them lasts
up to 60 minutes. Test results are transformed to percentile scores, but the norm for
transformation is the same across years so absolute changes in performance over time are
preserved. We rely on translation keys provided by the test producer to assign percentile
scores. However, as these keys are actually based on smaller samples than that at our
disposal, we further impose a uniform distribution in our sample within cells defined by
subject, grade, and testing occasion: mid-year vs end-of-year.
Our main outcome is a composite score that takes the average of all non-missing values
in the three areas (Maths, Spelling, and Reading). In sensitivity analyses in Appendix
7.1, we require a student to have a valid score on all three subjects. We also display
separate results for the three sub-tests in Fig. 3. The test in Maths contains both
abstract problems and contextual problems that describe a concrete task. The test in
Reading assesses the student’s ability to understand written texts, including both factual
and literary content. The test in Spelling asks the student to write down a series of words,
demonstrating that they have mastered the spelling rules. Reliability on these tests is
excellent: composite achievement scores correlate above 0.80 for an individual across two
study years (Appendix 5.3).
As an alternative outcome we also assess students’ performance on shorter assessments
known as “3-minute tests” (drieminutentoets) in Fig. 5 (see Appendix 3.1). This test
consists of a set of cards with words of increasing difficulty to be read aloud during an
allotted time. In the terminology of the test producer, its goal is to assess “technical
reading ability”—likely a mix of reading ability, cognitive processing and verbal fluency.
We interpret it as a test of learning readiness. Crucially, comprehension of the words is
not needed and students and parents are discouraged to prepare for it. As this part of
the assessment does not test for the retention of curricular content, we would expect it
to be less affected by school closures, which is indeed what we find.
Parental education Data on parental education are collected by schools as part of the
national system of weighted student funding, which allocates greater funds per student to
schools that serve disadvantaged populations. The variable codes as high educated those
13

households where at least one parent has a degree above lower secondary education; low
educated those where both parents have a degree above primary education but neither has
one above lower secondary education; and lowest educated those where at least one parent
has no degree above primary education and neither has a degree above lower secondary
education. These groups make up, respectively, 92%, 4%, and 4% of the student body
and our sample (Appendix 5.1). We provide a more extensive discussion of this variable
in Appendix 3.2, 5.3, and 5.4.

Other covariates Sex is a binary variable distinguishing boys and girls. Prior performance is constructed from all test results in the previous year. We create a composite
score similar to our main outcome variable, and split this in to tertiles of top, middle,
and bottom performance. School grade is the year the student belongs in. School starts
at age 4 in the Netherlands but the first three grades are less intensive and more akin
to kindergarten. The last grade of comprehensive school is grade 8, but this grade is
shorter and does not feature much additional didactic material. In matched analyses
using reweighting on the propensity of treatment and maximum entropy weights, we also
include a set of school characteristics described in Appendix 3.2: school-level socioeconomic disadvantage, proportion of non-Western immigrants in the school’s neighborhood,
and school denomination.

Difference-in-differences analysis We analyze the rate of progress in 2020 to that
in previous years using a difference-in-differences design. This first involves taking the
difference in educational achievement pre-lockdown (measured using the mid-year test)
compared to that post-lockdown (measured using the end-of-year test): ∆yi = yi2020−end −
yi2020−mid , where yi is some achievement measure for student i and the superscript 2020
denotes the treatment year. We then calculate the same difference in the three years prior
to the pandemic, ∆yi2017−2019 . These differences can then be compared in a regression
specification:
∆yi = α + Z0i γ + δTi + ij .

14

(1)

where Zi is a vector of control variables, Ti is an indicator for the treatment year 2020,
and ij is an i.i.d. error term clustered at the school level. In our baseline specification,
Zi includes a linear trend for the year of testing and a variable capturing the number of
days between the two tests. To assess heterogeneity in the treatment effect, we add terms
interacting each student characteristic Xi with the treatment indicator Ti :
∆yi = α + Z0i γ + βXi + δ0 Ti + δ1 Ti Xi + ij ,

(2)

where Xi is one of: parental education, student sex, or prior performance. In addition,
we estimate Equation (1) separately by grade and subject. In Appendix 3.2, we provide
more extensive motivation and description of our model and the additional strategies
we use to deal with loss to follow-up. Throughout our analyses, we adjust confidence
intervals for clustering on schools using robust standard errors.
Effect size conversion Our effect sizes are expressed on the scale of percentiles. In educational research it is common to use standard-deviation based metrics such as Cohen’s
d (67 ). Assuming that percentiles were drawn from an underlying normal distribution,
we use the following formula to convert between one and the other:


δ
,
d=Φ
0.50 +
100
−1

(3)

where δ is the treatment effect on the percentile scale, and Φ−1 is the inverse cumulative standard normal distribution. Generally, with “small” or “medium” effect sizes in
the range d ∈ [−0.5, 0.5], this transformation implies a conversion factor of about 0.025
SD per percentile.
Propensity score and entropy weighting Moreover, we match treatment and control groups on a wider range of individual- and school-level characteristics using reweighting on the propensity of treatment (68 ) and maximum entropy balancing (69 ). In both
cases, sex, parental education, prior performance, two- and three-way interactions between them, a student’s school grade, and school-level covariates: school denomination,
15

school disadvantage, and neighborhood ethnic composition. Propensity of treatment
weights involve first estimating the probability of treatment using a binary response
(logit) model and then reweighting observations so that they are balanced on this propensity across comparison and treatment groups. The entropy balancing procedure instead
uses maximum entropy weights that are calibrated to directly balance comparison and
treatment groups non-parametrically on the observed covariates.

School and family fixed effects We perform within-school and within-family analyses
using fixed-effects specifications (70 ). The within-school design discards all variation
between schools by introducing a separate intercept for each school. By doing so, it
eliminates all unobserved heterogeneity across schools which might have biased our results
if, for example, schools where progression within the school year is worse than average are
over-represented during the treatment year. The same logic applies to the within-family
design, which discards all variation between families by introducing a separate intercept
for each group of siblings identified in our data. This step reduces the size of our sample
by approximately 60%, as not every student has a sibling attending a sampled school
within the years that we are able to observe. The benefit is that it allows us to adjust
for all time-invariant confounding at the family level.

Data availability statement The data underlying this study are confidential and
cannot be shared due to ethical and legal constraints. We obtained access through a
partnership with a non-profit who made specific arrangements to allow this research to be
done. For other researchers to access the exact same data, they would have to participate
in a similar partnership. Equivalent data are, however, in the process of being added
to existing datasets widely used for research, such as the Nationaal Cohortonderzoek
Onderwijs (NCO). Analysis scripts underlying all results reported in this article will be
made available in a public repository following publication.

Study context

Education in the Netherlands is based on a common school up to the age of 12, after which
students are placed on separate tracks (71 , 72 ). Schooling is compulsory from age 5 to 16,
but the majority of children start at the age of 4 (71 ). The Dutch system combines a high
degree of school autonomy with a centralized system for school funding and accountability
(30 , 71 , 72 ). The system ultimately dates back to the early 20th century, and arose as
a compromise to give schools equal access to state funding regardless of denomination
(30 , 73 ). To this day, most schools are denominational, predominantly Roman Catholic
or Protestant. Schools are run by local school boards, and the right to establish a school
is enshrined in the constitution, once certain basic criteria are met (71 ). All schools
are funded by the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science (“Ministry of Education”
henceforth), with schools that serve disadvantaged students receiving a larger budget per
capita (31 ). The Dutch system achieves a high degree of both efficiency and equity as
measured by performance on international student assessments (72 ). The Netherlands,
while close to the OECD average in school spending and in Reading performance, places
among Europe’s top performers in Maths (32 ).
During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, the government pursued a so-called
“intelligent lockdown,” relying on voluntary cooperation and allowing ordinary life to
continue as far as possible (37 , 38 , 74 ). School closures were one of few strictly enforced

29

non-pharmaceutical interventions. However, their duration were short compared to most
other OECD countries. As shown in Fig. A1, schools closed on March 16 and reopened
eight weeks later, on May 11. While students initially attended classes every other day, inperson schooling returned to normal activity from June 8. Arguably, the Netherlands was
unusually well prepared for remote learning: the country leads the world in broadband
penetration (33 , 75 ) with more than 90% of households enjoying broadband access even
among the poorest quartile (34 ). Adding to this advantage, the response of national
and local governments was swift: in March 2020, the Ministry of Education devoted 2.5
million euros to online learning devices for students in need (35 ), and this scheme was
extended with another 3.8 million in June (76 ), with similar initiatives at a local level.
Despite these efforts, anecdotal evidence suggests that primary school teachers had
limited prior experience of or preparation for distance learning. In contrast to older
students who can be expected to shoulder some of the responsibility for their study
themselves, primary school study is more dependent on continuous instruction from a
teacher. Being deprived of classroom instruction meant that the responsibility for structuring the school day and creating a supportive work environment largely fell on parents.
Many teachers created instruction packets with physical assignments and handouts that
parents had to collect from schools. There is limited data on how much instruction actually took place online, and how many hours of effective school work students were able
to achieve. However, evidence from Germany suggests that students reduced their study
time by as much as half (19 ). Survey evidence from the Netherlands also indicates that
there were considerable disparities in help with schoolwork and learning resources (39 ),
and high levels of dissatisfaction with remote learning (38 ). This evidence mirrors that
from several other countries, showing important disparities in children’s conditions for
learning from home (22 , 23 , 53 , 77 ).

Data sources

Three features of the Dutch education system make this study possible. The first is
the student monitoring system, LVS, which provides our test score data. This system
comprises a series of mandatory tests that are taken twice a year throughout a child’s
primary school education (age 6–12). The second feature is the weighted system for
school funding, which until recently obliged schools to collect information on the family
background of all students. Third is the fact that some schools rely on third-party
service providers to curate data and provide analytical insights. It is not uncommon
that such providers generate anonymized datasets for research purposes. We teamed
up with the Mirror Foundation (https://www.mirrorfoundation.org/), an independent
research foundation associated with one such service provider, who gave us access to a
fully anonymized dataset of students’ test scores. In the following we describe the student
monitoring system, the student background data, and our data partner.

2.1

Student monitoring system (LVS)

The measures of student performance that we use are gathered from the student monitoring system or leerlingvolgsysteem (LVS), which is a distinguishing feature of Dutch
primary education (40 ). The LVS is one of several components introduced to uphold
quality and accountability despite the country’s high degree of school autonomy (72 ).
Diagnostic tests are administered to all students twice a year, normally in the middle
of the school year in January/February and at the end of the school year in June. By
continuously assessing students and tracking their performance longitudinally, the system
helps educators tailor their instruction to the needs of a particular cohort and identify
students in demand of extra support. The LVS was first developed by the National Institute for Educational Measurement, CITO, in the 1990s. CITO was originally founded as
a non-profit organization in the 1960s, but is today a commercial enterprise with several
international branches. In the Netherlands, CITO testing services are developed and sold
on a “semicommercial” basis (40 ), which means that the Ministry of Education serves as

31

the main funder of CITO and appoints its board director. Schools decide on whether to
purchase their service using education funds that are public. Since 2014, it is mandatory
for all primary schools to use an LVS, with CITO being the leading provider holding a
large majority of the market share.

2.2

Student background data

Data on student background are collected by schools as part of the national system of
weighted student funding or gewichtenregeling. Primary education in the Netherlands is
operated as a voucher system, where funding is provided to schools by the Ministry of
Education on a per-student basis (31 , 72 ). Since 1985, an additional contribution toward
each student depends on their social background in an effort to reduce social inequality
and raise bottom performance. The amount of funding that a school gets is proportional
to the socioeconomic composition of the student body, with schools with a higher proportion of disadvantaged students receiving more funds per student. To support this system,
schools are legally required to collect data on parental background when a student first
starts school or transfers between schools. The number of indicators used to determine
school funding has changed throughout the history of the system, but between 2006 and
2019, parental education was the sole indicator (78 , 79 ). In 2019, responsibility for determining funding weights was transferred to the central government, using a wider set of
indicators and administrative data stored by Statistics Netherlands. As this information
is only available at a school level, our main analysis uses the individual-level data on
parental education collected by schools. We use the newer indicator of student disadvantage derived from administrative data in propensity-score weighted and entropy-balanced
analyses in Section 7.4, as well as in school-level analyses in Section 7.9.

2.3

Data partner (Mirror Foundation)

To access test scores and student background data, we entered a partnership with the
Mirror Foundation (https://www.mirrorfoundation.org/), an independent non-profit
research foundation set up to support educational research initiatives. The Mirror Foun32

dation enabled us to access a fully anonymized dataset of 15% of primary schools in the
Netherlands. The schools are users of a data analytics platform that provides school
boards with timely insights based on LVS and other data that are kept by the schools.
All schools in the Netherlands are mandated to use a digital interface for student monitoring, and some also subscribe to services offering more extensive functionality and
independent analysis—as is the case for the schools in our sample. The dataset was
generated by anonymizing existing school records from the schools’ LVS and done at the
schools’ instruction, whereby the latter act as ‘data controller’ in the definition of the
EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Anonymization was done with the
explicit and stated objective of supporting academic research. All analysis was carried
out in accordance with the GDPR and at no point did the authors have access to data
that would allow the identification of individuals. The study received ethical approval
from the Central University Research Ethics Committee at the University of Oxford.

Variables
Outcomes
Curricular tests

Achievement is measured via the LVS system using performance on standardized tests
developed by CITO. Tests are taken across three main subject areas: Maths, Spelling, and
Reading, the first two of which are mandatory. Each test lasts up to one hour per subject.
Maths comprises abstract problems involving the four arithmetic operations—addition,
subtraction, multiplication, division—as well as applied problems based on concrete tasks.
The applied tasks evaluate the student’s facility with concepts such as time or currency.
In Spelling, a series of words is presented verbally and the student demonstrates that
he or she has mastered the spelling rules by writing the words down correctly. Reading
assesses the student’s ability to understand written texts, including both factual and
literary content. The student is presented with a series of texts and at the end of each,
he or she gets to answer a set of multiple-choice questions. All tests are psychometrically
33

validated by CITO and translated to national performance benchmarks expressed as
percentile scores for a given grade and test (80 –82 ). However, as the translation keys
provided by the test producer are actually based on smaller samples than that at our
disposal, we further re-norm the distribution within our sample. That is, we pool results
across all study years and impose a uniform distribution separately by subject, grade,
and testing occasion: mid-year vs end-of-year. Our main outcome is a composite score
that takes the average of non-missing percentile scores across the three subject areas. We
also display performance on each separate test and, in supplementary analyses in Section
7.1, require a student to have valid scores in all three subjects. The reliability of these
tests is excellent, as we discuss in Section 5.3 below.

3.1.2

Learning readiness

As an alternative outcome we also assess students’ performance on a test of learning
readiness known as the drieminutentoets (“3-minute test”) (83 ). This test consists of
three cards of which the first two presents 150 monosyllabic words of increasing difficulty,
and the third presents 120 words with 2–4 syllables each. The task is to read as many
words as possible out loud during an allotted time of one minute per card. A score is
calculated by counting the number of successfully read words. These tests are likely to
require a range of skills including reading ability, cognitive processing and verbal fluency.
Crucially, however, they do not require any comprehension of the words involved and their
aim is not to test the retention of curricular content. Unlike the other diagnostic tests,
they do not count towards a child’s wider school assessment and it is common to advise
parents and children against preparing for them. For example, Ouders van Nu (Parents
Today), a popular magazine and online information portal, writes: “You do not have to
prepare your child for the 3-minute test. It is better not to pay too much attention to
it, because it can cause your child to fear failure. Moreover, the test can give a distorted
picture if your child has practiced at home” (84 ). While the content is divorced from
the taught curriculum, these tests are taken in conjunction with the regular assessments
and under similar circumstances. Therefore, if observed learning loss was mainly due

34

to “day of exam” influences such as increased stress, distractions, or unfamiliar testing
environments, we would expect similar setbacks in the pandemic year as on other tests.
We standardize test scores in the same way as for the other tests, by imposing a uniform
distribution within school grade and testing occasion, pooled across all years.

3.2
3.2.1

Covariates
School grade

Schooling in the Netherlands is mandatory from age 5, but the first three grades feature
limited didactic material and are comparable to kindergarten (72 ). We therefore follow
students from grade 4 and until the penultimate grade of primary schooling, grade 7. The
final grade 8 is dedicated to transitioning to secondary education and is shorter than the
other grades. Also, the standard end-of-year test is in fact the school leaver’s test, which
was suspended in 2020. The designation of grades differs from international standards,
where the ages we study would correspond to grades 1–4 of elementary school. To avoid
confusion with international standards we choose to label grades by the modal age of
students in each grade. Given that tests are taken in the latter half of the school year,
these are ages 8, 9, 10, and 11.

3.2.2

Parental education

Information on parental education is collected from parents by schools as part of the
weighted student funding system (31 ). The classification is therefore the one designated
by the Ministry of Education to determine school funding weights. The variable takes on
three values: high if at least one parent has a degree above lower secondary education;
low if both parents have a degree above primary education but neither has one above
lower secondary; and lowest if at least one parent has no degree above primary education
and neither has a degree above lower secondary. The three groups make up, respectively,
92%, 4%, and 4% of the student body and our sample (Fig. A2). The school funding
weights based on surveys of parental education were replaced by a new system based on
administrative data in 2019 (Section 2.2). Nevertheless, the earlier information collected
35

by schools remains available and we rely on it in our main analysis for two reasons. First,
the new funding weights are only made available at a school level and therefore do not
allow us to distinguish the socioeconomic background of individual students. Secondly,
survey data on education are likely to be superior in some respects, especially for immigrant parents whose credentials often do not register in official statistics. We provide
further discussion on the strengths and weaknesses of this variable in Section 5.3 and 5.4
below.

3.2.3

Prior performance

To assess prior performance, we take all available tests from the previous year and calculate a percentile score similarly to our main outcome measures. We then create a
categorical variable by calculating a student’s average rank across all non-missing values
and splitting the variable into three equal-sized groups. By basing this information on
data collected in the previous year, we avoid the mechanical correlation that would obtain
if prior performance had been measured at baseline in the same year as we assess student
progress. Doing so is known to introduce regression to the mean which can lead to various
statistical artifacts (85 ). In Section 5.3 and 6, we show that prior performance is the
strongest predictor of current performance. In Section 5.3, we show that our strategy
of measuring prior performance in the previous year successfully breaks the mechanical
correlation with subsequent achievement trajectories.

3.2.4

Immigrant background

In the Netherlands today, immigrant minorities make up a significant share of the student body (72 ). Unfortunately we lack an individual-level indicator of immigrant background. Instead, we measure the proportion of non-Western inhabitants in a school’s
neighborhood using administrative data. A person is defined as having a non-Western
background if they or at least one of their parents were born in Turkey or countries in
Africa, Latin America and Asia, except former Dutch colonies and Japan. Although
this measure reflects the composition of the neighborhood rather than the student body,

36

the two are likely to be correlated given that residential proximity is one of the most
important determinants of school choice in the Netherlands (86 , 87 ). We use this measure in propensity-score weighted and entropy-balanced analyses in Section 7.4, as well
as in school-level analyses in Section 7.9. The absence of an individual-level measure of
immigrant background raises the possibility that differential effects of the pandemic by
parental education may be driven by immigrant minorities. We discuss this issue and
why we do not believe it is a grave concern in Section 5.4 below.

3.2.5

School disadvantage

In recent years, there has been increasing debate about the reliance on parental education
as the sole indicator of socioeconomic disadvantage and determinant of school funding
weights in the Dutch system (78 , 79 ). Following a prolonged investigation, the practice
was therefore replaced in 2019 by one where the Ministry of Education determines school
funding with the help of administrative data held by Statistics Netherlands (88 ). The
factors considered in the new measure include the educational level of both the mother
and the father as before; but also the country of origin of the parents, the duration of
the mother’s residence in the Netherlands, and whether parents have taken part in debt
restructuring (schuldsanering) (89 ). We prefer the earlier parental education measure as
it is available at an individual level. However, we use the new school funding weights
in propensity-score weighted and entropy-balanced analyses in Section 7.4, as well as in
school-level analyses in Section 7.9.

3.2.6

School denomination

A main policy justification for the high degree of decentralization in Dutch education is
the notion that parents should have the right to choose a school for their children that
corresponds to their values (30 , 71 , 73 ). Consequently, the majority of schools are run by
private school boards, and a large proportion of them are faith-based (mostly Christian).
We therefore include school denomination as an additional adjustment variable in our
matched analyses. Here we distinguish between three categories: public schools, Christian

37

schools, and other schools. Christian schools include schools of Protestant, Catholic,
and Reformist denomination. The “other” category includes faith-based schools of nonChristian denomination (e.g., Jewish, Muslim, Hindu), but is predominantly made up of
schools based on a particular pedagogy, such as Freinet, Montessori, Pestalozzi, Reggio
Emilia, or Waldorf education.

3.2.7

Sex and sibling identification

This information is collected by the schools in conjunction with parental education and
is available from school records.

Analytical strategy

4.1

Pre-analysis plan

We pre-registered our hypotheses and study design at the Open Science Framework (90 ).
In our pre-analysis plan we described the sample inclusion criteria, key variables, and
hypotheses to be tested. In particular, the pre-analysis plan outlines the student monitoring system, the difference-in-differences setup, the school grades that we choose to
include, the operationalization of parental education and past performance, and possible
strategies to deal with attrition. Moreover, we proposed 5 hypotheses based on a reading
of previous literature on learning loss due to temporary school closures or during summer
recess:
H1: Students are learning less during lockdown than in a typical year.
H2: Learning loss is greater among students from less-educated homes.
H3: Learning loss is greater among low-performing students.
H4: Learning loss is greater among boys than girls.
H5: Learning loss is greater in Maths than in Reading or Spelling.

38

Among the pre-registered hypotheses, H1 and H2 receive support. Contrary to H3
and H4, we found no marked variation by prior performance or gender. H5 was not
borne out either, but in supplementary analyses in Section 7.13 it emerges that results
for Maths do appear to be somewhat more robust to specification than other subjects.
In our pre-analysis plan we also committed to making any deviations from protocol
explicit in our final publication, and we do so here. Deviations are mainly due to one
of two reasons: either the data contained information that made it possible to expand
our analysis (e.g., with school and family fixed effects), or we added components to our
model to ensure that identifying assumptions were satisifed (e.g., terms for year trend
and date tested). In addition to the steps outlined in our pre-analysis plan, we extended
our study design as follows:
• We had originally proposed to analyze test scores in the three subjects Maths,
Spelling, and Reading. As results across these subjects were similar, we decided to
summarize them using a composite score in our main analysis (Section 3.1), which
was not part of the pre-analysis plan. We still display additional results for the
separate subjects as originally intended.
• We had originally envisioned analyzing test scores on an absolute scale such that
learning progress and not just changes in relative rank could be quantified. After
consultation with the test producer (CITO), it became apparent that raw scores
on the various tests were not possible to compare on the same scale. We therefore
created the rank transformed variables that form our outcome (Section 3.1).
• To test the validity of our identification strategy, we ran placebo tests where we
estimated our treatment effect across all years prior to 2020 (Section 7.2), as well
as robustness analyses omitting single counterfactual years (Section 7.3). It then
became apparent that we needed to adjust for the secular time trend and the number of days between tests to satisfy the parallel trends assumption underlying our
difference-in-differences analysis.
• To adjust for attrition in the treatment year, we adopted a larger number of strate39

gies than we had originally envisioned in our pre-registration. In particular, in
matched analyses we were able to include a larger number of covariates than originally described (Section 7.4). Moreover, school and family fixed effects (Section
7.6–7.7) were not part of our original pre-analysis plan but emerged as the possibility became apparent after having accessed the data, as did the idea of analyzing
schools with near-complete retention (Section 7.5).
• The “3-minute tests” of learning readiness were not part of our pre-analysis plan
(Section 3.1 and 7.8). We were aware of these tests at the time of pre-registration
but excluded them from our plan precisely because learning loss would be less likely
to manifest here. In early presentations of our work, however, the question of “day
of exam” effects came up and it occurred to us that these tests could be used to
analyze this issue.

4.2

Identification strategy

Estimating the effect of school closures on student achievement raises several challenges.
A naive approach would be to compare average national test scores following school
closures to average national test scores in a previous year. However, this ignores the considerable fluctuation in performance that can occur due to changes in student composition
or other factors from one year to the next. It is therefore vital that achievement measures
are collected both before schools closed and after they reopened, so that progress in this
period can be compared to progress during the same period in previous years. Still, if
not all students return to school following reopenings, differences in the composition of
test takers from the mid-year to the end-of-year test may bias estimates. In our analysis,
we only include students who take both the mid-year test, before schools closed, and
the end-of-year test, after schools reopened. This is, in effect, a differences-in-differences
design (91 ):
∆yi = α + δTi + ij ,

(4)

where ∆yi = yiend − yimid is an individual student’s relative movement in the achieve-

40

ment ranking from the mid-year to the end-of-year test, Ti is an indicator for the treatment
year 2020, and ij is an i.i.d. error term clustered at the school level. The coefficient δ
thus captures overall learning loss due to the pandemic.
This specification deals with the fact that the composition of test takers may differ
between the mid-year and end-of-year test by ensuring that only students present at
both occasions contribute to the estimation. However, it does not deal with factors other
than the pandemic that may influence achievement growth from one year to the next,
neither with the fact that the composition of test-takers in the treatment year may differ
from that in comparison years. To adjust for global factors differing between years, we
therefore include a further vector of control variables Zi :
∆yi = α + Z0i γ + δTi + ij .

(5)

In our baseline specification, Zi includes a linear trend for the year of testing and
a variable capturing the number of days between the two tests. Both these factors are
important. Prior to the pandemic, the rate of progress between the two tests increased
incrementally (Fig. A3) and it is arguable that the same trend would have continued
unabated in absence of the pandemic. Moreover, end-of-year tests occurred on average
later in the year during 2020 compared to previous years. Since it is well documented
that test scores tend to improve with instruction time (92 , 93 ), a credible counterfactual
would have to take this difference in timing into account. In supplementary analyses, we
show how the results differ if we do not account for time trends or testing date.
To deal with differences in the composition of students between treatment and comparison years, we pursue several strategies. The first is simply to include a set of student
characteristics Xi . We first use this setup including one variable at a time to assess
heterogeneity in the treatment effect, interacting each student characteristic Xi with the
treatment indicator Ti :
∆yi = α + Z0i γ + βXi + δ0 Ti + δ1 Ti Xi + ij ,

41

(6)

where Xi is one of: parental education, student sex, or prior performance. We also
estimate separate models for each school grade. In the next step, we add all student
covariates jointly as control variables:

∆yi = α + Z0i γ + X0i β + δTi + ij ,

(7)

where Xi is a vector containing parental education, student sex, and prior performance. Our dataset includes not only student covariates but also school characteristics,
and potential interactions between variables. A flexible way to adjust for high-dimensional
variation is through weighting schemes that ensure that characteristics are balanced between comparison and treatment group. Rosenbaum and Rubin (94 ) show how a large
set of potential confounders can be reduced to a single propensity score, capturing the
conditional probability of treatment. This approach proceeds in two steps: first by estimating the probability of treatment conditional on all observed covariates, and second
by estimating the main outcome equation while balancing on the propensity score. The
propensity score p̂(Xi ) is estimated from a logistic regression of the treatment indicator
on the set of covariates. It is possible to incorporate it in several ways but we use it to
construct a set of regression weights (68 ):
P
E[∆y(0)d
| T = 1] =

{i|T =0}
P

∆yi vi

{i|T =0}

vi

,

(8)

where the weight vi of each observation is related to the propensity score through
the equation vi =

p̂(Xi )
.
1−p̂(Xi )

While this approach ensures that covariates are balanced

asymptotically, this may not always hold in practice. An alternative approach is therefore
proposed by Hainmueller (69 ), that uses maximum entropy weights to balance comparison
and treatment groups directly on the observed covariates. Building on the above example,
this approach estimates the counterfactual in absence of treatment as follows:
P
E[∆y(0)d
| T = 1] =

{i|T =0}
P

∆yi wi

{i|T =0}

42

wi

,

(9)

where wi is a weight chosen to minimize the entropy distance metric, log (wi /qi ):

min H(w) =
wi

X

wi log (wi /qi ) ,

(10)

{i|T =0}

with qi = 1/n0 denoting a base weight, and implemented subject to a set of R balancing constraints:
X

wi cri (Xi ) = mr ,

r ∈ 1, . . . , R.

(11)

{i|T =0}

A further set of normalizing constraints ensure that weights wi are non-negative for all
P
i where T = 0, and that they sum to unity: {i|T =0} wi = 1. In both the propensity score
and maximum entropy balanced analyses, we adjust for a large set of covariates including
interaction terms between all individual variables as well as school disadvantage, ethnic
composition, and school denomination (Section 7.4). Across these models, we adjust for
compositional differences using balancing weights while including the vector Zi for testing
year and date as standard regression controls.
All these three approaches—regression adjustment, propensity score weighting, and
maximum entropy balancing—represent different ways of achieving balance on observed
covariates but are vulnerable to unobserved sources of heterogeneity. In additional analyses, we make use of the fact that students are nested within schools and families to
estimate fixed-effects designs (70 ). This allows us to adjust for any time-invariant confounding at the school or family level, whether due to observed or unobserved sources of
heterogeneity. The fixed-effects design can be written:

∆yi =

J
X

αj Jij + Z0i γ + X0i β + δTi + ij ,

(12)

j=1

where Jij = 1Ji =j is a binary indicator equal to one if unit i belongs to cluster j,
and zero otherwise. We implement two versions of this model: one where the Jij group
identifiers are school level indicators grouping all students within the same school, and
one where they are family indicators taking the same value for siblings. Finally, we
estimate a version of the school-level model where we allow the estimated learning loss

43

to vary by school, by introducing a school-specific intercept αj and treatment coefficient
δj (95 ):
∆yi = αj + Z0i γ + X0i β + δj Ti + ij ,
αj ∼ N (µ0 , σ02 ),

δj ∼ N (µ1 , σ12 )

(13)
(14)

This model is useful because it lets us explore how schools differ in the impact suffered
from the pandemic, and how this depends on school-level characteristics such as school
disadvantage and ethnic composition (Section 7.9). We estimate all models in the R
statistical computing environment using packages listed in Section 4.4 below.

4.3.1

Effect size conversions
Percentiles and standardized effects

Our effect sizes are expressed on the scale of percentiles. In educational research it is
common to use standard-deviation based metrics such as Cohen’s d (96 ):

d=

x̄1 − x̄2
,
σp

(15)

where x̄1 − x̄2 is the difference in means between treatment and comparison groups
and σp is the pooled standard deviation. To convert between treatment effects on the percentile scale and standardized effects, we rely on the lesser known U3 metric also proposed
by Cohen (67 ), which describes the overlap between two distributions. Specifically, U3
is defined as the proportion of the comparison group exceeded by the upper half of cases
in the treatment group. Conversion between U3 and d can be done with the following
equation:
d = Φ−1 (U3 ),

(16)

where Φ−1 is the inverse cumulative standard normal distribution. While this conversion applies to the normal case, U3 is defined such that it is invariant to any rankpreserving transformation. Hence, we can apply the same conversion to our percentile
scores under the assumption that they came from an underlying normal distribution.
44

For two identical distributions with no difference in means, the upper half of cases
in the treatment group will exceed exactly half of the cases in the comparison group.
In this case, U3 = 0.50 and d = Φ−1 (0.50) = 0. A difference of −3 percentiles in the
treatment group vs the comparison group implies that U3 = 0.50 − 0.03 = 0.47. Hence,
the standardized effect size equivalent becomes d = Φ−1 (0.47) = −0.075. More generally,
with “small” or “medium” effect sizes in the range d ∈ [−0.5, 0.5], Cohen’s U3 implies a
conversion factor of 0.025 standard deviations per percentile.
4.3.2

Benchmarks for annual progress

Another way to quantify treatment effects is as a proportion of gains made in a normal
year. In doing so, it is common to rely on age-specific benchmarks derived from standardized tests. For example, the World Bank’s simulations of COVID-19 induced learning loss
assume a progress rate of 0.40 SD per year based on students in the Programme for International Student Assessment (46 ). In the US, Bloom, Hill, and coauthors (97 ) report
annual gains for our age range of 8–11 years based on nationally normed tests in Maths
and Reading. Their reported annual gains range from 0.60 SD at age 8 to 0.32 SD at
age 11 (average 0.42 SD) in Reading and from 0.89 SD at age 8 to 0.41 SD at age 11
(average 0.60 SD) in Maths.
To derive appropriate benchmarks for our population, we estimate weekly test score
gains in our data using tests taken in the comparison years 2017–2019. Specifically, we
estimate the following regression equation:

∆yi =

K
X

αk Ki + λWi + ij ,

(17)

k=1

where ∆yi is the difference score defined earlier, Ki is a set of indicators for the three
years 2017, 2018, 2019, and Wi is a term capturing the number of weeks (i.e.,

days
)
7

elapsed between the mid-year and end-of-year test. In Table A1 we provide estimates of
the parameter λ, capturing weekly learning progress in percentile scores, for the whole
sample and for different subgroups. In contrast to US studies, progress in our data does
not appear to be very dependent on age but is mostly in the range of 0.3–0.4 percentiles
45

per week. Gains in Reading are smaller, likely due to the non-mandatory character of
these tests (Section 3.1 and 5.2). Anecdotally, when testing is not mandatory, schools
may choose to give preference to weaker students in administering tests which could
bias the estimates. We therefore focus on progress in Maths and Spelling which is more
representative of the population.
A progress of 0.3–0.4 percentiles per week implies an annual gain of 12–16 percentiles
when multiplied by the 40 weeks of a school year. Alternatively, assuming (generously)
that children learn at the same rate throughout the 52 weeks in the year, the rate becomes
16–21 percentiles per year. Applying the inverse cumulative standard normal transformation described in Eq. [16] gives us the following benchmarks for annual gains of 12,
16, and 21 percentiles: 0.31 SD, 0.41 SD, 0.55 SD. For our preferred treatment effect
estimate of 0.075 SD and the middle estimate of 0.41 SD annual progress, this translates
into 0.075/0.41 = 18.29% of a school year. Alternatively, we may take the estimated
treatment effect on the original percentile scale (3 percentiles) and divide it by an annual
estimated gain of 16 percentiles to get 3/16=18.75% of a school year. A different way to
arrive at the same conclusion is to take the estimated treatment effect of 3 percentiles
and divide it directly by the weekly estimated gain of 0.4 percentiles which gives us an
effect equivalent to 3/0.4=7.5 weeks, or 18.75% of a 40-week school year.

4.4

Statistical software

Analyses were done in R (version 4.0.3). We used the estimatr package to cluster standard errors at the school level, as well as to include school and family fixed effects. We
used the lme4 package for the multilevel analyses. To adjust our sample using matching and weighting techniques, we relied on the WeightIt and cobalt packages. We are
thankful to the R community, in particular to the tidyverse, broom, and lubridate
data wrangling libraries, and the data.table library that helped us greatly speed up
data processing. All computations were done on a machine running Mac OSX 10.17.7.
Analysis scripts underlying all results reported in this article will be made available in a
public repository following publication.

Quality control
Representativeness

We obtained access to the data through the Mirror Foundation, and an educational
analytics provider with which the foundation collaborates (Section 2.3). Selection into
the sample is thus mediated through a school’s use of the educational analytics service.
There might be concerns whether this selection is non-random, and hence how well our
sample represents the universe of schools in the Netherlands. In Fig. A2 we evaluate this
question by inspecting the distribution of observable characteristics in our sample and the
population. The sample distribution mirrors the population on most observables: school
size, denomination, urbanity, parental education, and school disadvantage, with a few
exceptions. There is some over-representation of mid-sized schools (101–200 students)
and sampled schools are located in slightly more ethnically diverse neighborhoods on
average. Importantly, the relative representation of school type (e.g. public or Christian)
is near identical to that in the population, as is the distribution of parental education
within schools. Schools in our sample are also close to the population distribution on the
newer composite indicator of school disadvantage (Section 2.2 and 3.2).
47

This leaves the possibility that our sample is selected on unobserved characteristics.
In particular, it is possible that adopters of the analytics service are especially invested in
digital infrastructure and data-based accountability. Although all schools are mandated
to use a digital interface for student monitoring, many existing solutions are simple data
management tools with limited analytical functionality. To the extent that the schools
in our sample are more invested in digital infrastructure, they may have been better
equipped to cope with online learning which could lead us to underestimate the impact
of pandemic school closures. Another consideration is ability to pay, given that the
platform service is offered on a paid subscription basis. However, the cost of the service
is minor relative to a school budget: 1,500 euro annually, which corresponds to 3% of
a single teacher’s salary (50,000 euro) or less than 0.1% of a typical school budget (2
million euro). As the main determinant of school funding until 2019 was the parental
education of the student body, the fact that this does not differ markedly between the
sample and the population (Fig. A2) corroborates that economic considerations are not
a major determinant of service uptake.

5.2

Missing data

We define our analytical sample as all observations in the relevant grades in our database
for which there is valid information on sex. Table A2, top panel, shows missing data
on covariates by year and grade: sex, parental education, prior performance, school ID,
school denomination, school disadvantage, neighborhood ethnic composition, and family
ID. There is no missing data on parental education, which is information that schools
have to collect by law. About 6% lack performance data from the previous year. This
proportion is similar across all grades and years, albeit slightly large in earlier grades.
All students are nested within a school, and 96% could be linked to contextual school
variables (all but 48 schools). There is a high proportion of missing data on the family
identifier that we use for fixed-effects models (42%). This reflects the fact that data are
missing for all students who do not have a sibling in the same school. Our sample in
family fixed-effects models becomes even smaller, as it is not enough that a student has
48

a sibling in the school but there also needs to be within-family variation in treatment
status.
Table A2, bottom panel, shows missing data on test scores by grade and year. Test
score data are missing for a significant share of the sample, with missing values being
higher in Reading than in either Maths or Spelling. This is due to the regulation of the
student monitoring system, which only requires schools to report student achievement
in Maths and Spelling (Section 3.1). Consequently, some schools are choosing to test
students in Reading only at the mid-year test (most common in the youngest grade) or
only at the end-of-year test (more common in the later grades). In the treatment year
2020, there is also a significant amount of missing data on the end-of-year test following
students’ return from school closures. This missingness will bias our estimates if it is
selected on the outcome variable, that is, if only those students who tend to over- or
underperform relative to the middle-of-year test are returning to school. Reassuringly,
Table A3 shows that the missing data is almost perfectly balanced by prior performance:
the composition of top, middle, and bottom performers is similar in comparison and
treatment years.

5.3
5.3.1

Measurement error
Parental education

Most of the right-hand side variables in our analysis—year, grade, testing date, sex—are
likely to be measured with little error, but parental education is potentially of concern.
(We discuss prior performance together with outcome variables in the next section.)
Discussions of measurement error typically start from the “classical” assumptions that
error is simply a white-noise term uncorrelated with the true values of the variable of
interest and with the regression residual (98 , 99 ). Such error leads to bias toward the
null when it occurs in a predictor variable. For categorical variables, error is necessarily
mean-reverting, that is, negatively correlated with true values. In this case, the classical
assumptions cannot hold and are usually replaced by the assumption that any error is
non-differential, meaning that misclassification does not depend on the regression out49

come. The consequences here are similar, in that any misclassification will bias regression
estimates toward the null (100 , 101 ).
Parental education is likely to have relatively high reliability in our data considering
that it is reported by parents themselves, rather than by students which is known to cause
problems (99 , 102 , 103 ). Data collected by questionnaire is also superior to administrative register data in some respects, in particular, in that incorrectly matched records and
underreporting of foreign credentials can be avoided (104 –106 ). However, the definition
of the categories means that we are only able to separate out the very bottom of the
educational distribution, and we are thereby likely to miss important sources of variation
in parental education in Dutch society. Here we are constrained by the official definition
of school funding weights (Section 2.2 and 3.2), which unfortunately prevents us from
coding our data differently. Nevertheless, the uneven size of the categories should be
mentioned as a limitation.

5.3.2

Test scores

The tests we use have been developed by the Dutch National Institute for Educational
Measurement, CITO (Section 2 and 3.1), and have gone through extensive psychometric
validation. The reliability of these tests is in most cases around 0.90 (80 –82 ). Indeed, in
Table A4, we use our data to show that the correlation of the composite achievement score
with tests taken over the previous year exceed 0.80 in both treatment and comparison
years. The scope for measurement error in test scores to influence our analysis is therefore
limited. Nevertheless, it merits discussion what influence any remaining error might have
on our estimates. As test scores enter both into our outcome measures and in analyzing
potential heterogeneity by prior performance, we discuss each of these in turn.
In contrast to predictor variables, classical measurement error is of limited consequence when it occurs in outcome variables—except that it increases sampling variance.
Measurement error in an outcome might still bias estimates if it is mean-reverting, that
is, the error term is negatively correlated with true values (98 ). In this case, the consequences are similar to classical measurement error in a predictor: estimates are biased

50

toward the null. As with categorical variables, mean-reverting error often occurs in
bounded variables due to floor and ceiling effects. A percentile score is bounded, so in
principle, any error here will be mean-reverting. The outcome of our analysis, however,
is the difference between two percentiles. Unlike the underlying scores, this variable
is approximately normally distributed and well within the range of theoretical bounds
[−99, 99] (main manuscript, Fig. 2). We therefore believe that the classical assumptions
are a valid approximation, and error in our outcomes is unlikely to substantially bias
estimates.
The use of test scores on the right-hand side of a regression raises particular issues due
to the correlation of test scores over time. In particular, regression to the mean entails
that students in the bottom will always tend to improve while those in the top will
deteriorate, on average. If achievement is measured with error, it is hard to distinguish
actual improvement or deterioration from such artifacts (85 ). To reduce the risk of errors,
we use all of a student’s test scores in the last year when measuring prior performance
(Section 3.2). In Table A4 we show that prior performance is a reliable predictor of current
performance: correlations with subsequent performance on the mid-year and end-of-year
test exceed 0.80 in both comparison and treatment years. At the same time, by using
data from the prior year we avoid a mechanical correlation with subsequent change in
performance: the correlation between prior performance and the change score that is our
outcome is less than 0.05 in absolute size in both comparison and treatment years. We
therefore believe there is limited risk that regression to the mean might bias our results.

5.4

Confounding

A main concern in our data is that we are not able to observe immigrant background of
individual students. This raises the question of to what extent ethnic minority status is
proxied for by our measure of parental education (Section 2.2 and 3.2). Given that the
categorization distinguishes only among the very lowest levels of education, an important
question is whether a large proportion of those classified as less educated in our sample are
non-Western immigrants. One potential reason for such overrepresentation is if foreign
51

credentials are not observed. This is a common problem in administrative register data,
but is less likely in our data which was collected by parental questionnaires. However,
non-Western immigrants are still likely to be overrepresented in the bottom groups if
only because most non-Western countries have lower average levels of schooling than the
Netherlands.
To assess the overlap, in Table A5 we present aggregate population data on the joint
distribution of parental education and immigrant background among school children in
2018–2019 from Statistics Netherlands. These data confirm that immigrant parents are
overrepresented in the “lowest educated” category (88% vs 27% in the total population)
but much less so in the “low educated” category (35% vs 27% in the total population).
Thus, an absence of large differences in treatment effect between the “low” and “lowest”
educated groups indicates that the greater vulnerability of children from less-educated
homes is not primarily driven by immigrant background. Note that these figures are
based on population registers, which may exaggerate the overlap between low education
and immigrant origin relative to survey data for the reasons discussed above.

6

Descriptive statistics

Table A3 shows summary statistics for the full sample broken up by comparison and
treatment groups. Because of the large sample size, most differences are statistically
significant even when they are quantitatively unimportant. For example, the proportion
non-Western immigrants in the school’s neighborhood is 0.17 in both comparison and
treatment groups but nevertheless different (at the third decimal point) at a level that
passes the 0.1% significance threshold. Substantive differences between comparison and
treatment groups are thus minor, with two exceptions: students in the highest grade (age
11) are underrepresented in the comparison group but not in the treatment group. Table
A3 shows that students in this grade are more likely to skip the end-of-year test in a
normal year, with data missing nearly completely in the first year 2017. Moreover, the
duration between the mid-year and end-of-year test is on average 9 days longer in the

52

treatment year 2020, as is also visible in Fig. 1 of the main manuscript. In our main
analysis we include days between tests as a control variable (Section 4.2), but we show
results excluding this covariate in Section 7.12.
Table A6 shows the average performance by test, year, and student characteristics.
Boys perform better in Maths, but worse in Reading and Spelling, while both genders
perform similarly on tests of Learning readiness. Along parental education, there are
differences up to 20 percentiles between the high and lowest educated groups. Unsurprisingly, the most important predictor of performance is prior performance with the top,
middle, and bottom performers separated by on average about 20–25 percentiles each.
There are no marked differences in the rate of progress across subgroups, that is, students
belonging to various groups tend to retain their relative placement in the achievement
distribution between the mid-year and end-of-year tests. There is a consistent trend in
years prior to treatment, where relative progress between mid-year and end-of-year tests
increased by on average about a half percentile point per year. This is in turn driven
by a decline apparent in both tests, but more so in the mid-year than in the end-of-year
test. Fig. A3 presents the trend for the difference between the two tests, showing a clear
break in the treatment year 2020. In our main analysis, we assume that progress would
have continued at the same pace in absence of the pandemic. In additional analyses in
Section 7.11, we relax this assumption and present results comparing 2020 only to the
previous year 2019, assuming a flat trend.

7.1

Additional results
Regression tables

In Table A7–A11, we display regression results underlying Fig. 3 in the main manuscript,
as well as additional analyses by subject and subgroup. Table A7 displays the main effect
reported in main manuscript Fig. 3, and separate results by subject domain. Table A8
shows results by parental education for the composite score as reported in main text Fig.
3, and for separate subjects. Table A9 does the same for student sex and Table A10 does
53

so for prior performance. Table A11 displays separate analyses by grade. The results are
similar across all grades, but slightly weaker for the highest grade (age 11). This is likely
related to the large amount of missing data in this grade (Section 5.2 and Table A2).
In Table A12, we report additional regression results simultaneously controlling for all
individual-level covariates: sex, parental education, prior performance. This does little to
change the treatment effects, which is unsurprising given that treatment status is largely
unrelated to student observables (Section 6 and Table A3). In Table A13 we restrict the
sample to only those students with a valid score in all three subjects, again with similar
results. This last set of results is presented visually in Fig. A4.

7.2

Placebo analysis

In Fig. A5 we perform a placebo analysis on non-treated years. We do so by keeping
the specification identical to our main analysis but excluding the actual treatment year
and, in turn, assigning treatment status to each of the three comparison years. Doing so
reveals few significant effects, and those that are so by chance are mostly in the opposite
direction of the results reported in the main manuscript. Our identification strategy thus
appears robust to false positives, and if anything, is likely to underestimate the treatment
effect somewhat given the small bias towards a positive treatment effect in two of three
comparison years. Crucially, however, the pooled effect is not significantly different from
zero in any year. In Section 7.13 and Fig. A21, we further show (using 2019 as the
placebo year) that the placebo effect remains non-significant throughout specifications,
except for analyses that discard with our control for a linear trend in year (cf. Fig. A3).
This is a leading reason why we choose to include a control for year in analyses presented
throughout the main manuscript (Section 4.2).

7.3

Year exclusions

To confirm that our results are not driven by any one comparison year, we re-estimate
our main specification dropping comparison years one at a time. Results from these
analyses are reported in Fig. A6. Estimates are less precisely estimated but of a similar
54

magnitude and significantly different from zero throughout. Dropping the year immediately preceding treatment, 2019, reduces both the precision and the magnitude of the
estimated treatment effects somewhat. This is driven by the absence of a clear trend
in Maths achievement between 2017 and 2018, as shown in Fig. A3. The size of the
estimated learning loss in Reading and Spelling remain undiminished. Moreover, the
qualitative results remain unchanged across all these year exclusions. Specifically, the
difference in effect size between students from high- and low-educated homes remains of
a similar magnitude and is significant at the 0.1% level throughout these analyses.

7.4

Covariate balancing

In Table A12, we report regression results including individual-level control variables.
To adjust for a larger set of observables, including school characteristics and potential
higher-order interactions, in Fig A7–A8 we further implement propensity score weighting and balancing using maximum entropy weights (Section 4.2). In these analyses we
include the same individual-level covariates as earlier—sex, parental education, prior
performance—but also two- and three-way interactions between them, a student’s school
grade, and school-level covariates: school denomination, school disadvantage, and neighborhood ethnic composition. Fig. A7 shows that both the entropy balancing and the
propensity score weighting method achieve a sample that is balanced on the relevant characteristics. Fig. A8 displays our main results using each weighting method. Regardless
of weighting schemes, both estimates of learning loss are highly similar and correspond
closely to our main specification as reported in Fig. 3 of the main manuscript.

7.5

Near-complete schools

Our re-weighted analyses in Section 7.4 adjust extensively for observed covariates. Still,
given the high loss to follow-up apparent in Table A2, selection on unobservables may
nevertheless remain. As one way to address this issue, we repeat our baseline analysis
while restricting the sample to only those schools where at least 75% of students were
tested across both testing occasions in the treatment year (mid-year vs end-of-year).
55

Table A14 reports the pooled treatment effect using this restriction, while Table A15
displays differential impacts by parental education. Fig. A9 presents the results for these
and other subgroups visually. All results remains significant at the 0.1% level and close
in magnitude to our original analysis. The overall treatment effect and disparities by
parental education are, if anything, slightly larger than in our baseline analysis. This
difference in effect size with respect to our baseline analysis is not statistically significant.
Nevertheless, it bears noting that the direction of this difference is the opposite from
what we would expect if results were driven by selective loss to follow-up.

7.6

School fixed effects

Another way to address selective loss to follow-up is by introducing school-level fixed
effects (Section 4.2). This design discards all variation between schools which might have
biased our results if, for example, schools that perform worse in previous years are overrepresented in the treatment year. Table A16 shows results adding school fixed effects,
while Table A17 does so for the interaction by parental education. Again, the estimated
treatment effect is significant at the 0.1% level and remains similar in magnitude to
our estimates reported in the main text. As in the analysis of near-complete schools in
Section 7.5, both the overall treatment effect and disparities by parental education grow
somewhat relative to the baseline set of results. Again, however, differences with respect
to the baseline model are not statistically significant. In Fig. A10 we display the results
for these and other subgroups visually. This plot confirms that our other results remain
similar, and all qualitative conclusions remain unchanged.

7.7

Family fixed effects

Using a similar logic as in Section 7.6 above, we estimate fixed-effects models that discard all variation between families by introducing a separate intercept for each group of
siblings identified in our data (Section 4.2). The results are displayed in Table A18–A19
and visually in Fig. A11. In many ways, the family fixed-effects design is our most powerful way to adjust for differential attrition between comparison and treatment years. It
56

removes any sources of heterogeneity that make siblings more similar than randomly chosen individuals, whether due to observed or unobserved factors. The tradeoff is that we
have to restrict the sample to treated students where either they or a sibling is observed
in a comparison year, which reduces our sample size by roughly 70%. This makes the
estimates less stable, especially in the analyses by grade (Fig. A11). Nevertheless, the results remain qualitatively similar, and differences by parental education are larger in this
specification than in any other. This could be due either to the removal of family-level
heterogeneity or to the different sample used in this analysis. To address this question, in
Table A20–A21 we re-estimate our baseline specification but using the same subsample
as for the family fixed effects. Doing so reveals results of a similar magnitude, suggesting
that differences with respect to our main set of results are primarily due to the different
sample.

7.8

Learning readiness

As an alternative outcome, we assess students’ performance on short 3-minute tests in
speed reading that are meant to test their learning readiness (Section 3.1). These tests
are not designed to assess any part of the taught curriculum, but are taken in conjunction
with the other tests and under similar circumstances. If our main estimates of learning
loss reflect the cumulative impact of knowledge learned, we would expect these effects
to be small or zero. In contrast, if our estimates of learning loss mainly reflect “day of
exam” effects due to stress exposure, testing conditions, or lack of familiarity with the
school setting, we would expect similarly large losses on both kinds of test. Fig. A12,
top panel, reveals that the treatment effect on this outcome is on average 62% smaller
than for our main outcome. Fig. A12, bottom panel, shows that this is not the case in
a non-treatment year, where estimated null effects on the both tests are instead closely
similar. We therefore conclude that “day of exam” effects are unlikely to be the main
explanation for our results.

57

7.9

School variability

While school closures were deployed nationwide, the circumstances surrounding online
learning were largely a matter for individual schools to handle. It is therefore likely that
the response differed widely at the school level. Fig. A13–A14 report estimates from a
mixed-effects model that lets the estimated learning loss differ between schools (Section
4.2). The results reveal considerable variation, with some schools seeing a learning slide of
10 percentiles or more, and others recording no losses or even small gains. In both cases,
we plot the predicted school-level treatment effects against school-level socioeconomic
disadvantage and the share of non-Western immigrants in the school neighborhood. The
socioeconomic disadvantage scores are a composite that incorporates the education level,
country of origin, duration of residence, and economic hardship of all parents in the
school (Section 3.2). Losses are larger in schools with a high proportion of disadvantaged
students and of immigrant background (Fig. A13), and this holds further when adjusting
for individual-level covariates (Fig. A14).

7.10

Three-way interactions

In our main analysis, we find little evidence that the impact of the pandemic differs
along any other dimension than parental education. Here we ask whether the greater
vulnerability among students from less-educated homes is especially pronounced in some
groups. For example, a commonly held hypothesis is that boys may display greater
vulnerability to socioeconomic disadvantage (107 –109 ). However, Table A26 reveals that
the differential impact by parental education in our sample does not differ significantly
by gender. Table A27 further breaks down the parental education differential in learning
loss by prior performance. The absence of differential effects by prior performance is
surprising in light of the fact that it correlates with parental education. Given this
correlation, we would expect that a larger learning loss among children from less-educated
homes translates into a corresponding difference by prior performance. Our analysis in
Table A27 resolves this puzzle by showing that losses are especially concentrated among
students from less-educated homes who performed well in the previous year.
58

7.11

Trend assumption

Fig. A3 shows that the rate of progress between the two tests increased incrementally in
the years prior to the pandemic. By controlling for a linear trend in year (Section 4.2), our
main analysis assumes a counterfactual where the trend apparent in pre-treatment years
would have continued unabated in absence of the pandemic. In Table A22–A23 and Fig.
A15 we replace this assumption by comparing the treatment year only to the previous
year, 2019, and assuming a flat trend. We put less trust in this specification than that of
our main analysis because, as Fig. A21 shows, it produces a spurious positive effect when
applied to placebo years. This leads us to think that it will underestimate learning loss
due to the pandemic. Indeed, Table A22 shows that the estimated treatment effect shrinks
somewhat using this strategy, by about 21%. Nevertheless, the absolute differences in
learning loss by parental education remain of a similar magnitude (Table A23). Fig. A15
also shows that learning losses in Maths appear undiminished, while the reduction is
driven by Spelling and Reading. Other results remain qualitatively unchanged.

7.12

Days between tests

As shown in the main manuscript, Fig. 1, one salient difference between comparison and
treatment years is that testing was delayed due to the pandemic school closures. Table
A3 reveals that the end-of-year tests occurred on average 9 days later relative to the
mid-year test in the treatment year. In our main analysis we choose to adjust for this
fact by including a linear control term for the number of days between tests (Section
4.2). Table A1 shows that instruction time in a normal year has a positive effect on
students’ test scores. It is therefore possible that part of our estimated learning loss is
attributable to the choice of including this variable as a control term. We address this
question in Table A24–A25 and Fig. A16, where we estimate models identical to our
baseline specification but excluding the number of days between tests. Doing so, the
estimated treatment effect shrinks by about 12% (Table A24). The absolute differences
in learning loss by parental education remain undiminished (Table A25). Fig. A16 shows
that our other results likewise remain qualitatively unchanged.
59

7.13

Specification curve

In the foregoing, we have tested various departures from our preferred specification by
varying one model component at a time. A more exhaustive way to assess the robustness
of results is to run all possible specifications that arise from combinations of analytical
choices. Here we do so using a specification curve analysis (44 ). The underlying idea is
to: 1) list the different analytical options that a researcher encounters in specifying the
model, 2) define a model space based on all possible or reasonable combinations of these
options, and 3) examine how the parameter of interest varies across the complete model
space. We let the specification vary according to the following criteria:
• Individual controls: Whether to adjust for sex, parental education, prior performance, and school grade and different combinations thereof.
• Interactions: Whether the model includes interaction terms, including potential
higher-order interactions, and different combinations thereof.
• Sample period: Whether to use all three comparison years (assuming a linear trend)
or only compare the treatment year to the previous year (assuming the trend is flat).
• Fixed effects: Whether to include fixed effects at the school level, at the family
level, or no fixed effects.
• Days between tests: Whether to adjust for the time elapsed between testing dates
or not.
Fig. A17 displays more than 2,000 alternative treatment effect estimates for our main
outcome, one for each model that arises from all combinations of the choices above.
Estimated learning loss is broadly within the range from 2 to 3.5 percentiles. The most
consequential choice turns out to be the inclusion of a linear trend in year. Excluding this
term reduces the size of estimates as we have already showed in Section 7.11. Nevertheless,
we prefer our main specification which includes this term, for reasons that appear in Fig.
A21: applying the same set of specifications to a placebo year produces a spurious positive
effect, which is not the case with our preferred specification (Section 7.2). The next most
60

important pattern is that estimates grow in size when fixed effects at the school level,
and (particularly) at the family level, are included. However, the larger effects in withinfamily analyses are in part attributable to the fact a smaller and selected portion of the
sample is used (Section 7.7). Fig. A18– A20 repeats the specification curve exercise
for each of the tree subjects: Maths, Spelling, and Reading. Results in Maths emerge
as particularly robust to specification, while those in Spelling are the most sensitive.
Conclusions about the model components which have most influence are broadly similar
across these outcomes.
