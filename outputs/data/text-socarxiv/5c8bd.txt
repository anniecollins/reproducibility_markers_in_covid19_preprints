COVID-19 Sex-Age Mortality Modeling:
A Use Case of Risk-Based Vaccine Prioritization
Vladimir Shapiro
Northeastern University, Boston, MA

Abstract
This research builds upon the previous publications claiming that the male sex population and both sex
individuals of advanced age are more susceptible to COVID-19’s risks. Relations between sex and age
gradients are explored analytically based upon the proposed log-polynomial regression model of COVID-19
mortality. This model enables predicting mortality risk at any arbitrary age, as well as the derivation of
several useful secondary metrics:
•
Sex differential: a ratio of male-to-female death risks for a given age group.
•
Age parity: age at which both sexes have an equal vulnerability.
•
Age lag: the number of years to subtract from a male’s age to match a female’s death risk.
•
Male equal risk age: male’s age at which male’s odds of dying from COVID-19 will equate female’s
given the cutoff age.
These metrics allow solving such practical problems as, e.g., prioritizing vaccine based on COVID-19
mortality risk associated with sex and age. Modeling techniques, refined in the paper, are by no means
unique to COVID-19 and would apply to analyses of other diseases.

1. Introduction
As the world plows through the subsequent waves of the COVID-19, scientists are busy analyzing the data
and uncovering trends in attempts to minimize losses of human lives and disruptions to the economies.
In this paper, we will focus here on the most fundamental demographic characteristics such as age and sex to
help us solving some practical problems. There have been numerous recent publications by e.g.
(Demombynes 2020; Guilmoto 2020; Ng et al. 2020), supporting the following principal trends related to
age and sex:
•
Older populations are at higher COVID-19 death risks.
•
Males are generally more vulnerable than females of the same age.
Progress has been made in researching the age gradients of COVID-19 deaths and quantification of the sex
differential (SD) see e.g. (Guilmoto 2020). In other sources, the sex differential is referred to as M/F (maleto-female ratio), see (Sobotka et al., 2020), or GMR (gender mortality ratio), see (Ng et al. 2020). The main
research tool, employed by scientists, has been the linear regression applied to the stratified death counts to
100,000 of the general population of each sex on a logarithmic scale. However powerful, the linear
regression has several limitations:
• It ignores the fact that the straight line rarely fits the stratified death counts on a logarithmic scale
optimally; there is a subtle curvature that the data point outline would naturally have, see e.g., Figure
4, which is not captured by a straight line. While limiting the regression to its linear form is
convenient, it becomes a constraint when it comes to identifying trends and making more accurate
predictions between the available data points (age groups) or beyond the last age groups of 80+ or
90+.
• It implies that all the age groups have equal death counts (“weights”), as the OLS (Ordinary Least
Square) is used for fitting. The latter minimizes the sum of square differences between the observed
and the fitted values thus ignoring the vastly higher relative weight of the older age death counts
compared to the younger ones.
The research below is aiming at suggesting alternatives that are more adequate for the problems at hand.
Still, on the subject of the regression fit, there is another aspect that had attracted insufficient attention in the
literature. Namely, selection of a “representative” value (age) for a given age group (bin/bucket), used in the
fitting. We are discussing this subject in Chapter 2.4.
Upon having refined the modeling methodology, this research aims at further exploration of such metrics as
age parity and age lag introduced in (Shapiro 2020), which are alternative metrics that describe different
aspects of the sex-age mortality relations. The latter concept facilitates solving such a practical problem as
the COVID-19 mortality risk-based vaccine prioritization of population strata based on age and sex in a
fashion tailored to a given country, see Chapter 2.4.3. Out of several popular vaccine allocation criteria, see
(Ferranna et al, 2021) ours is to decrease mortality as much as possible.

2. Modeling
The data, used in this research, originates from nine European countries and the US; all taken from the top
of the list of the most severely affected by the COVID-19 with a total of over 900 thousand fatal outcomes
as of March 2021 (INED 2021) making the dataset representative from both numerical and geographical
diversity standpoints. The countries in question bear similarities from the population structure and other
perspectives, and the identified trends are applicable to many of them as well as others not considered here.
By now a trove of national COVID-19 mortality datasets is publicly available. We defined the following
criteria for dataset selection:
•
Trustworthiness of a source.
•
The minimum death count for a given country of at least 10K,
•
Sufficient granularity (<= 10-year intervals) – larger age intervals will not be suitable for robust
2

•
•

modeling presenting too sparsely located data points.
Half-open oldest age interval (histogram bin) to be 80+ or older – death counts for this and all older
ages are aggregated in the latter. Allowing the right-most interval to shift to even younger ages will
risk making this interval dominate thus distorting the trend.
Deaths are counted separately for each sex – we excluded some nation datasets that would aggregate
both sexes in a single count.

Aggregated (binned) into 5- or 10-year age groups, all datasets have been procured from (INED 2021) and
are based on the United Nations and national government agencies’ input; all are available in open access.
The only exception is the unique Czech Republic’s single-year datasets sourced from (Czech Statistical
Office 2019, MZČR Onemocnění Aktuálně 2021), also openly accessible. The countries under consideration
have been through several pandemic waves; their fatality counts are numerous enough to manifest wellestablished trends.
2.1.

Log-Polynomial Model

The polynomial regression in the logarithmic space, i.e. log-polynomial, see eq. (1), would be more accurate
and thus suitable fit than the customary simple regression log-linear model e.g. (Demombynes 2020;
Guilmoto 2020). We limited the polynomial to the 2nd degree to avoid the model overfitting the data:
(1)

log(𝑦𝑦) = 𝑏𝑏0 + 𝑏𝑏1 𝑥𝑥 + 𝑏𝑏2 𝑥𝑥 2 ,

where 𝑦𝑦 represents a death count for a given age group 𝑥𝑥 standardized (stratified) per 100,000 of given sex
in the general population (INED 2021).

Instead of the conventional log-linear model, it is possible to fit Poisson regression models. As stated in
(Cheng et al, 2016): “Poisson regression, a generalized linear model, is appropriate for modeling …
mortality rates”. In its basic form the log-linear form of the Poisson regression has been used (Cheng et al,
2016, Tai and Noymer, 2018), which, just as the simple linear regression, is not complex enough to fit the
non-linear nature of the COVID-19 death counts versus age distribution. There have been attempts to
address that. An equation similar to Eq. 1 for the stratified death counts, are referred to as Poisson regression
with e.g., “quadratic age effect” (Currie 2013) in the context of modeling mortality rates (death counts) as a
function of age, or “age quadratic” (Andersen 2019, Atkinson et al 2008) when modeling lung cancer case
numbers versus age.
2.1.1. Ordinary (OLS) versus Weighted (WOLS) Regression
Let us look closer at the mortality data plotted in Figure 1 (the same applies to the non-stratified data on e.g.,
Figure 7). The height of each bin there represents a number of fatalities (deaths) for a given age group. In
other words, behind a data point at the age group of say 30-39 years, there are only a handful of deaths,
whereas, behind the age group of say 80-89, there are thousands. For instance, in Germany both sex
COVID-19 deaths for the age group of 80-89 years are 46.4% of the total versus just 0.2% for 30-39 years;
the trend is very similar for the other countries observed such as for the Czech Republic, shown in Figure 1,
where the death counts are proportional to the black circle diameters. This information would be implicitly
ignored if we were to fit an OLS (Ordinary Least Square) regression, as put in “A set of unweighted normal
equations for a least-squares solution assumes that the response variable of each equation is equally
reliable and should be treated equally” (Shin 2013). OLS implies that each data point error (residual)
contribution to the total OLS error is equal.
There are other, non-COVID-19, situations when some data points are more important than others, e.g. time
series where the impact of the latest data may be valued higher (Wang, etc. 2020); data from some
geographic areas may be more important than from others (Kala, etc. 2017), etc. As indicated in (Willett and
Singer, 1988) “different weights are assigned to different observation in order to recognize that some
3

observations are `better` or `stronger` than others”. In our context of using regression fit for predicting
COVID-19 mortality behavior for various age groups, the intuition suggests that those data points
(histogram bins) that represent a large number of deaths are weighed “heavier” than others with a lot fewer
deaths as in the case of younger ages.
In the context of COVID-19 death counts the lack of uniformity is more than obvious, see e.g. Figure 7(e,f)
where stratified histograms are displayed for the Czech Republic; other country’s trends are very similar.
Another observation that stresses asymmetry between the data points, in this case, the groups of such, is that
data points (age bins) of all three data point weights of “40-49”, “50-59”, “60-69” contain just around 3% of
the total death count; whereas another three data points of “70-79”, “80-89”, “90-99” – around 96%. One
can easily imagine that the OLS regression would unjustifiably boost the “40-69” range while suppressing
the one of “70-99”, causing the trend line slope tracking better in the younger ages where it matters less, and
worse at older ages when it matters more, see Figure 1. The WOLS-fitted polynomials tend to have greater
curvature than OLS ones.
For the rest of the paper, we will be applying the WOLS fitting technique 1.

(b)

The OLS fit tracks closer to the low weight younger ages while the WOLS better fits the older ages data
points in Figure 1. Note that the R2 (the goodness of fit) may or may not improve as a result of applying the
WOLS. As noted in (Willett and Singer, 1988) the focus should be “particularly the increased precision of
Instead of WOLS, it would be possible to apply the weighting approach to the quadratic age Poisson regression model. We left
this comparison out of scope assuming that superiority of WOLS over the Poisson log-linear regression models established in (Tai
and Noymer, 2018) would hold if an extra quadratic term is added
4 to each model. However, this deserves further exploration.

the estimates of β” (regression coefficients) delivered by the WOLS, the method behind the calculation of
the weighted regression, rather than the R2 value.
As expected, it appears from Figure 1 that the weighted fit better follows the trend if the bin count (weight) is
taken into account. It is not clear, however, how close the weighted regression on the 10-year age bin
dataset approximates the single-year one. As mentioned above, the Czech Republic data are available in the
single-year resolution along with the 10-year; the only exception was the “100+” age group which is a
single consolidated data point. For the sake of simplicity, we excluded from consideration this “100+” data
point (more on the subject in Chapter 2.4) as well as the very young ages with insignificant death counts.
We used that in Figure 2 below which shows the WFS fit to the 10-year bin size (in red), and single-year (in
blue) to the highest resolution single-year. One can see that the 10-year-based fit closely tracks the singleyear one including the major data points, shown with circles. Whatever the bin resolution we can notice that
the WFS fit the heavy-weight old age data points nicely.

2.2. Methods: Sex Differential and Age Parity
The subject of the sex differential (SD), shown in red in Figure 3, in relation to COVID-19 deaths for age
gradients has been studied and quantified in e.g. (Guilmoto 2020, Sobotka et al. 2020, Ng et al. 2020,
Demombynes 2020).

𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 is depicted as a vertical gap, shown as a function of age. The formal equation for 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 is:

𝑀𝑀
𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎

𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎

Let us rename 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 (𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎) as 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 (Fatality Sex Ratio), often referred to as the M/F ratio in e.g.
(Sobotka et al. 2020),
𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 = 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 (𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎)

(3)

Having regression model fitted (Eq. (1)) to male’s and female’s fatality count data, 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 or 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑥𝑥 can be
rewritten to express it analytically, namely:
𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑥𝑥 = log(𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝑥𝑥𝑀𝑀 ) − log(𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝑥𝑥𝐹𝐹 ) = 𝑦𝑦 𝑀𝑀 − 𝑦𝑦 𝐹𝐹 =
(𝑏𝑏0𝑀𝑀 − 𝑏𝑏0𝐹𝐹 ) + (𝑏𝑏1𝑀𝑀 − 𝑏𝑏1𝐹𝐹 )𝑥𝑥 + (𝑏𝑏2𝑀𝑀 − 𝑏𝑏2𝐹𝐹 )𝑥𝑥 2

Using Eq. (4) we can predict the age “parity”, 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 , for the 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑥𝑥 , i.e., the age at which
the male’s odds of dying will be on par with the female’s, see Figure 3b. For this we need to
solve the (𝑏𝑏0𝑀𝑀 − 𝑏𝑏0𝐹𝐹 ) + (𝑏𝑏1𝑀𝑀 − 𝑏𝑏1𝐹𝐹 )𝑥𝑥 + (𝑏𝑏2𝑀𝑀 − 𝑏𝑏2𝐹𝐹 )𝑥𝑥 2 = 0 equation for 𝑥𝑥, i.e., age in years.
The condition of 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑥𝑥 = 0 will only occur if the female’s “advantage” declines at an older
age. The results for individual countries are shown in Figure 4 and Table 1.

2.2.1. Advantages of Weighted Regression Beyond COVID-19
Sex-related discrepancies are not unique to COVID-19. Specific sex differentials may vary for different
diseases (Mauvais-Jarvis et al. 2020; Harvard Health 2021,). Ng et al. (2020) report ratios of 1.3 – 2 for allcause mortalities; compare to 2 - 3 for COVID-19 (Guilmoto 2020). Therefore, scientists will continue
researching sex discrepancies with respect to mortality long after the COVID-19 pandemic is over. And
fitting regression functions to mortality age gradients will keep on being a useful tool for data modeling and
analysis regardless of the death cause. For these reasons getting the regression right and honing the tools is
very relevant.
The use of WOLS is justified always whenever the data point (age bin) weights are not uniformly
distributed. Many decease’ age gradients (“mortality trajectory”) or general mortality follows the Gompertz
law (Gavrilov and Gavrilova, 2011), which implies a heavy disbalance in weights age-wise. Moreover, the
death age distribution of many disease’s outbursts is non-uniform either, e.g. the Spanish flu of 1918
(Gagnon 2013), or 2009 pandemic influenza (Karageorgopoulos 2011) with distinct age gradients compared
to COVID-19, would all benefit from using the weighted regression instead of the conventional OLS.
2.3. Methods: Age Lag
Male fatality COVID-19 deaths (risks) are generally higher than female’s (Demombynes 2020; Guilmoto
𝑀𝑀
𝐹𝐹
2020; Ng et al. 2020). Given a male fatality risk 𝑦𝑦𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎
and same age female’s 𝑦𝑦𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎
, the following holds for
𝑀𝑀
𝐹𝐹
most ages: 𝑦𝑦𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 - 𝑦𝑦𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 = 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 > 0. That is the male’s risk of dying from COVID-19 is usually higher
than the female’s of the same age. How much younger a male should be (t in years) to “compensate” for the
𝑀𝑀
𝐹𝐹
sex differential 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 , i.e., to equalize the risks: 𝑦𝑦𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎
= 𝑦𝑦𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎+
𝑡𝑡𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 ? This way a male younger by 𝑡𝑡𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 will
have an equal risk of dying from COVID-19. Therefore, we are referring to this 𝑡𝑡𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 as the “age lag”
𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 , which is depicted in Figure 3a as a horizontal gap shown in green. Age lag shows by how many years
( 𝑡𝑡𝑥𝑥 ) we need to shift the x (“age”) of a male to achieve the risk parity with a female of age x. 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 denoted
as 𝑡𝑡𝑥𝑥 in Eq. (5) can be derived from the log-polynomial model analytically at any given age x as:
𝑀𝑀
(5)
𝑦𝑦𝑥𝑥𝐹𝐹 = 𝑦𝑦𝑥𝑥+
𝑡𝑡𝑥𝑥 , or
𝑏𝑏0𝐹𝐹 + 𝑏𝑏1𝐹𝐹 𝑥𝑥 + 𝑏𝑏2𝐹𝐹 𝑥𝑥 2 = 𝑏𝑏0𝑀𝑀 + 𝑏𝑏1𝑀𝑀 (𝑥𝑥 + 𝑡𝑡𝑥𝑥 ) + 𝑏𝑏2𝑀𝑀 (𝑥𝑥 + 𝑡𝑡𝑥𝑥 )2 ,

Finally, 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 , i. e. 𝑡𝑡𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 , is a solution to the quadratic equation for any desirable 𝑥𝑥 (age):
𝑏𝑏2𝑀𝑀 𝑡𝑡𝑥𝑥 2

+

(6)

We can see from Figure 5 that the age lag 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 typically has a “U”-shape later in life. Interpretation of say
𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴70 = 𝑡𝑡70 = −10 is that the odds for the lethal outcome of a 70 years-old female are equal to those of a
60 years-old male. The interpretation of 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 = 𝑡𝑡𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 = 0 is that males and females of the same age have
equal risks of dying from COVID-19. 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 = 0 occurs at the age of parity 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 .

(b)

The pattern emerging in Figure 5 shows the maximum negative 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 to vary in the range of [-5, -10] for a
wider interval of ranges from 45 to 80. After that, the trend reverses: for ages older than 80 the 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎
narrows until reaches 0 around the age of 100 with some exceptions in both directions. This is obviously in
line with the 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 that we calculated in Chapter 2.2 and plotted in Figure 4.
The 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 functions for Germany and the Czech Republic stand out and require a closer look, see Figure
6. In the case of Germany, the female (yellow) regression polynomial is closing in on the male’s (black)
with age and getting as close 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 = 0.04985 on the logarithmic scale or 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 (Fatality Sex Ratio,
M/F ratio) of 1.12 at the age of 139 but never reaches the 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 exactly. The Czech Republic
female’s regression polynomial (red) does cross the male’s (blue) at just over 124 years, which happens
after the male’s curve has bent downward. Flatter portions of the curves at ages over 100 years may be
less practical from the age lag perspective. A much more robust metric is the parity age (𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 )
which takes into account all the data points (𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 is calculated for every value of age separately, see
Figure 6). At the 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 , the 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 = 0 by definition.

2.4. Representative Values for Mortality Count Buckets (Bins)
COVID-19 mortality counts are usually binned into 5- or 10-year ranges in the publicly available age-sex
datasets, e.g. (INED 2021). Besides, the half-open oldest age intervals (bins) vary from “80+” to “100+”
depending on the country. Likewise, the population data, needed for calculating stratified death counts,
typically also comes binned. In absence of more granular data, a single data point, usually the bin center, can
be taken as an independent variable (age) estimate or the value representative of that bin (age interval)
(INED 2021). For instance, the bin of, say, ages of “60-69”, the center of the bin i.e., 65, would be used in
fitting a regression polynomial. The author has not found the subject discussed in the literature sources that
fitted regression lines to COVID-19 mortality counts. Andersen (2019) used the bin centers, i.e., “age (midpoint of ranges)”. Demombynes (2020), Goldstein & Lee (2020) had not elaborated on the subject
explicitly, but if judged by the plots, they used the left boundary of the bin as a representative age value, e.g.
“70” for the “70-79” bin and “80” for the half-open interval of “80+”. A similar approach regarding the last
interval is adopted in (Ng et al. 2020). We have not found any discussion of whether there is a need for a
special attitude towards the half-open bin in the literature. The line of thinking may have been that if the
representative age for the half-open interval is consistently taken at the left boundary, e.g., “80” for the
“80+”, things will work out. The problem here is that it is one thing when “80” represents the closed interval
of “80-89”, and the other when the same “80” represents the half-open of “80+”. For instance, in Germany,
46.6% (stratified) of COVID-19 deaths belong to the “80-89” age group, but would be 69.8% if the oldest
age bin were “80+”. This is because 23.3% belong to “90+” (INED 2021); similar proportions can be
observed for the Czech Republic in Figure 10(b). All that shows that using “80” as the representative value all
across “80-84”, “80-89”, or “80+” is problematic. Our simulations in Figure 9 show what kinds of
2

𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 is so low Germany because the regressions for male and female for Figure 4 (a –

right) show the largest sex differential at the early ages, where it is less of interest.

The Czech Republic case is discussed in the subsequent
10 paragraph in more detail.

distortions it causes.
There are two questions to explore in this chapter:
• For the closed intervals of ages, e.g., “0-9”, “10-19”, etc.: given the mortality count distribution is
non-linear and asymmetric, would the bin center be a reasonable estimate?
• For the open intervals of ages, e.g., “80+”, “90+”, etc.: what age data point should be used for
regression? Several factors would affect the answer. What would be the impact on modeling the
data for the countries that report differently structured open intervals?
To help us answer the questions we will refer to the unique (to the author’s knowledge) case of the Czech
Republic. What makes the latter unique is the fact that it provides access (MZČR Onemocnění Aktuálně
2021) to a very granular COVID-19 mortality data having an exact age at death with a single-year resolution
for each sex. This is one part of the equation, we also need the population data to stratify the death counts,
and here again the nearly perfectly organized data with a single-year age resolution are available in (Czech
Statistical Office 2019) for each sex.
Unfortunately, no granular single-year population data are available for the age over 100 in (Czech
Statistical Office 2019) dataset, therefore we excluded the “100” data bucket below. There are only a few
dozens of COVID-19 in the Czech Republic in ages over 100 at the time of writing, therefore, we preferred
the perfectly stratified data for all ages under 100. This simplifies and streamlines the experiment while
keeping the impact minimal. Below, we treat the regression fit to the single-year age resolution age
histogram as a virtually “ideal”, considering that it is by far the best COVID-19 and population data that can
be realistically obtained at this moment. As such it is used as a baseline in our exploration of the binning
methods.
The conventional technique of binning data into 5- or 10-year bins instead of the high-resolution raw data
may be convenient for multiple reasons, or the only available one as the case of COVID-19 and
demographic data which is aggregated by the agencies supplying the data. Exceptions are the half-open
intervals for the oldest age. The purpose would be to see how well the centers of the bins would allow fitting
the “ideal” full resolution stratified mortality histogram.

We can see in Figure 7, Figure 8 that centers of the age intervals seem to be representing the means for a given
histogram bin reasonably well (the means are displayed with thin brown vertical bars with the values at the
top of the bars). We claim that because:
• The mean values are situated very close to the bin centers, see Figure 8 (a-d).
• The regression lines and the RMSEs are reasonably close to each other, which confirms the validity
of the conventional approach, see the 90+ version of the dataset, see Figure 8 (a,b).
Figure 8 (c-d) is another story because of the half-open oldest age interval of 80+, to be discussed below.
2.4.1. Half-Open Oldest Age Intervals
The half-open oldest age intervals of 80+, 90+ have interval center undetermined. Estimating the mean for it
may be possible with the Czech Republic single-year dataset, but not with the binned into 5- or 10-year bin
datasets for other countries (INED 2021).
• With no aggregation, i.e., 90+, regression error RMSE of the regression fitted to the centers and the
means is a virtual tie, as both regression lines are very close to the ideal fit (shown in beige).
• With more aggressive data aggregation, i.e., 80+, the issue becomes obvious as the center RMSE
skyrockets compared to the RMSE of regression fitted to the means. Apparent reason to it is that the
actual mean of the open interval is 91.8 years for male and 92.3 for female, i.e., outside of the 10year interval of 80-89.
• Note that the actual impact would depend on the population structure of a given country.
2.4.2. Left Boundary as a Representative Value for Age Intervals
We mentioned earlier that some authors, e.g. (Demombynes 2020, Ng et al. 2020, Goldstein & Lee 2020)
seemingly used the left boundary of the age interval as13a representative value. Let us check the regression

error compared to the ideal fit, see Figure 9. One can notice much higher regression errors RMSE compared
to the bin means, and even to the bin centers from Figure 8 for all levels of aggregation and both sexes. While
for 90+ the left-boundary-based regression manages to track the trend albeit there is a noticeable gap
between it and the ideal fit; for 80+ everything is off including the trend.

to the bin means, shown with relevant RMSE for the full-resolution regression.

2.4.3. Recommendations for Selection of the Representative Value for Age Intervals
There are two recommendations from the analysis above:

1. When fitting regression to age-sex mortality use either center or means of the age bins if the means are available.
2. For the half-open interval for the oldest age use the mean if the assessment of such is possible. In absence of the
latter, use the means calculated for the Czech Republic in Table 3.

Mean locations depend on the bucketing of the oldest age death counts into the half-open interval. Table 3
has the means calculated for the Czech Republic simulations with various half-open intervals. They depend
on the population structure of the country, as well as on the COVID-19 death age-sex structure, see e.g.,
these for the Czech Republic in Figure 10. The most surprising finding is that the means for 80+ and 95+
intervals are situated much further away from the expected ones.
In our experiments, we have applied values from the last row in Table 3 for both sexes for all country
datasets, which implicitly assumes similarity with the Czech Republic. The latter assumption relies on the
fact that the Czech Republic profile is similar to many of the observed countries, as it belongs to the same
demographic cluster, situated in the same geographic region, etc. Besides, this was the only option that was
supported by the data. Further research is needed here, and having more granular datasets from the other
nation’s authorities would help in the process tremendously.

3. A Use Case of the Age Lag: COVID-19 Vaccine Prioritization
Many countries, states, and municipalities are actively rolling out public vaccination campaigns these days.
An important question is how to prioritize different strata of the population to minimize the risks to the
public as a whole. Ferranna et al (2021) compiled a table of various goals stated by government institutions
that are in charge of setting policies and priorities for vaccine allocation in individual countries (US, UK)
and worldwide (WHO). Such goals vary from the more obvious ‘reduce mortality” to the less e.g., “reduce
negative societal impact, mitigate of health inequities, treat people fairly, minimize impact”. Based on the
goals stated above certain countries would choose to prioritize higher certain occupations, e.g., high-risk
health workers and first responders, personnel in long-term facilities, racial or ethnical minority status of
population groups, their socioeconomical vulnerability etc., (Ferranna et al, 2021). Out of all possible
considerations our approach aims at minimizing the overall mortality based on age and sex, while respecting
other considerations and leaving it up to the policymakers to apply our recommendations selectively.
Age-based approach has been incorporated into virtually all known prioritization schemes, namely:
• Three age-based tiers in the US: “75+”, “65-74”, “16-64” for all the sexes (CDC 2021). Many US
states are implementing more granular age cutoffs.
• Four in Germany: “80+”, “70-79”, “60-69”, “<60” (Cylus 2021)
• Eight age-based tiers in the UK: “80+”, “75-79”, “70-74”, “65-69”, “60-64”, “55-59”, “50-54”,
“<50” (Priority Groups 2020, Ferranna et al, 2021).
• “Israel’s initial age cut-off of 60 years and over… Estonia focuses first on those 70 years and over“
(Cylus 2021).
15

A general remark to all the reasoning in this chapter. We are assuming no differences between the sexes in
all other aspects that may affect COVID-19 mortality, like comorbidities, race, origin, occupation, virus
load, etc.
Regardless of the small variations among individual countries, the age-based “unisex” policy dominated the
risk-based vaccination priority. World Health Organization (WHO SAGE 2020) acknowledging that
“…there is evidence that the risk of severe disease and death is higher in males than in females, particularly
in older age groups“ in “Gender Considerations” chapter advised against prioritization based on gender to
not “…exacerbate underlying gender-based inequities”. Bubar et al (2021) mentioned sex among other
factors affecting COVID-19 mortality, but have not included it in their model. There is an obvious
contradiction here; higher prioritization of the older ages would undoubtedly reduce the overall risk, and
ignoring sex-related risk discrepancy is a step in the wrong direction. The latter conclusion becomes obvious
after we got to understand how the sex discrepancy directly translates into the age lag, see Figure 3: ignoring
the male sex for prioritization is equivalent to ignoring age differences of say 5-10 years. And ignoring the
age differences for the same se goes against the consensus; see Table 2 and Figure 5 for specific values of the
age lag. The truly optimal strategy would be to incorporate the sex factor in the risk assessment; this way
males would have been prioritized higher than the females of equal ages. We can see that this might have
been a tough sale from the political perspective, especially when the subject of gender equity/equality is near
the top of the public agenda. Advocating “preferences” for males is challenging in such an environment, but
it would save lives.
From the pure risk perspective, we could use the Age Lag methodology from Chapter 2.3 to answer
questions like e.g. “what is the male’s age at which his risk of dying from COVID-19 is equal to female’s at
80 ?”. To calculate it one should plug 𝑥𝑥 = 80 into Eq. (6) to obtain 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴80 . Instead of 80, any countryspecific age cut-off (set of cut-offs) could be used, ideally derived from the COVID-19 mortality statistics
for this given country. Namely, the Male Equal Risk for the age of 80, i.e., 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀80 , can be calculated
through 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴age as:
(7)

𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀80 = 80 + 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴80 ,
or directly by solving the quadratic equation with respect to 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀80 in:
𝑏𝑏0𝐹𝐹 + 𝑏𝑏1𝐹𝐹 80 + 𝑏𝑏2𝐹𝐹 802 = 𝑏𝑏0𝑀𝑀 + 𝑏𝑏1𝑀𝑀 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀80 + 𝑏𝑏2𝑀𝑀 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀80 2

Any specific age can be easily plugged in Eq. (7).

Making the males of ages between these shown in Table 4 wait, instead of prioritizing them along with the
females the age of 80, increases the mortality risks for the individuals. This applies to all age groups and will
result in unwarranted losses of lives.

An ideal risk-based vaccination campaign would assess in which arm each given dose should go to minimize
the overall risk. Since this is not quite practical on the 16
scale, the age-based tiers can be retained but

adjustments that would take into consideration the sex-age factors are necessary.
A typical COVID-19 age-based unisex vaccination campaign would typically roll out as a sequence of the
age-cutoff phases that would decline by 5 or 10 years at each phase (Ferranna et al, 2021, Priority Groups
2020, Cylus 2021). One such possible sequence of phases is shown in Table 5. If we were to incorporate the
sex factor, one sex-age mortality risk-based vaccination phase (i) would look like that shown in Figure 11. At
this phase-I, one of the cutoff ages from e.g. Table 5, is applied.
The conventional unisex prioritization approach carries excessive risks. One such risk zone is shown as the
hashed zone in Figure 11, this zone is excluded in the proposed sex-age-based approach and the lives of the
individuals from that zone will be likely spared unlike with the unisex approach. It would be possible to
estimate the lifesaving potential as an integral across all phases (cutoffs) in a vaccination campaign. Vaccine
efficacy would be a coefficient to the integral.
Figure 11.
The rollout of the COVID-19 sex-age mortality risk-based vaccination campaign versus the conventional “unisex” one, is
shown for phase-i.

4. Conclusion
COVID-19 mortality risks are strongly affected by sex and age proportions in a given population. To
concisely describe them analytically and facilitate dissecting trends, many scientists are fitting straight
regression lines using the OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) method to the logarithms of the death counts. The
paper has defined two goals and delivered on:
• Improve/refine the regression fitting methodology by:
o Apply a more sensitive log-polynomial regression model that is more suitable to the data at
hand.
o Apply OWS (Ordinary Weighted Least Squares) when fitting regression to accommodate for
non-even distribution of weights along with the age groups.
o Analyze the subject of the selection of representative values for death count intervals (bins)
• Introduce or further refine useful metrics that build upon the above-mentioned methodology
o Age parity, 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 , i.e., the age (in years) at which both sexes are equally vulnerable to
the COVID-19.
o Age lag, 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 , (in years) to establish parity
between male’s and female’s risks.

o Male Equal Risk, 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓_𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 , male’s age (in years) at which the risk is equal to female’s
at 𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓_𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎. MER approach allows solving such practical problems as mortality risk
prioritization of COVID-19 vaccine based on age-sex factors. A scheme of how to quantify
the expected lives saved, if such approach is adopted, is provided.
The results based on the analysis of 900,000 COVID-19 deaths from ten countries, heavily affected by the
pandemic, show that the well-established trend of male’s higher vulnerability persists for most ages.
However, with help of modeling, we can see how the trend changes and female’s vulnerability is getting
higher at very old, often unrealistic, age; the explanation of which is yet to be proposed. The modeling also
helps in decision making when prioritizing COVID-19 vaccines administrated to the population, based on
sex and age ensuring sound risk-based policy.
Virtually all the questions and data modeling methodologies discussed above are not at all specific to the
COVID-19 and can apply to analyzing the sex-age aspect of other diseases.
