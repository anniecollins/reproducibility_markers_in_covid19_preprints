Abstract

Background: As the outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a
worldwide pandemic, and it is rapidly expanding in Iran, real-time analyses of
epidemiological data are needed to increase situational awareness and inform
interventions. In this study, we built a predictive model based on the cumulative
trend of new cases and deaths for the top five provinces. We will also look at
modeling the trends for confirmed cases, deaths and recovered for the whole
country.
Method: In this study, we have chosen to apply the exponential smoothing
model to iteratively forecast future values of a regular time series from weighted
averages of past daily values. This method is exponential because the value of
each level is influenced by every preceding actual value to an exponentially
decreasing degree – more recent values are given greater weight. The available
data is too small to identify seasonal patterns and make a predictable variation
in value, such as annual fluctuation in temperature related to the season. The
trend is a tendency of the data to increase or decrease over time.
Results: If no control is applied, it is expected that over 40,000 people will be
infected in Tehran by mid-June. However, if the control measures are
successfully implemented, the COV-19 virus outbreak is expected to decline in

early April by the end of May (70 days). In the scenario, that no further actions
are implemented, the spread of COVID-19 is expected to continue slowly,
reaching 21,000 by mid-June. The same process has been applied to review the
confirmed cases, deaths and recovered dataset. The forecast has been carried out
for the next 30 days; a shorter timeframe has been selected as there is a high
probability that the Iranian New Year’s celebration, Farvardin, first month of
spring (30th March in Western calendar) will have an impact on the infection
rate following the event. The best predictive model predicts the number of
reported deaths of COVDI-19 to be between 3,000–5,000 and the number of
recovered cases between 5,000 – 30,000 from the total confirmed cases in the
range of 35,000-70,000 infected cases.

Conclusions: The Modeling of Covid-19 outbreak shows that the number of
patients and deaths is still increasing. Contagious diseases follow an exponential
model and the same be Haves this one. This is because the virus can spread to
others and finally each person turns into a carrier of the virus and transmit it to
another person. Disease control depends on disconnection and social distancing.
In addition, many factors are effective in stopping the disease. These include
citizens’ participation in the prevention process, health education, the
effectiveness of instructive traditions, environmental conditions, and so on.

Introduction:
On 31 December 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) office located in
China was informed of pneumonia of unknown etiology cases (unknown cause)
detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China. WHO reported that a novel
coronavirus (2019-nCoV), named as severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and chosen by International Committee on
Taxonomy of Viruses on 11 February 2020, was identified as the causative
virus by Chinese authorities on 7 January.(1)
During the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic, Iran reported its first confirmed
cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections on 19 February 2020 in Qom(2). As of
17 March 2020, according to Iranian health authorities, there had been 988
COVID-19 deaths in Iran with more than 16,000 confirmed infections(3,4,5)
This respiratory disease caused by a coronavirus is one of the leading causes for
serious illnesses in people all over the world. According to the global statistics
of fatalities caused by coronavirus, and its spread in Iran, it is vital and essential
to forecast its outbreak by a model.
As the outbreak of coronavirus disease, 2019 (COVID-19), is a worldwide
pandemic, it is rapidly expanding in Iran, real-time analyses of epidemiological
data are needed to increase situational awareness and inform
interventions. Previously, real-time analyses have shed light on the
transmissibility, severity, and natural history of an emerging pathogen in the
first few weeks of an outbreak, such as with severe acute respiratory syndrome
(SARS), the 2009 influenza pandemic, and Ebola. Analyses of detailed line lists
of patients are particularly useful to infer key epidemiological parameters, such
as the incubation and infectious periods, and delays between infection and
detection, isolation, and reporting of cases. However, official individual patient
data rarely become publicly available, when the information is most needed.
This is an analysis of the COVID-19 out-break in Iran. In this population-level
observational study, I used the Iranian Ministry of Health reports downloaded
from GitHub, an online data-sharing platform. This dataset is updated on a daily
basis with a 24 hour delay. The dataset includes time-stamped counts of the
daily cases and deaths within each province in Iran.
In this study, we will build a predictive model based on the cumulative trend of
new cases and deaths for the top five provinces. I will also look at modeling the
trends for confirmed cases, deaths and recovered for the whole country.

Method
In this study, I have chosen to apply the exponential smoothing model to
iteratively forecast future values of a regular time seires from weighted averages
of past daily values of the series. This method is exponential because the value
of each level is influenced by every preceeding actual value to an exponentially
decreasing degree – more recent values are given a greater weight.

Due to the lack of historical data, seasonality analysis has been removed from
the modeling and the trends are analyzed based on the daily timeframe. The
available data is too small to identify seasonal patterns and make predictable
variation in value, such as annual fluctuation in temperature relative to the
season. The trend is a tendency in the data to increase or decrease over time.
The predictive model will be tested against four regression model evaluations
for robustness. They are as follow:
• MAE – mean absolute error, this gives less weight to the outliers
• MAPE – similar to MSE, but normalized by true observation. The
downside is when the true observation is zero, this metric could be
problematic.
• MSE – mean squared error, it is like a combination measurement of bias
ad variance of the prediction. For example, bias squared add variance.
• RMSE – root MSE, this takes the root of MSE to bring the unit back to
the actual value. It is the standard deviation of residuals (prediction
errors). Residuals are a measure of how far from the regression line data
points.

Both MAE & RMSE can range from 0 to infinity. They are negatively-oriented
scores: lower values are better.

The Akaike Information Criterion, AIC test will be applied to the predictive
model. The purpose of this test is to see how well the model fits the dataset
without over-fitting it. The AIC score rewards models that achieve a high
goodness-of-fit score ad penalizes them if they become over complex. A low
AIC score indicates a better fit.

Statistical analysis

Since the outbreak has begun in early February 2020, the rate of infection and
number of deaths has been increased significantly as seen in the illustration
below. On the 19th February, the first 2 deaths were reported, on the 23rd
February, 4 other provinces reported COVID-19 deaths, and within the space 28
days the virus has spreaded across the whole country (see illustration 2), by 20th
March 2020, Tehran, the capital city of Iran reported approximately to 4000
confirmed cases of COVID-19.

The total number of confirmed cases of infected patients on the 20th March 2020
is 19,661, with 1,411 deaths and 6,226 recovered. The top 10 most affected
provinces are Tehran, Esfahan, Mazandaran, Qom, Alborz, Gilan, Markazi,
Razavi-Khorasan, East Azerbaijan and Semon, which can be reviewed in
illustration 3, province ranked by confirmed cases from the highest number to
the least.

Based on the exponential smoothing model, the projection for the next 90 days
across the top 5 with the most reported confirmed cases are shown in illustration
4. If no control measures are put in place, it is expected that over 40,000 would
be infected in Tehran around the middle of June. However, if control measures
were implemented with a high degree of success, one would expect the spread
of the COV-19 virus would peak at the start of April with a downward trend
dropping off by the end of May (70 days). In the scenario, that no further
measures are implemented, one would expect the spread of COVID-19 to
continue on a gentle incline, reaching 21,000 by mid-June.

Two models have been tested with varying degrees of accuracy. The base model
shown in Illustration 5 is the simple forecast model, without trend or seasonality
built-in. It has the highest AIC out of the three models across the 5 sampled
provinces, although it has a low MAPE, when compared to the other three
statistical metrics like RMSE, MAE, MASE it yields the highest margin of error
in the group.

The quality of the predictive model for Tehran is acceptable because the dataset
is more robust compared to one integrated with seasonality. The Mean Absolute
Scaled Error, MASE is less than 1 for the projected 90 days period which is a
positive score for the model. The RMSE, unbiased forecast score is slightly
higher than the MAE, which gives a median future distribution of 84. The
MAPE is over 100% which means the errors are “much greater” then the actual
values.

The same process has been applied to review the confirmed, deaths and
recovered dataset. The forecast has been carried out for the next 30 days; a
shorter timeframe has been selected as there is a high probability that the
Iranian New Year’s celebration, Farvardin, first month of spring (30th March in
Western calendar) will have an impact on the infection rate following the event.

The best predictive model as seen in Illustration 7 predicts the confirmed cases
to be in the range of 35,000-70,000, with the number of reported COVDI-19
deaths to be between 3,000 – 5,000 and 5,000 – 30,000 of recovered cases.

The modeling outbreak of Covid-19 shows that the number of patients and
deaths is still increasing. Contagious diseases follow an exponential model and
the same be Haves this one. This is because, the virus can spread to others and
finally each person turns into a carrier of the virus and transmit it to another

the effectiveness of instructive traditions, environmental conditions, and so on.
This article strived to analyze the growth trend of the number of patients, deaths
and patients recovered in some provinces of Iran. The knowledge gained can
help health planners and planners. Combining the findings of this study with
other countries' studies can help to extract a global pattern for the virus outbreak
process analysis. We believe that there are still many factors that can be
included in the study. Adding these factors helps to validate and consolidate the
