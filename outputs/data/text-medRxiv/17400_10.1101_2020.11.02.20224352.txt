Abstract
In this study, we analyzed SARS-CoV-2 genomes in the Netherlands, in the context of global viral
population since the beginning of the pandemic. We have identified the most variant sites on the whole
genome as well as the stable, conserved ones on the S and N proteins. We found four mutations, S:D614G,
NSP12b:P314L, NSP3:F106F, to be the most frequent ones that dominate the SARS-CoV-2 population
outside of China. We detected novel variants of SARS-CoV-2 almost unique to the Netherlands that form
localized clusters, indicating community spread. We emphasize that while SARS-CoV-2 is evolving, and the
number of mutations from the reference sequence is increasing, we observe only little diversity in the
new variants as we enter the later stages of the pandemic. Our analyses suggest we have diverged away
from the current SARS-CoV-2 reference enough that the reference should be re-evaluated to represent
the current viral population more accurately. We assert our work provides valuable information on the
genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 and its local dynamics in the Netherlands, especially for DNA-based
diagnostic, therapeutic or vaccine development against COVID-19. We suggest sequence-based analyses
should opt for a consensus representation to adequately cover the genomic variation observed.

Background
In late December 2019, officials had reported the first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in
China, caused by a novel type of coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2,
(SARS-CoV-2) [1]. COVID-19 has consequently led to the global pandemic we are going through at the
moment; according a situation report released by the World Health Organization (September 9th) there
are 27.4 million cases and almost 900,000 deaths in total [2]. SARS-CoV-2 has been placed under the
betacoronavirus genus, closest relatives being bat and pangolin coronaviruses [3, 4].
Despite having major commonalities with recent outbreaks of betacoronaviruses, SARS in 2002 and
Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012, it is unprecedented not only in its ease of spread but
also in the collective effort of several international scientists to investigate and understand the biology of
the disease and the virus causing it since the day the first complete SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence had
been published [4–7]. Early studies on the SARS-CoV-2 genome has shown its closest relative, in terms of
sequence identity, to be the bat coronavirus RaTF13 with over 93.1% match in the spike (S) protein and
>96% sequence identity overall [8, 9]. Immediately a reference sequence had been established [10],

paving the way for the exponential growth in both the number and the scale of studies on the SARS-CoV2 genome [11–16].
At the moment, the GISAID database has established the SARS-CoV-2 population consists of six major
clades: G, GH, GR, L, S and V [17]. There is a growing number of studies on the genetic variability of SARSCoV-2 relative to the reference genome [18–21]. From previous viral outbreaks, it is known that as part
of the natural evolution of a virus, subpopulations of clades that can affect the severity of a disease
emerge and alter the trajectory of a pandemic [22]. It has been reported that while the two major
structural proteins, S and nucleocapsid (N) protein are rich in sites of episodic selection, ORF3a and ORF8
had also been shown to carry a lot of mutations [23].
In this study, we investigate the genetic variability of SARS-CoV-2 genomes in the Netherlands, in the
context of global viral population with a particular focus on the later stages of the first wave of the
pandemic (from early April to the end of May). We have identified the most variant proteins in the SARSCoV-2 genome, as well as the most frequent mutations in the Netherlands that also showed high
dominance in the rest of the world. We found relatively conserved regions in the S and N proteins of SARSCoV-2. Tracing the viral genome since its first introduction into the Netherlands, we detect novel
mutations unique to the Netherlands, which indicates local clusters of viral sub-populations are emerging.
Our work provides valuable insights into the SARS-CoV-2 population in the Netherlands that would prove
beneficial for tracking routes of transmission through genetic variation, future efforts in primer/probe
design in RT-qPCR tests, and development of potential vaccines against COVID-19.

Methods
Our study of SARS-COV-2 genomes in the Netherlands consists of three main steps: data retrieval,
preprocessing and multiple sequence alignment, phylogenetic tree construction and sequence variation
analysis. We have also analyzed the global phylogenetic tree of SARS-COV-2 genomes using additional
metadata on patients and travel history.

Data retrieval and preprocessing, and multiple sequence alignment
Complete, high quality (number of undetermined bases less than 1% of the whole sequence) genome
sequences of SARS-COV-2 that were isolated from human hosts only were obtained from GISAID, NCBI
and China’s National Genomics Data Center (NGDC) on June 13th [17, 24, 25]. The dataset contained
29503 sequences with unique identifiers in total, including the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference sequence
(accession ID NC_045512.2). The acknowledgement table for GISAID sequences can be found in
Supplementary File 2, and the full list of sequence identifiers for NCBI and NGDC records are provided in
Supplementary File 3.
All sequences were aligned against the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference using MAFFT (v7.46) with the FFT-NSfragment option, and the alignment was filtered to remove identical sequences to obtain 24365 nonredundant genomes [26].

Sequence variation analysis
In order to determine mutations, the filtered multiple sequence alignment was trimmed to remove gaps
from the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference (accession ID NC_045512.2) and used as input to the coronapp web
application to obtain nucleotide variations [27]. Next, the trimmed alignment was used to cluster genomes

according to the nomenclature on GISAID website. We assigned all 29503 sequences to one of the clades
S, L, V, G, GH and GR.

Phylogenetic tree construction
The maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree for the samples in the Netherlands was built using IQ-TREE
(v2.05) with GTR model, allowing to collapse non-zero branches, and ultrafast bootstrap with 1000
replicates [28]. A time tree was also constructed for dating branches in IQ-TREE (v2.05) and the final tree
was rooted at the ancestral node of S clades in the tree using ETE Toolkit (v3.1.1) [29]. ETE was also used
for visualizing tree.

Results
The global SARS-CoV-2 dataset was filtered considering only the sequence quality, hence we observe a
large discrepancy in the distribution of genomes across different countries. Initially, most sequencing
effort was concentrated in China and other countries where the outbreak had begun. However, at the
time of data retrieval (June 13th) the dataset is dominated by samples from the UK, the USA and Australia
(Table 1 and Figure 1).

Since we have not corrected for sampling differences, in this section, we will provide a view of the current
situation of pandemic mainly in Europe, focusing on the Netherlands, where most of the viral genomes

are available today (Figure 1). While initially many genome sequences were generated, by April virtually
no sequences were determined.

Figure 1. Distribution of SARS-CoV-2 genomes across five continents: total number of genomes is shown in subplot A and the
change in number of genomes over the course of pandemic in subplot B. See legend of B for colors of each continent.

Distinct genetic patterns in the SARS-CoV-2 population emerge across the globe
In order to get an overview of the viral diversity throughout the pandemic, we used the clade definitions
proposed by the GISAID database [17]. We observe the distribution of different clades in the Netherlands
resemble that of Australia where the first samples are genetically diverse and there is no dominating
variant (subplots in Figure 2). A similar pattern is seen in other European counties such as the UK and
Belgium, while the USA, Canada and Denmark have distinct trajectories with GH clade dominating the
population (Additional file 1, Figure S3). Also note that clade S has gradually faded out despite its high
prevalence before April in several countries, this is particularly noticeable in Australia, China (Figure 2),
the USA, Spain and Canada (Additional file 1, Figure S3).
Viral diversity can be observed more clearly when put into context with less diverse populations in other
countries where the outbreak had begun the earliest. For instance, China, Singapore and Italy had
experienced the outbreak the earliest in the world, and there are only few of the major clades circulating
(Figure 2, Italy not shown due to small sample size, see Figure S3 for other countries). China had opted for
possibly the most severe restrictions; similarly in Singapore, the initial cases of COVID-19 had been
followed up with strict precautions, preventing both the spread and new introduction of the virus. While
it is tricky to formulate any clear hypothesis since there has not been any submission from either country
since April, it is certainly interesting to see the contrast between them and countries where COVID-19
arrived at relatively late stages of the pandemic, such as the Netherlands, Australia and India. The
composition of viral genomes in these locations appears to be quite diverse, suggesting multiple
introductions of virus.

average over seven days was calculated for six clades (see the legend for clade names and colors) discarding intervals of less than
one genome per day.

Evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 genome and increased mutation frequency in hotspot regions
As the pandemic progresses, we observe that across time different mutations dominate the viral
population. It is essential to monitor these changes in the SARS-CoV-2 genome to identify conserved sites
relevant for designing therapeutics and vaccines, as well as to study the viral evolution during a pandemic.
Currently, each new sample has on average around 10 mutation sites in total compared to the WuhanHu-1 reference (accession ID NC_045512.2) in the Netherlands where the trajectory has been in parallel
with those in Europe and the world (Figure 3). Clearly showing a divergence away from the original
reference.

Figure 3. Number of mutations per sample over the course of pandemic in the Netherlands (green), Europe (orange) and globally
(blue): data points corresponding to dates with fewer than five samples are faded on color to indicate uncertainty.

In particular, the S and N proteins have both been reported as the most variant proteins in the SARS-CoV2 genome [23, 30]. S:D614G and N:RG203KR amino acid changes comprise a large fraction of the mutation
in these regions, (Figure 4); former being one of the mutation that defines G, GR and GH clades. Apart
from carrying the majority of mutations observed in the populations, both proteins play an important role
in RT-qPCR based diagnostic tests as well as vaccine and drug development [31]. The S protein has been
investigated in great detail for its significance in binding to the host cell and a potential target for COVID19 treatment and vaccine design [32–34].
Prevalence of S:D614G variant has steadily increased over the course of the pandemic: it is observed in all
the sequences sampled recently in the world (Additional file supplementary figure S4). The location of
origin of this variant is still unclear, and its implications for humans infected with COVID-19 remain
unknown; however, it appears to be very rare in China despite its ubiquity in rest of the world (discussed
further in the following section). Note that there have been no sequences released publicly from China
since April, making it more difficult to interpret (bottom subplot for China in Figure 2). Thus, it is also likely
to be the result of a founder effect commonly observed in viral populations, when the virus spreads very
rapidly once in introduced through only a few members of the whole population [35]. Moreover, a study
on 453 COVID-19 patients in Sheffield, UK failed to detect any significant link between the trajectory of
disease in humans and presence/absence of S:D614G mutation [36].
In order to determine the appropriate primers to use when diagnosing patients with RT-PCR tests or when
designing novel primer/probe sequences, variations in the nucleotide sequence should be considered
since it plays a crucial role in achieving accurate tests [10, 20]. In light of these, in Figure 4 we have
highlighted the predicted epitope regions from [37] and the locations of RT-qPCR primer and probe
sequences currently used in the Netherlands with mutations with red and blue rectangles, respectively.
Without being too specific, amino-acid positions from 60 to 80, 160 to 170, 340 to 360 and 400 to 420
appear to be relatively stable sites, free of any mutations and could potentially be utilized as primer
sequences. This finding is further supported by recent work that combined prior information on the SARSCoV S and N proteins, and their known epitopes to identify regions in the SARS-CoV-2 genome that could
potentially serve as epitopes for B-cells and T-cells [37]. The authors confirmed that the most abundant

mutations in these regions, S:D614G in particular, should be taken into account for vaccine design and
development of treatments. The N protein is also recommended as a screening assay by the WHO, and is
utilized in many countries including the Netherlands [38].

Figure 4. Total number of mutations in the S (top) and N proteins in samples from the Netherlands; predicted epitope regions
from [37] and the recommended primer/probe sequences for RT-PCR diagnostic assays are shown in red and blue rectangles,
respectively.

Population of SARS-CoV-2 is dominated by four mutations globally while emergence of locally
distinct variants indicates local outbreaks
In addition to S:D614G and N:RG203KR, several other mutations, NSP12b:P314L, NSP3:F106F and
5’UTR:241 in particular, appear to dominate the most frequent mutations in the world; Figure 5 shows
the 15 most dominant SNPs in some of the most-sampled countries in our dataset. Due to overrepresentation of few European countries, it is difficult to comment on the geographical dominance of
any mutations. However, four mutations, S:D614G, NSP12b:P314L, NSP3:F106F and 5’UTR:241 (blue bars
in Figure 5) are established within the global collection genomes, except for China where these mutations
have very low frequencies.
While we observe a diverse mutational landscape in Australia, India and Spain, Viral population in China
has remained relatively homogenous and with very few variants compared to the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference.
The most frequent mutation is ORF8:L84S, which defines the S clade that appears to be fading out even
though it had been circulating since the beginning of the pandemic along with the L clade. Recently, a
possible link between two mutations, ORF8:L84S and NSP4:S76S, has been suggested as they co-occur
several times outside of Europe; in China, the USA, Australia and Canada [42]. We also note a few regionspecific mutations: first one being ORF8:L84S, which is more frequent in the USA and China and, second
is NSP6:L37F which is frequent in in Australia and the USA.

Figure 5. Total frequency (number of mutations per sample) of the top 15 mutations in the most-sampled countries in our
dataset: blue bars are mutations shared across all these countries in the top 15, while the red bars are unique to that one
country in the top 15.

Considering the fluctuations in rate of sequencing, and over-representation of samples from the USA, the
UK and Europe in general, it is difficult to comment on the geographical spread. Nevertheless, when we
look into the frequency of the top four mutations, S:D614G, NSP12b:P314L, NSP3:F106F and 5’UTR:241
over the course of pandemic (Figure 6), we see a steady increase of their abundance in the viral
population, regardless of the date of introduction in each country.
A common pattern emerges in the frequency change of shared and rarer mutations: before the
introduction of lockdown the viral population is very diverse with unique mutations indicating local
clusters (areas highlighted in yellow in Figure 6: first two weeks of March in the Netherlands, Australia,
Canada and Spain, and end of March for the UK, the USA and India). In the absence of travel restrictions,
we observe unique and rare mutations increase in frequency (late April in Figure 6, highlighted in blue).
The UK and the USA have been among the latest to impose control measures, and we see rare mutations
peak several times from February till mid-March. As the pandemic progresses, the four most abundant
mutations shared across each country (blue lines in Figure 6) become well-established as part of the viral
genome, while lifting the lockdown leads to again an increase in rare mutations (areas highlighted in blue
in Figure 6) as they spread and form local clusters of variants. Abundance of small variants suggest
community-driven spread, which can be elaborated by monitoring such variants to detect super-spreading
events.

Introduction of COV-19 in the Netherlands and local clusters with high genomic diversity
Next, we examined the Dutch phylogenetic tree to better understand the dynamics of COVID-19 in the
Netherlands: from its introduction in the earliest samples to its further spread through localized infection
clusters. We have identified multiple points of introduction in different provinces via highly diverse
samples of virus. As the pandemic progresses, we see deeper branching in the tree with unique, localized
mutations as well as similar patterns of evolution emerge in separate locations. While the virus population
carries an increased number of mutations in general, these mutations are localized in their own clusters
with little genomic diversity.

We observe two separate sections on the radial tree in Figure 7 below, representing the diversity of
introduction to the Netherlands in terms of both the viral genome and location. First, at the top, starting
from around 12 o’clock to 3 o’clock consists of some of the earliest samples from early March of V, L and
S clades (denoted with a blue arch and text “Early March”). This is further broken down into four sections
numbered from 1 to 4 where the second section is the early outbreak in Noord-Brabant in parallel with
the first case reports. However, the remaining sections are mixed in location and date as we encounter
samples isolated from Limburg, Zuid-Holland, Gelderland and Utrecht, also from later into the pandemic
in late March and early April.

Figure 7. Radial representation of the Dutch phylogenetic tree: inner circle colored w.r.t. the assigned clades (see legend for clade
names), outer circle is color-coded according to the sample collection date (if available), where the darker shade of blue
represents more recent samples. Major points discussed in the text have been indicated with blue arches on the outer circle,
along with more detailed information (numbered in clockwise direction) in gray arches on the inner circle.

The second point of introduction is from 4 o’clock to 6 o’clock on the tree, denoted as “late February and
early March” with a blue arch. This section differs from the first one in that we observe only samples of G
and GR clades, both of which are dominant in the Europe while absent in China. The earliest SARS-CoV-2
genome in our dataset with full sample collection date (accession ID EPI_IS_454750, collected on February
27) is also located in this section and it was first isolated in Utrecht.

Recall the clade distribution over time in the Netherlands (Figures 2 and 3) showed an initial phase of high
diversity with L and GR dominating the dataset, also supported by the phylogenetic analysis. As part of
the Dutch initiative to investigate transmission of COVID-19 in the Netherlands, Munnink et al. had
conducted a detailed analysis on the earlier samples with patient data [11]. More recently, Sikkema et al.
have published their findings on COVID-19 infection in health-care workers in early March [43]. Their
studies suggest multiple introductions from Italy and Switzerland, as well as localized community
transmissions in super-spreading events in late February and early March. In addition, the authors note
the diversity of early strains even for patients with similar travel histories, also in parallel with our
observations in our study. In addition to Noord-Brabant, Munnink et al. had detected local clusters in ZuidHolland and Utrecht.

Novel mutations appear in the later phase of pandemic
Munnink et al. have stated three phases of response to pandemic in the Netherlands in their study; (i)
before the first case was reported, (ii) from the first reported case to the start of screening of healthcare
workers and (iii) the period from the introduction of stricter measures along with events and large
gatherings of people being banned until March 15th when the most strict phase of lockdown had begun
as retail and catering industries were closed, as well as schools and childcare centers [44]. Since March
15th, the spread of COVID-19 has been very limited due to more stringent measures on travel and widely
adopted practice of social distancing. For this reason, it is particularly interesting to investigate the deeper
branching in Figure 7 with later samples around 8-9 o’clock (denoted with a blue arch and the text “May”).
Below in Figure 8, we have zoomed into the two “May” regions from Figure 7 (numbered 3 and 4 in Figure
8) as well as the remaining deep branches (numbered 1 and 2 in Figure 8). To simplify, we have indicated
the absence/presence of a mutation with a circle where the branch ends. Additional information about
sample collection date and its location are also displayed aligned to the leaves, if available and in the case
of duplicate sequences separated with a semicolon. Dates are expressed in format month-day. The large
squares next to the leaf names are color-coded clade assignments, colors have been kept consistent
throughout our study in Figures 2, 7 and 8.
We have identified four mutations all of which have emerged after March 15th and have led to deeper
branching on the phylogenetic tree and are either unique to the Netherlands or very rarely observed in
the rest of the world: N:P383P, NSP14:D390D, NSP14:S374A and ORF7a:F87F. These rare mutations could
be further utilized to track local transmissions of disease within the Netherlands.
N:P383P (green circles), a silent mutation on N protein is fairly unique to the Netherlands; it is present in
less than five sequences in many European countries, including the most well-sampled ones Denmark and
the UK, as well as the USA and Canada. Considering the sample size, it is surely intriguing that this mutation
has been observed only in the Netherlands in such abundance. This mutation is also one of the oldest
circulating ones since its first occurrence was in a sequence from the Switzerland on February 27 th.
However, we observe it for the first time in the Netherlands two weeks later on March 16 th (province
unknown). Later on, the same mutation has appeared in multiple provinces, Noord Holland, Zuid Holland,
Flevoland, Utrecht and Limburg, in 50 sequences in total. Moreover, we observe it in two separate
branching events in the phylogenetic tree in different provinces of the Netherlands; several provinces in
arc number 1 and only in Limburg in arc number 3. In a recent study, this mutation had been detected as
one of several homoplasies on the SARS-CoV-2 genome [45]. Since the Limburg branching contains only
three sequences carrying the mutation, it is difficult to comment whether it is convergent or not. Given

that branching with number 1 contains several provinces; it is also likely that this is a consequence of
relaxations in domestic travel restrictions, rather than convergent evolution.
The second mutation, NSP14:D390D (purple circles), is tricky to interpret because it is present in only 9
genomes, 7 of which had been sequenced in the Netherlands and the remaining two in the UK. It has first
appeared in the UK on March 24th, during strict lockdown conditions, and it has emerged in the
Netherlands in May. We hypothesize this is a small cluster of variants genomes, localized in Limburg only
and it has not found the chance to spread outside of the province yet.
NSP14:S374A (blue circles) is the only non-silent mutation in this list, and is very unique to Zuid Holland;
it is present in 35 genomes in total, all collected in Zuid-Holland region within three weeks. Similar to
NSP14:D390D, it is highly likely to be a small, contained cluster of individuals.
ORF7a:F87F (pink circles) is also incredibly rare since it was observed only in Gelderland in the Netherlands
from late April to early May, and less than five times in any other country. It occurs in only one sequence
from Canada in April 13th, twice in the USA in late March and four times in the UK in mid-April.

Discussion
In this work, we retrieved 29,503 complete, high quality SARS-CoV-2 from publicly available databases to
explore the viral population diversity In the Netherlands, within a global context. Considering the rapid
increase in public data and research on this subject, our work is among the more comprehensive ones to
lend insight into the genetic variation of SARS-CoV-2 in the later stages of the pandemic in April and early
May.
As a consequence of the natural evolution of a virus, SARS-CoV-2 genome has been diverging from the
initial reference sequence Wuhan-Hu-1 established based on viral samples from Wuhan, China. The six
major clades designated by GISAID had varying distributions in different regions, at different points of
time through the course of pandemic. We demonstrated that in most countries, viral population goes
through an initial phase of high diversity followed by a decline in genetic variety in which the population
is comprised of mostly G, GR or GH clades (Figure 2). With increased ease of travel, COVID-19 was able to
spread rapidly across the world and several studies had reported multiple introductions of a diverse viral
population into many countries outside of China that lends itself to a more homogeneous population
diverged from the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference [11, 16, 46, 47]. Interesting, we have also observed that China
and Singapore, both of which are countries that experienced the outbreak the earliest, harbor a markedly
different viral population that remains mostly homogeneous with L being the dominant clade that also
includes the Wuehan-Hu-1 reference (Figure 2). Note that this could also be the artifact of the dramatic
decline in number of sequences from China.
The S and N proteins in SARS-CoV-2 genome has received much attention; both have been reported as
the most variant proteins [23, 30] and are also significant in RT-qPCR based diagnostic tests as well as
vaccine and drug development [31]. We have identified the most variant sites on the S and N proteins in
sequences from the Netherlands (Figure 4). Koyama et al. had noted the effect of these variants on
sequence-based vaccine and therapeutics against COVID-19 [37]. Following their discussion, we highlight
their predicted epitope regions derived from SARS and the mutations we detected on the S and N proteins
in Figure 4. In addition, Kim et al. discussed variations on SARS-CoV-2 genes targeted by diagnostic assays
in [21]. Similarly, we analyzed primer/probe sequences currently in use in the Netherlands for diagnostics
targeting S and N genes (Figure 4); while the specific implications of mutations on the accuracy of
diagnostic tests is unknown, we reported the amino acid positions on N gene from 60 to 80, 160 to 170,
340 to 360 and 400 to 420 to be relatively stable, hence suitable for primer design in RT-qPCR tests.
When we observed the global landscape of variants, we found four mutations, S:D614G, N:RG203KR,
NSP3:F106F and 5’UTR:241, are not only the most frequent ones, but also have been steadily increasing
in the frequency outside of China since the beginning of pandemic. The implications of these mutations
thriving in the population individually are currently unknown, speculative at best. However, some studies
have suggested certain linked mutations which poses a different question on its own [36]. We also
reported the increase in frequency of these shared mutations, regardless of the date of introduction
(Figure 6). On one hand, the abundance of these mutations might suggest that viral genome has
converged to a new variant, different than the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference. On the other hand, since most of
the viral sequences are from diagnostic tests performed on hospitalized patients at the moment, we are
looking at only a small portion of the whole virus population in humans and we do not know clearly
whether milder, or even asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 also carry these mutations or not. To our
knowledge, studies have not found any significant correlation between these specific mutations and the

COVID-19 disease in patients [36]. Nevertheless, it is surely interesting consider that these four mutations,
linked to one another, might also influence the infection in the human host.
We have analyzed the most frequent mutations around the world, and found that. Since the rate of
sequencing has been fluctuating dramatically and the dataset has been over-represented by the UK, the
USA and Europe in general, it is not possible to tell if any change in frequency of mutations over time is
caused by the unbalanced sampling or evolutionary advantage/disadvantage.
With our phylogenetic study in the Netherlands, we confirmed multiple introductions in distinct provinces
as well as the population diversity in the initial samples (Figure 7). We also detected emerging local
clusters, defined by four mutations, N:P383P, NSP14:D390D, NSP14:S374A and ORF7a:F87F, all of which
are either entirely unique to the Netherlands or very rarely observed elsewhere (Figure 8). N:P383P had
occurred at two distinct sections in different regions, we presume this is likely a domestic travel event
rather than a convergent mutation. We note the detection and monitoring of such unique mutations could
be utilized for tracking the spread of virus and identifying possible routes of transmission during the
outbreak. In addition, our findings are in line with previous studies in the Netherlands by Munnink et al
and Sikkema et al.; they had also observed sequence diversity in the earliest days of the outbreak as well
as community transmission [11, 43].
The single most prominent pattern that we encountered in our study was that despite the continual
increase in number of mutations in the genome, diverging away from the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference, there
is little diversity in the new variants as we enter the later stages of the pandemic. This suggests the current
SARS-CoV-2 reference genome should be re-evaluated, perhaps replaced with a new one that represents
the viral population more accurately. Further work is required to investigate implications of an inadequate
reference in sequence-based analyses as well as develop alternative models. Having a good quality
reference sequence is crucial in sequence-based analyses, and we assert this line of research will continue
to supplement the global effort to fight COVID-19.
The major limitation of our study is the biased dataset of SARS-CoV-2 sequences. Despite our efforts to
combine all genome sequences publicly available up to date, due to imbalanced sampling and dramatic
changes in the frequency of genome sequencing, our dataset is over-represented by samples from the
Europe and the USA and there are several gaps in time since the beginning of pandemic. In addition, most
of the viral sequencing today is performed on hospitalized patients. These issues could be circumvented
to some extend by stratified sampling or controlled sequencing efforts with random samples collected
from individuals. Nevertheless, our findings are significant to understand the viral population diversity
within the Netherlands from late March to early May, where our dataset has the most coverage.

Conclusions
In this study, we have analyzed 29503 SARS-CoV-2 genomes retrieved from public databases to investigate
genetic diversity in viral population as the pandemic progresses, with a focus on the Netherlands, in
particular. Our dataset contained 1338 genomes from the Netherlands, most of them sequenced in the
later stages of pandemic in April and early May. We assert our work provides valuable information on the

genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 and its local dynamics in the Netherlands for tracking the transmission of
COVID-19, as well as DNA-based therapeutic or vaccine development against COVID-19, and primer/probe
design in RT-qPCR tests. We emphasize the little diversity observed globally in recent samples despite the
increased number of mutations relative to the established reference sequence, suggesting the current
reference may not be representative of the population; potential implications of an inadequate reference
on downstream analyses should be investigated.
