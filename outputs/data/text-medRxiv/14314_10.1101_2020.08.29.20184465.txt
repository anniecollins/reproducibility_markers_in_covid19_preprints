Abstract.

The present work concerns the COVID-19's spread over The United
States, Brazil and Colombia. Although countries show dierences in economic
development, but similarities such as continental dimension or social interaction, the
spread of COVID-19 in them has some similarities. At the moment, the countries
are living the disease with temporal delay. Thus, we used a database on WHO
Coronavirus, Mathematical Modeling and Numerical Simulations to describe the
most recent COVID-19 development patterns in these countries, which we saw.
Keywords. Mathematical Modeling, Numerical Analysis, COVID-19.
1. Introduction
The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus pandemic causes the COVID-19 disease, for which
we have no immune response or vaccine.

The origin of COVID-19 is believed to

have occurred in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. From China, the disease was rapidly
transmitted globally by individuals who travelled to Europe and The United States.
On the America continent, the rst cases of COVID-19 appeared in The United
States. On January 21, 2020, the American Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) conrmed the rst case of COVID-19 in a 35-year-old man from

Snohomish County, Washington, who returned from a trip to the region around
Wuhan [1]. In February 2020, cases of COVID-19 were already emerging in several
countries on the American continent. The coronavirus landed in Latin America on
February 26, when Brazil conrmed a case in São Paulo, a 61-year-old man who
returned from a trip to Italy [2]. The Colombia's rst case of COVID-19 took place
on March 6, 2020, a 19-year-old female who traveled to Milan, Italy [3]. Currently,
COVID-19 has reached almost all countries on the American continent.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), on July 31, 2020, The
United States, Brazil and Colombia were the countries of the American continent
with the highest numbers of daily infected cases [4]. By this date, 9.152.173 cases
and 351.121 deaths by COVID-19 had already occurred in the American continent,
comprising over 53.5% of the total number of reported cases in the world.

The

United States, Brazil and Colombia present 4.388.566, 2.552.265 and 276.055 cases
with 150.054, 90.134 and 9.454 deaths, respectively, comprising over 48%, 28% and
3% of the total number of reported cases in the American continent [4].
The United States, Brazil and Colombia are in dierent moments in the epidemiological process, Colombia is in the exponential growth phase, Brazil is probably
in the peak of the epidemic, while The United States is already experiencing a
second wave of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection.

It is noteworthy that these

three countries have very dierent Human Development Indexes (HDI) and territorial dimensions and, even so, they have in common high infection rates by the
SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.
The objective of this article is to carry out a mathematical study of the possible
trends of the epidemic by COVID-19 in these three countries. This article was based
on the data provided by the WHO [4] and the Susceptibles-Infectious-RecoveredDead model, the SIRD model [5][6].
The SIRD model is a classic compartmental model of the Kermack - McKendrick type [7][8]. Compartmental models divide the population into several different compartments, for example, Susceptible population, Infectious population,
Recovered population, Dead population, among others, and specify how individuals
move through the compartments over time. Despite being a simple mathematical
model, the SIRD is one of the most applied mathematical models to understand the
current health crisis. Obviously, more realistic and complex models would better
describe the dynamics of this epidemic, but data and information about COVID-19
are lacking to implement them. Reviews of epidemiological models can be found in
[5][6].
Regarding the adjustment of the parameters of the SIRD model for The United
States, Brazil and Colombia, it appears that these parameters change frequently,
depending on local political factors (closure of non-essential establishments, quarantine, movement restrictions...)

[9], socio-economic factors (social and hygienic

behaviors, lower per-capita income...) [10][11], climatic factors (temperature, humidity, average wind speed, UV index...)

[12], among others.

In this context, it

was decided to adjust the parameters of the SIRD model over time, based on data
made available by WHO, using non-linear least squares methods [13][14].
Regarding the numerical procedures to solve the SIRD model, rst, the dis-

cretization of the ordinary dierential equation system was performed using the
Finite Dierence Method. The resulting linear system of non-linear equations was
solved iteratively by the Gauss-Seidel method until the convergence criterion was
overcome.

It was also found that all the matrices's coecients of the iterative

processes satisfy the Sassenfeld convergence criterion [15][16][17].

2. Materials and Methods

2.1. Data Base
There are several data base source about COVID-19, e.

g., Brazil's Coronavirus

Panel [18], the National Institute of Health in Colombia [19], the Johns Hopkins
Coronavirus Resource Center [20] and among other sources that exhibit the numbers
of the infected, dead and more information as well.
But, to this work we used the WHO Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Dashboard [4] to keep integrity and uniformity of our numerical model.
From source WHO Coronavirus Dashboard we did not have the recovering data
over time, so we used the assumption that says - the time for a person to be moved
from the infected to the recovered compartmental can be about 14 days [21] [22].
Thus, we reconstructed the number of people in the compartments: Susceptible,
Infected, Recovered and Dead.
In fact the coronavirus disease is not completely understanding at the moment,
certainly there are additional parameters unknown that describing better the pattern it.

So, we chose to take several data sets consolidated of the 14 days to do

our simulations in order to get more realistic information.

In this way, we got a

simulations' clustering which permitted to understanding the fundamentals of the
behavior coronavirus disease over the countries.
How already mentioned in the introduction section, the disease begins at The
United States, Brazil and Colombia countries in a dierent times.

The govern-

ment actions (good or bad), civil liberties, and mass testing come interfering with
the situation of COVID-19 in countries. All of these conducts imply at the number variations of the infected and dead people, what is transcribed at the WHO
Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) data base.
From data base, it can be seen that The United States is living a second wave
contamination. Brazil, maybe, arrived at the infecting peak on the August month.
Colombia, clearly, is going up at the infected number yet. So, we have a time delay
of the COVID-19's spread in the countries. With these, we want to explain how
disease spreading happens in the countries through numerical simulations. But with
a cluster of simulations, not just a simulation alone.

the governing equations system (2.4) is solved by a convergent methodology
to any time;

•

our implicit methodology does not need a severe restriction on the

value.

The implicit method together with Gauss-Seidel and Lax's law guarantee it. Besides, the tF time is discovered in the computational run's time. To performance all
simulation we developed a fortran 90 code that solve the SIRD's governing equations
from auxiliary conditions.

The parameters' optimization in the SIRD (2.1) is done as in [24, 25], that is,
We dene the vector function u(t) =

In this section we introduce our analyse of the COVID-19 and simulations as well.
The reader will see here that the country's richness, its continental dimension or
social interaction are not avoid the Sars-CoV-2 infection.
By other hand, it is good to explain we used normalized measures, what allow us
to compare the disease spread at the countries. We setting

population values like

328.200.000, 211.000.000, 49.650.000 to The United States (USA), Brazil (BRA)
and Colombia (COL), respectively. Thus the SIRD's model variables kept at the

[0, 1]

window. Also, the times counting begins in

t=0

which corresponds to 2020-

01-20 (USA), 2020-02-26 (BRA) and 2020-03-06 (COL). We remember that our
simulations were done with data taken every 14 days to each country. What it led
to label the simulations like

S1 , . . . , S6 .

The Figures (3)-(4) show the data for susceptible, infected, recovered and dead
in the time.

We preferred to display them this shape to see the COVID-19 rises

at the countries.

For latin countries, the infected number came going up, but it

looks like the Brazil already reached the peak. The american population is living
a second wave and walks to second peak, probably. Additionally, the recover and
dead people increase. But with a recover number much higher than the death.

Floyd's assassinate (2020-05-25) at the Minneapolis-US. Maybe, the inection point
could be correlated to not social distancing of the USA people manifestation about

Beyond of that, The United States have indicated a value climb at the recover

is higher than the death number, see the Figure (7).

so far. Colombia, whose simulations started in the date 2020-05-14, presents the
same patter of Brazil's susceptible, see the Figure (9).

However, the Colombia's

Covid-19 disease is more accelerated than Brazil, it's further evident in the last
days, see the Figure (8 - left) and Figure (9 - right).

Colombia do not rich the disease peak, yet.

This can be seen through of the

Figure (10). The COVID-19's spread come increasing and its peak is still far away.
Nevertheless, to Brazil it is possible to infer the disease peak and plateau happen
between August and September in the present year, see the Figure (11). We assume
it because at the months May and June the COVID-19 became decelerating.

Analogous to The United States, the recovered and death Brazilians numbers
climbs at the values, Figure (12) but with dierent magnitudes between them as
well. This patter happens to Colombia as well, look the Figure (13).

Finally, we emphasize that the COVID-19's dynamic of the Brazil and Colombia
are the same, but as delay. Of course the next days are crucials, the countries cannot
relax your ght actions against COVID-19. The our simulations predict that there
are some control over COVID-19 disease in theses countries, yet.

Clearly, we do

not know the specic proceedings which provide it. But if they relax, the countries
could have a second wave infection similar to the one the United States is currently
experiencing.

Resumo.

O presente trabalho trata do espalhamento da COVID-19 sobre os Estados Unidos, Brasil e Colômbia. Embora os países exibam diferenças no desenvolvimento econômico, mas similaridades tais como dimensão continental ou interação
social, a propagação do COVID-19 neles tem algumas semelhanças. Agora, os países
estão vivendo a doença com atraso temporal. Assim, usamos um banco de dados
de Coronavirus da OMS, Modelagem Matemática e Simulações Numéricas para descrever o padrão mais recente de desenvolvimento do COVID-19 nesses países, que
nós observamos.
Palavras-chave. Modelagem Matemática, Simulações Numéricas, COVID-19.
