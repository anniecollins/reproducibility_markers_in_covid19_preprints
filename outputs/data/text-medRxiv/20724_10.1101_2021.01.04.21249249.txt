Abstract
The present study examines the impact of environment pollution indicators and weather
indicators on the COVID-19 outbreak in the capital city of India. In this study, we
hypothesize that certain weather conditions with an atmosphere having high content of air
pollutants, might impact the transmission of COVID-19, in addition to the direct human to
human diffusion. The Kendall and Spearman rank correlation tests were chosen as an
empirical methodology to conduct the statistical analysis. In this regard, we compiled a daily
dataset of COVID-19 cases (Confirmed, Recovered, Deceased), Weather indicators
(Temperature and relative humidity) and pollution indicators (PM 2.5, PM 10, NO2, CO, and
SO2) in Delhi state of India. The effects of each parameter within three time frames of same
day, 7 days ago, and 14 days ago are evaluated. This study reveal a significant correlation
between the transmission of COVID-19 outbreaks and the atmospheric pollutants with a
combination of specific climatic conditions. The findings of this research will help the
policymakers to identify risky geographic areas and enforce timely preventive measures.

1. Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease which initially detected in
Wuhan, China, has now spread all over the world, and if not well dealt, it could even lead to
the worldwide economic crisis. This virus exhibits high human-to-human transmissibility that
is the reason it has spread all across the world in a very short span of time. The World Health
Organization (WHO) reported 4,789,205 COVID-19 confirmed cases and 318,789 deaths

worldwide until May 20, 2020 [1]. The deadly virus has affected more than 210 countries had
been affected where United States (US) alone contributed approximately one-fourth of the
total cases. Other major countries having a significant impact are Russia, Spain, Italy, Iran,
France, Germany, UK, Turkey, China, and many more. The situation in India has started
worsening day by day. The first COVID-19 case in India was reported on January 30, 2020
and as on May 20, 2020 India has 106,750 COVID-19 confirmed cases, including 3303
deaths [1]. As per WHO, India has not entered into the state of the community transmission,
still it has clusters of cases.
India had enforced mandatory nationwide lockdown and enforced stricter rules to combat the
COVID-19 pandemic since March 25, 2020 and further extended it till May 31, 2020. The
lockdown might have helped in combating the transmission rate of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Figure 1 shows the overall picture of confirmed cases of COVID-19 across the states of India.

Many geographical, social, political, and environmental factors might influence the impact of
this deadly virus. Delhi is one of the most affected states in the India, currently has fourth
highest infected number of patients. As of May 20, 2020, Ministry of Health and Family
Welfare, Government of India has confirmed more than 10,500 cases, including>166 deaths
in Delhi state. Delhi has experienced a drastic reduction in air pollution up to 50% [2] due to
the implementation of extended mandatory lockdown to prevent COVID-19 transmission.
Since, Delhi is considered among the most polluted cities of the world [3], it is worth
analysing the role of environment pollution indicators on COVID-19 outbreak.
The link between exposure to air pollutants such as PM2.5 and PM10, Sulfur dioxide,
nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide and ozone and increased risk for respiratory virus
infections as well as susceptibility to respiratory virus infections is well established [4] [5].
There is significant evidence that air pollution is associated with influenza [6], pneumonia
and acute lower respiratory infections [7], and severe acute respiratory syndrome [8].
Although much more about COVID-19 remains to be learned, some studies have tried to
examine the air quality and impact of environmental pollutants' association with COVID-19.
Table 1 summarizes the findings of these studies conducted in various countries worldwide.

Earlier studies have also suggested that the meteorological parameters might be active factors
in the transmission of viruses and disease emergence. Yuan et al. investigated that the peak
spread of SARS occurred in a particular range of Temperature, Relative Humidity, and Wind
Velocity [18]. Variations of absolute Humidity correlate with the onset and seasonal cycle of
influenza viral in the US. [19]. Recently, various studies have been conducted to analyze the
impact of weather conditions on the spread and effect of COVID-19. We have summarized
the outcome of these studies conducted worldwide in the Table2.

The independent effect of air pollution as well as weather indicators on the transmission of
COVID-19 has not been studied systemically in the Indian context. Therefore, it is reasonable
to speculate that environmental and meteorological factors might affect the spread of
COVID-19 in India as well. In this paper, we attempt to answer a very important research
question that need prompt responses: “Is there a potential association between the
transmission of the coronavirus and the levels of air pollutants as well as weather indicators?”
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the effects of air quality and
weather conditions on COVID-19 outbreak in India.
The primary weather indicators i.e. temperature (°C), and Humidity (%) and pollution
indicators such as PM 10, PM 2.5, Sulfur dioxide (SO2), Carbon monoxide (CO), and
Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) was considered as independent variables for finding the correlation
with affected cases of COVID-19. The majority of the related recent studies have considered
the indicators of the same day, which could present a false picture in terms of the correlation
with COVID-19 cases. Since the incubation period of the COVID-19 virus varies from 1 day
to 14 days, we have evaluated the impact of pollution and weather indicators for three time
frames, namely on the day, 7 days ago, and 14 days ago.

2.3 Statistical analysis
As the data collected are not normally distributed; therefore Kendall [30] and Spearman rank
correlation [31] tests are considered in this study to investigate the association of pollution
and weather indicators with COVID-19 cases. Both of these methods are accepted measures
of non-parametric rank correlations. We hypothesize that certain weather conditions with an
atmosphere having high content of air pollutants, might favour the transmission of COVID19, in addition to the direct human to human diffusion. A null hypothesis corresponding to
each indicator is formulated that there is no association between individual indicators and the
three case statistics considered in this study.

The significant findings of this study show that pollution and weather indicators are
significantly correlated with COVID-19 daily confirmed, recovered and deaths in Delhi.
Table 3 depicts the empirical estimations of environmental pollutants' correlation with
COVID-19. The study highlights that the concentration of Particulate Matter indicators PM10
and PM2.5 in two time frames i.e. same day and 7 days ago have a positive correlation with
deaths caused by COVID-19. These findings are in line with the study conducted by Yao et
al. [15] in China. PM10 and PM 2.5, 7 days ago are also significant for daily confirmed cases
and the recovered cases. The impact of CO and NO2 same day and 7 days ago on daily
recovered cases can be easily observed. SO2 values same day and 14 days ago has also
shown impact on daily recovered cases and the correlation is negative similar to the findings
of Zhu et al. [11] for China. Overall, the pollution indicators 14 days ago have negligible
influence on the COVID-19 outbreak. Similarly, all the pollution indicators on same do not
have any significant relation with daily confirmed cases. The results also indicate that the
most reasonable timespan to study the impact of pollution indicators is 7 days ago.

Table 4 highlights the Kendall and Spearman’s correlation coefficients corresponding to 4
weather indicators evaluated at three time frames i.e. same day, 7 days ago and 14 days ago
among the daily confirmed, recovered, and deceased cases. The average and maximum
temperature at all the three time frames possess strong positive correlation with both daily
confirmed and the recovered cases as posited by [32]. The temperatures same day are also
significant for the daily deceased cases. The study also highlights the association of average
and maximum humidity at two time frames (same day and 7 days ago) with daily deceased
cases. The correlation is negative, which implies that as the humidity increases, the daily
mortality lowers. The average and maximum humidity at 7 days is also significant for daily
recovered cases. By and large, the maximum relative Humidity on the same day doesn’t
exhibit a significant association with the COVID-19 daily confirmed cases in the duration of
this study, which contradicts the study in Iran [28] . Both the Spearman as well as Kendall
correlation coefficients supports the above findings however, the magnitude of correlation
coefficients are higher in the Spearman correlation test.

This study reveal a significant correlation between the transmission of COVID-19 outbreaks
and the atmospheric pollutants with a combination of specific climatic conditions. This study
has shown evidence of pollution and weather indicators correlation with COVID-19 cases;
however, there are various limitations under which this study has been conducted. The
variables such as lockdown measures, people’s individual immunity, migration index, and
other climate indicators can impact the results presented in this study.
4. Conclusions
The environment pollution as well as weather indicators can play a crucial role in the fight
against coronavirus. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the
impact of environment pollution and weather indicators on COVID-19 incidences in Indian
context. Unlike other studies, the present study investigates the impact of these indicators in
three time frames of same day, 7 days ago and 14 days ago. We have analysed that the
pollution indicators are significantly correlated with COVID-19 cases, hence limited human
exposure to outdoor pollution may lead to decline in COVID-19 cases. The present study can
be further enhanced by including other parameters such as demographic variations, healthcare
infrastructure, and social policies like lockdowns to provide better insight into the fight
against COVID-19.
