ABSTRACT:

Importance: Currently, there is no unified framework linking disease progression to established
viral levels, clinical tests, inflammatory markers, and investigational treatment options.

Objective: It may take many weeks or months to establish a standard treatment approach.
Given the growing morbidity and mortality with respect to COVID-19, we present a treatment
approach based on a thorough review of scholarly articles and clinical reports. Our focus is on
staged progression, clinical algorithms, and individualized treatment.

Evidence Review: We followed the protocol for a quality review article proposed by Heyn et.
al.1 A literature search was conducted to find all relevant studies related to COVID-19. The
search was conducted between April 1, 2020 and April 13, 2020 using the following electronic
databases: PubMed (1809 to present), Google Scholar (1900 to present), MEDLINE (1946 to
present), CINAHL (1937 to present), and Embase (1980 to present). Keywords used included
COVID-19, 2019-nCov, SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV, with terms such as efficacy,
seroconversion, microbiology, pathophysiology, viral levels, inflammation, survivability, and
treatment and pharmacology. No language restriction was placed on the search. Reference lists
were manually scanned for additional studies.

Findings: Of the articles found in the literature search, 70 were selected for inclusion in this
study (67 cited in the body of the manuscript and 3 additional unique references in the Figures).

The articles represent work from China, Japan, Taiwan, Vietnam, Rwanda, Israel, France, the
United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Canada, and the United States. Most of the articles were
cohort or case studies, but we also drew upon information found in guidelines from hospitals
and clinics instructing their staff on procedures to follow. In addition, we based some decisions
on data collected by agencies such as the CDC, FDA, IHME, ISDA, and Worldometer. None of the
case studies or cohort studies used a large number of participants. The largest group of
participants numbered less than 500 and some case studies had fewer than 30 patients.
However, the review of the literature revealed the need for individualized treatment protocols
due to the variability of patient clinical presentation and survivability. A number of factors
appear to influence mortality: the stage at which the patient first presented for care, preexisting health conditions, age, and the viral load the patient carried.

Conclusion and Relevance: COVID-19 can be divided into three distinct Stages, beginning at the
time of infection (Stage I), sometimes progressing to pulmonary involvement (Stage II, with or
without hypoxemia) and less frequently to systemic inflammation (Stage III). In addition to
modeling the stages of disease progression, we have also created a treatment algorithm which
considers age, comorbidities, clinical presentation, and disease progression to suggest drug
classes or treatment modalities. This paper presents the first evidence-based recommendations
for individualized treatment for COVID-19.

Introduction
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is raging throughout the globe. In
the United States alone, as of April 10, 2020, there were 560,933 cases along with 22,127
deaths (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC).2 A mathematical model created by
The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) predicts that in the United States,
assuming continued full social distancing, the number of new cases will peak in late April, and
related deaths will peak by mid-to-late May.3 This creates a critical and immediate need for
medical treatment and resources.
Preliminary data in the US suggests that COVID-19 may be more infectious and lethal
than Influenza H1N1. In the general population, current case-fatality rates for COVID-19 are
about 3.9%, and infection rates are about 2.5 under normal conditions.4 To place this in
context, Figure 1 provides a comparison of the reproduction rate and case-fatality rates for
major respiratory virus pandemics.5-7 Data strongly emphasizes early intervention to reduce
case-fatality and inhibit reproductive rates.
A number of articles have been published on the clinical course and treatment of the
disease.8-10 The majority of patients present with more than one symptom on admission,
although the combination of fever, cough, and shortness of breath is rare. Siddiqi and Mehra
proposed a staged progression model based on observed clinical courses in published studies.11
In Stage 1, or the mild phase, the virus multiplies and establishes residence in the host,
predominantly in the respiratory tract. In Stage 2, we see that viral multiplication and localized
inflammation in the lungs is common. Stage 3 is marked by extra-pulmonary systemic
hyperinflammation syndrome. The prognosis and recovery from Stage 3 is generally poor. Rapid

recognition of what stage the patient is in and deployment of appropriate therapy may have
the greatest yield.
Common correlates with poorer outcomes include age, hypertension, diabetes,
coronary artery disease, chronic lung disease, and malignancies.12 Research also finds variations
in outcomes due to a dysregulated and exuberant immune response. Patients requiring
intensive care have significantly higher levels of IL-6, CRP, ferritin, and D-Dimer. An important
therapeutic modality may be to downregulate the cytokine storm, particularly in severe
illness.13 The literature also suggest that disease progression can be predicted. During the
severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic, a retrospective analysis revealed that 2week cumulative case data could help estimate the total case numbers with accuracy – well
before the date of the last reported case.14
As we have found, there is no unified framework linking disease progression to
established viral levels, clinical tests, inflammatory markers, and investigational treatment
options. Given that it may take many weeks or months to establish a standard treatment
approach and there is a growing morbidity and mortality, we present an initial treatment
approach based on a thorough review of currently available scholarly articles and clinical
reports. Our focus is on staged progression, clinical algorithms, and individualized treatment.

Methods
We followed the protocol for a quality review article proposed by Heyn et al.1 A
literature search was conducted to find all relevant studies related to COVID-19. The search was
conducted between April 1, 2020 and April 13, 2020 using the following electronic databases:

PubMed (1809 to present), Google Scholar (1900 to present), MEDLINE (1946 to present),
CINAHL (1937 to present), and Embase (1980 to present). Keywords used included COVID-19,
2019-nCov, SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV, with terms such as efficacy, seroconversion,
microbiology, pathophysiology, viral levels, inflammation, survivability, and treatment and
pharmacology. No language restriction was placed on the search. Reference lists were manually
scanned for additional studies. From this systematic review a model was created that
incorporated clinical course, diagnostics, disease management, and treatment.
Our results focus on recommendations for individualized treatment, by selecting the
most appropriate drug or modality for the patient, carefully weighing risks and benefits.
Clinicians and patients should understand the staged progression of COVID-19 (Figure 2). As
such, we present a treatment algorithm that recommends no treatment for some and specific
treatment for others, depending on age, comorbidities, and symptom severity (Figure 3).

Results
Based on our thorough review of the literature, we correlated the disease course to
COVID-19 testing, diagnostic options, and treatment strategies (see Figure 2). COVID-19 can be
divided into three distinct Stages, beginning at the time of infection (Stage I), sometimes
progressing to pulmonary involvement (Stage II, with or without hypoxemia) and less
frequently to systemic inflammation (Stage III). We also created a treatment algorithm which
considers age, comorbidities, clinical presentation, and disease progression to suggest drug
classes or treatment modalities (see Figure 3). The specific treatments are summarized in Table

Comorbidity
Data exists for early identification of cases at high risk of progression to severe COVID19. One promising model created in China found that patients who developed severe COVID-19
possessed one of the following diseases: hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease,
chronic respiratory disease, or tuberculosis. The same model cited age and various serological
indicators (such as C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), bilirubin, and others)
as factors associated with worse outcomes.65 Additional research confirmed, in a case-control
study, that subjects with high Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores, with age
greater than 65, with hypertension, diabetes, and/or coronary heart disease were at greatest
risk.15 Lastly, Research focusing on viral load and survival found that higher initial viral load is
independently associated with worse prognosis.2
Disease Progression
The most common presenting symptoms are fever and cough, followed by myalgia and
fatigue. Less commonly, patients may present with sputum production, headache, or
abdominal symptoms like diarrhea.26 In terms of disease progression, a case study of the first
five patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Europe points the way to two different clinical
evolutions of the disease: 1. Presenting few symptoms, but showing high viral load from the
respiratory tract; 2. A two-step disease process, with worsening of symptoms around 10 days of
symptom onset in spite of decreased viral load in respiratory samples. In our model we plot the
disease progression as a function of infection, survivability, and inflammation (Figure 2). We
identify the inflection point where survival decreases as inflammation increases—
approximately day 10 from symptom onset. Support for this is found in research by Chen J, Qi T,

Liu L, et al. published in The Journal of Infection.31 Their research found that sepsis and ARDS in
hospitalized patients starts around day 10 and 11, respectively. They also found temporal
changes in inflammatory laboratory markers beginning at day 4 of illness onset. These included
temporal changes in D-dimer, IL-6, serum ferritin, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I, and lactate
dehydrogenase. The differences were statistically significant between survivors and nonsurvivors for all time points. Figure 4 provides the percent change between survivors and nonsurvivors from day 4. In addition, Yang et al.66 found that the patients admitted to the ICU with
severe hypoxemia had a 50% probability of survival at day 7 of ICU admission (corresponding to
Day ~17 in Figure 2).
Stage I
The incubation period is on average 5 days. In most patients, initial presenting
symptoms are mild (though a small number of patients can be asymptomatic throughout the
course of the disease). Stage I symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, and body aches, but, in a
minority of cases can include headache, GI symptoms, anosmia, as well as others. Duration of
initial symptoms is 5-7 days, correlating with a peak in viral load.26 During this time, the
appropriate diagnostic test is a nasopharyngeal PCR. Laboratory studies may include an
elevated D-Dimer and prothrombin time, as well as lymphopenia (see Figure 2). Given that
symptoms in this stage are mild, and correlated with viremia, the appropriate treatment
modality is supportive care or an antiviral. Nevertheless, treatment must be individualized,
based on a patient’s age, comorbidities, presenting symptoms, and drug interactions (see
Figure 3 and Table 1).

Stage II
Some patients progress into Stage II, which is characterized by a decrease in viral levels
and an increase in inflammation that initially localizes to the lungs. Infiltrates are typically seen
on chest x-ray (CXR) or computed tomography (CT). Similar to symptom duration in Stage I, the
typical symptom course in Stage II is also 5-7 days. Treatment with antivirals is still indicated,
but given an average decrease in viral levels during this stage, that treatment is theoretically
less effective than in Stage I. Moreover, Stage II is divided into two sub-stages (IIA and IIB),
depending on whether a patient is hypoxemic or not. This distinction is important for
management (see Figure 2). In Stage IIB, the patient is significantly dyspneic and may benefit,
depending on age and comorbidities, from the use of corticosteroids or other antiinflammatory treatments (see Figure 3).
Stage III
Although only a minority of patients (estimated at 10-15%) progress to Stage III,
mortality within this stage is considerable (estimated at 20-30%). The morbidity and mortality
are generally due to uncontrolled inflammation, which at this point is systemic. The most
important symptom is respiratory distress (correlating in a typical patient to a Pulse Ox < 92%).
Laboratory markers include significantly increased CRP and IL-6 levels.66-67 As in Stage II,
treatment may include anti-virals (if the patient is still viremic), but agents to counteract
inflammation and its effects (such as microthrombi) must be considered (see Figure 2). A
summary of investigational therapies can be found in Table 1.

A number of clinical trials are exploring pre-exposure and post-exposure prophylaxis.
There is no definitive evidence that any particular treatment modality is effective but antivirals,
hydroxychloroquine, and convalescent plasma are being proposed. Anti-virals, like Remdesivir,
may proof beneficial at any stage of disease.39-40 Hydroxychloroquine is postulated to have antiviral properties, and it has been definitively proven as an immunomodulator.32 Convalescent
plasma provides the antibody support needed to envelope and destroy the virus while
preventing the exuberant immune response or cytokine release that leads to significant
pathology, particularly in Stages IIb and III.23

Limitations
This review has several limitations. First, the incredible volume and speed at which data
is published about the treatment of COVID-19 indicates that research findings and
recommendations may change. Second, the research used to create the review came from
small studies, often-times with very few controls. Third, the articles were limited to Englishlanguage publications or translations, so relevant international data could be lacking.

Conclusion
This paper presents the first evidence-based recommendations for individualized
treatment for COVID-19. Based upon the observed transmission and mortality rates, health
professionals urgently need to align patient baseline risk to disease stage and investigational
treatment options. The COVID-19 pandemic represents the greatest public health crisis in three
generations; the need for comprehensive management cannot be overstated.

•

AV: replication-neutralization of the
pH cellular organelles for gene
replication
A-IN: inhibition of macrophage
activation and reducing release of
tissue TNF-a, IL-1, IL-631-33
A-IN: interfere with lysosomal
activity and autophagy, disrupt
membrane stability, alter signaling
and transcriptional activity, which
can then inhibit immune activation
and cytokine production32

•

Adverse effects include: rash, nausea, and diarrhea. GI symptoms can be
mitigated by taking with water; use with caution in diabetic patients may cause
hypoglycemia.34
Increased risk of retinopathy with a recommended maximal daily dose of
5.0 mg/kg. Avoid if history of retinal disease, macular degeneration, or previous
treatment with tamoxifen.35
Caution in patient at risk for QT prolongation. EKG at baseline and following
initiation is generally advised, particularly in critically ill patients.
Contraindicated with Epilepsy, Porphyria, G6PD, and Myasthenia Gravis
Ideally used for patients hospitalized with Pneumonia36
Consider for patients at high risk for disease progression.
Pre-Exposure/Post-Exposure prophylaxis is being studied
Has greater adverse event profile than Hydroxychloroquine and possibly less
efficacy.
Most common symptoms include abdominal cramps, nausea, anorexia.
Can increase QTc and result in hematologic effects (including hemolysis with
G6PD deficiency). Can cause retinal toxicity and hypoglycemia.
As with Hydroxychloroquine, additional clinical trial data is necessary to
determine efficacy and safety in COVID-19 patients.38

Has limited drug-drug interactions (no significant CYP effect)
Clinical trials underway in the US, UK, and China
Showed efficacy in COVID-19 treatment40
Nearly 14% of patients cannot complete a course due to GI side effects.36
Ritonavir is a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor (interacting with Rx such as apixaban,
tacrolimus, and amiodarone).
In rare cases, Lopinavir/Ritonavir can cause liver injury, pancreatitis and cardiac
toxicity.
Treatment in mostly Stage II-III patients was not found to be superior to
standard of care. Subgroup analysis suggestive that earlier treatment (Stage I)
might be beneficial.41
Increases liver function parameters (AST, ALT and total bilirubin)
Testis toxicity and has a risk for teratogenicity and embryotoxicity

Allergic transfusion reactions
Likely most beneficial in early disease course (e.g. Stage I or Stage II), as its
mechanism of action is to neutralize viral particles.23

Previous studies have shown some efficacy against viruses such as Influenza,
Ebola, RSV and Rhinovirus.50
May confer benefit when added to Hydroxychloroquine.21-22
Should be used if superimposed bacterial Pneumonia.
Does increase QT interval, especially when added to Hydroxychloroquine. An
EKG is recommended prior to start (and EKG or telemetry monitoring while on
Tx is recommended)51
May confer benefit when added to Hydroxychloroquine.
Should be used if superimposed bacterial Pneumonia.

Should not be used in Stage I (unless another indication) as it may increase viral
load.54
Indicated for asthma or COPD exacerbation or any shock with a history of
chronic steroid use in excess of 10mg prednisone daily. Also used for
multipressor (>2 pressor) shock.
Use in patients with hypoxemia may confer a mortality benefit. If ARDS, higher
doses may be required.55,56
Side effects include upper respiratory tract infections, mild stomach cramps.
Black box warning for a risk of serious infections, including tuberculosis and
other opportunistic infections. Patients treated with this medication should be
tested for latent tuberculosis prior to discharge from the hospital

*None of these Rx are considered standard of care for treatment of COVID-19, and ideally should be used as part of a clinical trial. Moreover, this table is not
meant to be a comprehensive review of adverse effects and drug-drug interactions. Treatment must be individualized to the patient, considering the patient’s
age, comorbidities, clinical course, drug interactions, and hypersensitivities. Lastly, this table is meant to be updated as new evidence (and perhaps new agents
or classes of agents) is presented.
