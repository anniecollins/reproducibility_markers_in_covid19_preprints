Abstract—103 words
To increase situational awareness and support evidence-based policy-making, we
formulated a mathematical model for COVID-19 transmission within a regional population. This
compartmental model accounts for quarantine, self-isolation, social distancing, a nonexponentially distributed incubation period, asymptomatic individuals, and mild and severe
forms of symptomatic disease. Using Bayesian inference, we have been calibrating regionspecific models daily for consistency with new reports of confirmed cases from the 15 most
populous metropolitan statistical areas in the United States and quantifying uncertainty in
parameter estimates and predictions of future case reports. This online learning approach allows
for early identification of new trends despite considerable variability in case reporting.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (1), was detected in the United States (US) in January 2020 (2). In
February, COVID-19-caused deaths were detected (3). Thereafter, surveillance testing expanded
nationwide (4). These and other efforts revealed community spread across the US and
exponential growth of new COVID-19 cases throughout most of March with a doubling time of
2 to 3 d (5), similar to that of the initial outbreak in China (6). This situation led to government
mandates prohibiting, for example, public gatherings, as well as broad adoption of socialdistancing practices, such as working-from-home, curtailing of travel, and face mask-wearing
(7). Although the US became a hot spot of the COVID-19 pandemic, detection of new cases
peaked in late-April and steadily declined until mid-June (4), suggesting that mandates and social

distancing were effective at slowing COVID-19 transmission. Attempts to quantify the impacts
of these measures suggest substantial reduction of disease burden (8, 9).
In mid-June and mid-September, the number of new daily cases in the US began
increasing a second and third time (4). It is imperative that we effectively monitor ongoing
COVID-19 transmission, so that dangerous upticks in cases can be responded to as quickly as
possible.
To contribute to situational awareness of COVID-19 transmission dynamics, we
developed a mathematical model for the regional COVID-19 epidemic in each of the 15 most
populous US metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) (10). Each model is composed of ordinary
differential equations (ODEs), which characterize the dynamics of various populations, including
mixing and protected-by-social-distancing subpopulations.
In an ongoing online-learning effort, we have been calibrating our models for regional
COVID-19 epidemics on a daily basis for consistency with historical case reports. We have also
been applying Bayesian methods to quantify uncertainties in predicted detection of new cases. In
the face of variability in case detection, this approach allows for identification of new epidemic
trends, enabling an evidence-based response by policy makers.
Methods
Data Used in Online Learning
The COVID-19 surveillance data used to parameterize models—reports of new
confirmed cases—are obtained daily (at variable times of day) from the GitHub repository
maintained by The New York Times newspaper (11). We aggregate county-level case counts to

obtain case counts for each of the 15 most populous US MSAs. These MSAs encompass the
following cities: New York City; Los Angeles; Chicago; Dallas; Houston; Washington, DC;
Miami; Philadelphia; Atlanta; Phoenix; Boston; San Francisco; Riverside, CA; Detroit; and
Seattle. The political entities comprising each MSA, which are almost always counties1, are
those delineated by the federal government (10).
Models for COVID-19 Transmission and Model Parameters
In ongoing work, each day, for the regional COVID-19 epidemic in each of the 15 MSAs
of interest, we parameterize a compartmental model for consistency with all daily reports of new
confirmed cases that are available at the time2.
Each MSA-specific model accounts for 25 populations (Figure 1 and Appendix Figure 1).
Infectious individuals are taken to be exposed and incubating virus (e.g., presymptomatic),
asymptomatic while clearing virus, or symptomatic. The parameters 𝜌! and 𝜌" characterize the
relative infectiousness of exposed and asymptomatic individuals compared to symptomatic
individuals. Infected individuals move to quarantine with rate constant 𝑘# . Symptomatic
individuals with mild disease quarantine themselves with rate constant 𝑗# . Social distancing is
modeled by allowing susceptible and infectious individuals to transition between mixing and
protected populations. The size of the protected population is determined by two parameters: 𝜆$ ,
a rate constant, and 𝑝$ , a steady-state population setpoint, where index 𝑖 refers to the current
social-distancing period. The model allows for 𝑛 distinct social-distancing periods beyond an
initial period of social distancing. Individuals in the protected population are less likely to be
infected and less likely to transmit disease by a factor 𝑚% < 1. Within the mixing population,
disease is transmitted with rate constant 𝛽. The model reproduces a non-exponentially distributed

incubation period by dividing the incubation period into five sequential stages of equal mean
duration, 1/𝑘& . Individuals in the first incubation period are taken to be non-infectious and nondetectable as infected. A fraction of exposed individuals exiting the incubation period, 𝑓" , never
develop symptoms. The remaining individuals develop mild disease. A fraction of these
individuals, 𝑓' , progress to severe disease/hospitalization; the others recover. A fraction of
individuals with severe disease, 𝑓( , recover; the others die. Hospitalized individuals (or at home
with severe disease) are taken to be quarantined. Individuals leave the asymptomatic state with
rate constant 𝑐" , leave the mild disease state with rate constant 𝑐) , and leave the severe
disease/hospitalized state with rate constant 𝑐' .
The model consists of 25 ordinary differential equations (ODEs), defined by Equations
(1)–(22) in the Appendix. Each state variable of the model represents the size of a population. In
addition to the 25 ODEs, we consider an auxiliary 1-parameter measurement model that relates
state variables to expected case reporting (see Equations (23) and (24) in the Appendix) and a
negative binomial model for variability in new case detection (see Equations (25)–(27) in the
Appendix). The model is formulated so as to allow consideration of multiple periods of social
distancing with distinct setpoints for the protected population size. In the model, there is always
an initial period of social distancing. The number of additional social-distancing periods is
indicated by 𝑛. Here, we only consider two cases: 𝑛 = 0 and 𝑛 = 1. The best value of 𝑛 is
determined using a model selection procedure described in the Appendix.
For 𝑛 = 0, the compartmental model and auxiliary measurement model have a total of 20
parameters. We take six of these parameters to have adjustable values (Table 1) and 14 to have
fixed values (Tables 2 and 3). In the Appendix, we describe each parameter and explain the fixed
parameter settings, which are based on information in Refs. (12)–(20) and assumptions. The

adjustable model parameters are 𝑡* , the start time of the local epidemic; 𝜎 > 𝑡* , the time at
which social distancing begins; 𝑝* , which establishes a setpoint for the quasi-stationary fraction
of the total population practicing social distancing; 𝜆* , which characterizes the rate of movement
between the mixing and protected subpopulations and establishes a timescale for populationlevel adoption of social-distancing practices; and 𝛽, which characterizes the rate of disease
transmission in the absence of social distancing. The measurement-model parameter, 𝑓+ ,
represents the time-averaged fraction of new cases detected. Inference of adjustable parameter
values is based on a negative binomial likelihood function (Equation (27) in the Appendix). The
dispersal parameter 𝑟 of the likelihood is taken to be adjustable; its value is jointly inferred with
those of 𝑡* , 𝜎, 𝑝* , 𝜆* , 𝛽, and 𝑓+ .
For 𝑛 > 0 distinct social-distancing periods after an initial social-distancing period, the
compartmental model has three additional adjustable parameters for each additional period of
social distancing. For one additional period of social distancing (𝑛 = 1), the additional
adjustable parameters are 𝜏, > 𝜎, the onset time of second-phase social-distancing; 𝑝, , the
second-phase quasi-stationary setpoint parameter; and 𝜆, , which determines the timescale for
transition from first- to second-phase social-distancing behavior. A second social-distancing
period is considered by replacing 𝑝* with 𝑝, and 𝜆* with 𝜆, at time 𝑡 = 𝜏, . If adherence to
effective social-distancing practices begins to relax at time 𝑡 = 𝜏, , then 𝑝, < 𝑝* .
Statistical Model for Noisy Case Reporting
The compartmental model is deterministic. We interpret the model to predict the
expected number of new confirmed COVID-19 cases reported daily. In other words, we assume
that the number of new cases reported over a 1-d period is a random variable and its expected

value follows a deterministic trajectory. We further assume that day-to-day fluctuations in the
random variable are independent and characterized by a negative binomial distribution, which
we will denote as NB(𝑟, 𝑝). We use NB(𝑟, 𝑝) to statistically model noise in reporting (and case
detection) because its support—the non-negative integers—is natural for populations and its
shape is flexible enough to recapitulate an array of unimodal distributions. With these
assumptions, we obtain a likelihood function (Equation (27) in the Appendix) taking the form of
a product of probability mass functions of NB(𝑟, 𝑝). Formulation of a likelihood is a prerequisite
for standard Bayesian inference3.
Online Learning of Model Parameter Values through Bayesian Inference
We use Bayesian inference to learn adjustable model parameter values. Inferences are
performed daily for each MSA of interest. In each inference, we assume a uniform prior and use
an adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm (21) to generate samples of the
posterior distribution for the adjustable parameters. A full description of our inference procedure
is provided in the Appendix.
The maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of a parameter value is the value of the
parameter corresponding to the mode of its marginal posterior, where probability mass is highest.
MAP estimates are maximum likelihood estimates because we assume a uniform prior.
Forecasting with Quantification of Prediction Uncertainty: Bayesian Predictive Inference
In addition to inferring parameter values, we quantify uncertainty in predicted trajectories
of daily case reports. A predictive inference of the expected number of new cases detected on a
given day is derived from a model by parameterizing it using a randomly chosen parameter
posterior sample generated in MCMC sampling. The number of cases detected is then predicted

by adding a noise term, drawn from NB(𝑟, 𝑝), where 𝑟 is set at the randomly sampled value and
𝑝 is set using Equation (26) in the Appendix.
For any given (1-day) surveillance period and specified settings for parameter values, a
prediction of the compartmental model is obtained by using LSODA (22) to numerically
integrate Equations (1)–(17) and (23) in the Appendix; the initial condition is defined by the
inferred value of 𝑡* (Table 1) and the fixed settings for 𝑆* and 𝐼* (Tables 2 and 3). A prediction
of the actual number of new cases detected is obtained by entering the predicted expected
number of new cases into Equation (29) of the Appendix.
The 95% credible interval for the predicted number of new case reports on a given day is
the central part of the marginal predictive posterior capturing 95% of the probability mass. This
region is bounded above by the 97.5 percentile and below by the 2.5 percentile
Results
The objective of our ongoing study is to detect significant new trends in new COVID-19
cases as early as possible by 1) systematically and regularly updating mathematical models
capturing historical trends in regional COVID-19 epidemics through Bayesian inference and 2)
making forecasts with rigorously quantified uncertainties through Bayesian predictive inference.
An important aspect of how we are analyzing COVID-19 data is our focus on the
populations of US cities and their surrounding areas (i.e., MSAs) vs. the regional populations
within other political boundaries, such as those of the US States. The boundaries of MSAs are
defined on the basis of social and economic interactions (10), which suggests that the population
of an MSA is likely to be more uniformly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic than, for
example, the population of a State. In accordance with this expectation, daily reports of new

COVID-19 cases for New York City (Figure 2, panel A) are more temporally correlated than for
the US State of New York (Figure 2, panel B), New Jersey (Figure 2, panel C), or Pennsylvania
(Figure 2, panel D). New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania are the three States encompassing
the New York City MSA.
For each of the 15 most populous MSAs in the US, we parameterized a compartmental
model using MSA-specific surveillance data, namely, aggregated county-level reports indicating
the number of new confirmed COVID-19 cases within a given MSA each day. Bayesian
parameterization and forecasting with uncertainty quantification (UQ)—predictive inference—
were performed daily for each of the 15 MSAs.
Results of Bayesian predictive inference are exemplified in Figure 3. Predictions are
obtained in the form of a predictive posterior distribution. In Figure 3, the entire shaded region
indicates the 95% credible interval of the predictive posterior as a function of time. In other
words, this band indicates where 95% of predictions of daily case reports fall at the times
indicated. Predictions vary because of the uncertainties in adjustable model parameter estimates,
which are characterized quantitatively through Bayesian inference. The colors within the shaded
band indicate other credible intervals (10%, 20%, etc.) and also the median of all predictions as a
function of time. The dataset used in inference is the complete time series of available daily new
case counts for the region of interest.
Predictive inferences for all 15 MSAs of interest are shown in Figure 4. The predictions
of Figure 4 are conditioned on the compartmental model with 𝑛 = 0. These results demonstrate
that, for the timeframe of interest, the compartmental model with 𝑛 = 0 is capable of

reproducing many but not all of the empirical epidemic curves for the MSAs of interest, which
vary in shape.
Recall that predictive inferences are made daily. In Figure 5, we show predictive
inferences for New York City and Phoenix made over a series of progressively later dates. These
results illustrate that accurate short-term predictions are possible but continual updating of
parameter estimates is required to maintain accuracy. In Videos 1 and 2, daily predictions for
New York City and Phoenix, respectively, are shown as animations.
In practice, we find that the adjustable parameters of the compartmental model have
identifiable values, meaning that their marginal posteriors are unimodal. This finding is
illustrated in Figure 6, which displays a 7 × 7 matrix of 1- and 2-dimensional projections of the
7-dimensional MCMC posterior samples underlying predictive inferences for New York City. In
Figure 6, plots of marginal posteriors are shown on the diagonal extending from top left to
bottom right. The other 2-dimensional plots reveal correlations between pairs of parameter
estimates (if any). In the context of a deterministic model, the significance of identifiability is
that, despite uncertainties in parameter estimates, we can expect predictive inferences of daily
new-case reports to cluster around a central trajectory. The results shown in Figure 6 are
representative. We routinely recover unimodal marginal posteriors. However, it should be noted
that we do not have a mathematical proof of identifiability.
How does learning the region-specific adjustable parameter values of the compartmental
model and a subsequent predictive inference (i.e., a forecast with UQ) improve situational
awareness? In the vast majority of cases, when we forecast with UQ, the empirical new-case
count for the day immediately following our inference (+1), and very often for each of several

additional days, falls within the 95% credible interval of the predictive posterior. When the
reported number of new cases falls outside the 95% credible interval and above the 97.5%
percentile, we interpret this event, which we will call an upward-trending rare event, to have a
probability of 0.0275 or less assuming the model is both explanatory (i.e., satisfactorily
consistent with historical data) and predictive of the near future. If the model is predictive of the
near future, the probability of two consecutive rare events is far smaller, less than 0.001. Thus,
consecutive upward-trending rare events, which we will refer to as an upward-trending anomaly,
can be reasonably taken as a sign that the model is not in fact predictive. Indeed, an anomaly
suggests that the rate of COVID-19 transmission has increased beyond what can be explained by
the model.
For New York City, anomalies are not seen, as illustrated in Figure 7, panel A. However,
for Phoenix, there are several anomalies, which preceded rapid and sustained growth in the
number of new cases reported per day in June (Figure 7, panel B).
We assume that these anomalies arose from changes in behavior. Thus, to explain them,
we allowed the compartmental model to account for a distinct second social-distancing period,
i.e., we increased the setting for 𝑛 from 0 to 1. With this change, the number of adjustable
parameters increases from 7 to 10. One of the new parameters is 𝜏, , the start time of the second
social-distancing period. The other new parameters, 𝜆, and 𝑝, , replace 𝜆* and 𝑝* at time 𝑡 = 𝜏, .
As can be seen by comparing the plots in Figure 8, panels A and B, the compartmental model
with two social-distancing periods (Figure 8, panel B) better explains the Phoenix data than the
compartmental model with just one social-distancing period (Figure 8, panel A)4. Furthermore,
the MAP estimate for 𝑝, (~0.38) is less than that for 𝑝* (~0.49) (cf. panels C and D, Figure 8),
and the marginal posteriors for these parameters are largely non-overlapping (Figure 8, panel D).

These findings suggest that the increase in COVID-19 cases in Phoenix can indeed be explained
by relaxation in social distancing, which is quantified by our estimates for 𝑝* and 𝑝, . The MAP
estimate of the start time of the second period of social distancing corresponds to 24-May-20205.
Intriguingly, 8 of the 9 anomalies noted in Figure 8, panel B occurred after this period, with the
first of these occurring on 02-June-2020.
We considered the hypothesis that a one-time event generating 1000’s of new infections,
such as a mass gathering, might trigger a new upward trend in COVID-19 transmission.
Simulations for New York City and Phoenix do not support this hypothesis (Appendix Figure 2).
In each of these simulations, at a specified time, we moved a specified number of individuals
from the 𝑆- (mixing susceptible) population into the 𝐸, (exposed) population and then simulated
forward in time. Each perturbation increased disease burden, but the perturbation had minimal
effect on the slope of the trajectory of new case detection.
Besides Phoenix, four other MSAs have contemporaneous trends explainable by
relaxation of social distancing (Appendix Figure 3 and Appendix Table 1). Upward-trending
anomalies were detected for these MSAs (Appendix Figure 4, panels A–D), but not for three of
four other MSAs having epidemic curves consistent with sustained social distancing (Appendix
Figure 4, panels E–H). Daily predictions for the MSAs considered in Appendix Figure 4 are
shown in Videos 3–10.
An assessment of the overall prediction accuracy of the region-specific compartmental
models is provided in Appendix Figure 5.

Daily online learning of model parameter values from real-time surveillance data is
feasible for mathematical models for COVID-19 transmission. Furthermore, predictive inference
of the daily number of new cases reported is feasible for the regional COVID-19 epidemics
occurring in multiple US metropolitan areas. Our model-based analyses are ongoing and daily
forecasts are being disseminated (23). However, it should be noted that inferences are
computationally expensive and the cost increases as new data become available. Thus, at some
point, daily inferences using our methodology may become impractical.
We have suggested how our predictive inferences can be used to identify harbingers of
future growth in COVID-19 transmission rate. Two consecutive upward-trending rare events
(i.e., instances where the number of new cases reported is above the upper limit of the 95%
credible interval of the predictive posterior) seem to indicate potential for increased transmission
in the future. This signal of future growth is perhaps especially strong when anomalies are
accompanied by increasing prediction uncertainty, as is the case for Phoenix (Figure 7, panel B).
We find that the June increase in rate of transmission of COVID-19 in the Phoenix
metropolitan area can be explained by a reduction in the percentage of the population adhering to
effective social-distancing practices6 (Figure 8, panel D), from ~49% to ~38%. Relaxation is
inferred to have begun around 24-May-2020 (Figure 8, panel B). Contemporaneous upward
trends in the rate of COVID-19 transmission in the Houston, Miami, San Francisco, and Seattle
metropolitan areas can also be explained by relaxation of social distancing (Appendix Figure 3
and Appendix Table 1). These findings are qualitatively consistent with earlier studies indicating
that social distancing is effective at slowing the transmission of COVID-19 (7, 8), and
encouragingly, they suggest that the future course of the pandemic is controllable, especially

with accurate recognition of when stronger nonpharmaceutical interventions are needed to slow
COVID-19 transmission.
We caution that our work has several limitations. One is that trend detection is datadriven, which means that a new trend cannot be detected until enough evidence of it has
accumulated. The data we are using are reports of new cases, which reflect transmission
dynamics of the past vs. current transmission dynamics. Other types of surveillance data, such as
assays of viral RNA in wastewater samples, may permit improved situational awareness.
Another limitation is that our inferences are based on a mathematical model associated with
considerable structure and fixed parameter uncertainties as well as simplifications. Among the
simplifications is the replacement of certain time-varying parameters, such as that characterizing
testing capacity, with constants, which are assumed to provide an adequate time-averaged
characterization. The model form is that of a deterministic compartmental model. A stochastic
version of the model may be more appropriate if conditions change (from the current situation of
high disease prevalence to low prevalence). Although the model is capable of reproducing
historical data and making accurate short-term forecasts, its structure and fixed parameters are
subject to revision as we learn more about COVID-19. In the future, results from serological
studies and estimates of excess deaths should allow model improvements.

Through mid-2020, we considered a curve-fitting model alongside the compartmental model,

but we abandoned use of curve fitting after the MSAs of interest all experienced multiple-wave
dynamics. The curve-fitting model is only able to generate single-peak epidemic curves. See the
Appendix for details.

It should be noted that some related methods, typified by approximate Bayesian computation

(ABC), do not rely on a likelihood.
4

This conclusion is supported by the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian

information criterion (BIC) values we calculated for the two scenarios (Appendix Table 1).
Although AIC and BIC are crude model-selection tools because the posteriors here are nonnormal, we deem them to be adequately discriminatory. Each strongly indicates that the model
with two social-distancing periods is more explanatory of the data than the model with just one
social-distancing period.
5

The 95% credible interval places the start date within the period beginning on 20-May-2020

and ending on 28-May-2020.
6

Unfortunately, our study sheds no light on which social-distancing practices are effective at

slowing COVID-19 transmission.

We assume that the initial susceptible population with a given region is the total regional

population. 2We assume that initially there is a single infected (and symptomatic) individual.

This parameter defines the reduction in disease transmission attributable to the protective effects

of social distancing. 4This parameter characterizes infectiousness relative to a symptomatic
individual with all other factors being equal (i.e., a symptomatic individual exhibiting the same
social-distancing behavior). 5The incubation period is divided into five stages, each of equal
duration on average. 6In the model, after a mean waiting time of 1/𝑐) , symptomatic individuals
with mild disease are taken to either recover or progress to severe disease. 7In the model, after a
mean waiting time of 1/𝑐' , symptomatic individuals with severe disease are taken to either
recover or die.

Figure 1. Illustration of the populations and processes considered in a mechanistic
compartmental model for the dynamics of COVID-19 transmission. The model accounts for
susceptible individuals (𝑆), exposed individuals without symptoms in the incubation phase of
disease (𝐸), asymptomatic individuals in the immune clearance phase of disease (𝐴), mildly ill
symptomatic individuals (𝐼), severely ill individuals in hospital or at home (𝐻), recovered
individuals (𝑅), and deceased individuals (𝐷). The model also accounts for social distancing,
which establishes mixing and protected subpopulations denoted by M and P subscripts,
respectively; quarantine driven by testing and contact tracing, which establishes quarantined

subpopulations denoted by a Q subscript; and self-isolation spurred by symptom awareness.
Individuals who are self-isolating because of symptoms are taken to be members of the 𝐼#
population. The incubation period is divided into 5 stages (𝐸, through 𝐸. ), which allows the
model to reproduce an empirically determined (non-exponential) Erlang distribution of waiting
times for the onset of symptoms after infection (12). The exposed population (consisting of
individuals incubating virus) includes both presymptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. The
𝐴-populations consist of true asymptomatic individuals in the immune clearance phase. The gray
background indicates the populations that contribute to disease transmission. An auxiliary
measurement model (Equations (23) and (24) in the Appendix) accounts for imperfect detection
and reporting of new cases. Only symptomatic cases are assumed to be detectable in surveillance
testing.

Figure 2. Temporal correlations in surveillance data. Shown here are time-series of fractional
(i.e., normalized) case counts. We define the fractional case count for a county on a given date to
be the reported number of cases on that date divided by the total reported number of cases in the
county over the entire period of interest. The panels in this figure show fractional case counts for
(A) the 23 counties comprising the New York City metropolitan statistical area (MSA), (B) the
62 counties comprising the State of New York, (C) the 21 counties comprising the State of New
Jersey, and (D) the 67 counties comprising the State of Pennsylvania. Within each plot, a
different color is used for the data points from each distinct county. As can be seen, time-series
for the counties of the New York City MSA are more temporally correlated than for the Statelevel time-series. Daily case counts for New Jersey are similar to those for New York City
because the two populations overlap considerably: ~74% of New Jersey’s population is part of

the New York City MSA and ~32% of the population of the New York City MSA is part of the
State of New Jersey. Time-averaged Fano factors for the four regions are as follows: 0.0026
(New York City), 0.021 (State of New York), 1.2 (State of New Jersey), and 0.028 (State of
Pennsylvania). A smaller Fano factor indicates less county-to-county variability.

Figure 3. Illustration of Bayesian predictive inference using daily new case counts in the New
York Metropolitan Statistical Area. We forecast future daily reports of new COVID-19 cases
with rigorous uncertainty quantification (UQ) through online Bayesian learning of model
parameters. Each day, using all daily case-reporting data available up to that point, we perform
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling of the posterior distribution for a set of adjustable
parameters. Subsampling of the posterior samples then allows us to use the relevant model to
generate trajectories of the epidemic curve that account for both parametric and observation
uncertainty. The entire shaded region indicates the 95% credible interval for predictions of daily
case reports. In other words, the central 95% of all predictions lie within the shaded region. The
color-coded bands within the shaded region indicate other credible intervals, as indicated in the
legend.

Appendix Figure 1. Detailed diagram of the populations and processes considered in the
mechanistic compartmental model. In this illustration of the compartmental model, the labels
attached to arrows indicate the parameters and variables that affect the rates of the processes
represented by the arrows. There is a one-to-one correspondence between arrow labels and terms
on the right-hand sides of Equations (1)–(17). The diagram is otherwise the same as that shown
in Figure 2.

Appendix Figure 2. We evaluated the potential impact of a one-time mass gathering that causes
50,000 and 5,000 individuals to become newly infected on 30-May-2020 in (A) the New York
City metropolitan statistical area (MSA) and (B) the Phoenix MSA, respectively. As can be seen,
such an event will step the epidemic curve up without significantly changing the slope of the
curve. According to the model, the trend in the slope of the curve is determined by the sustained
level of adherence to effective social-distancing practices. We conclude that the recent trajectory
of the epidemic curve of the Phoenix MSA cannot be explained by a one-time mass gathering.

Appendix Figure 3. Predictive inferences conditioned on the compartmental model with either
(A)–(E) one or (F)–(J) two distinct social-distancing periods. We consider five metropolitan
statistical areas (MSAs), which according to Appendix Table 1, have epidemic curves better
explained by the compartmental model with two social-distancing periods than by the
compartmental model with just one. Maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates for 𝜏, indicate that
the second social distancing period began on 27-May-2020 for Houston, 19-April-2020 for

Miami, 24-May-2020 for Phoenix, 12-June-2020 for San Francisco, and 07-June-2020 for
Seattle. In this analysis, we used the data available from 21-January-2020 to 26-June-2020
(inclusive dates).

Appendix Figure 4. Comparison of next-day predictions and the corresponding empirical case
reports for (A) Houston, (B) Miami, (C) San Francisco, (D) Seattle, (E) Los Angeles, (F)
Chicago, (G) Dallas, and (H) Washington, DC. Like Phoenix, Houston, Miami, San Francisco,
and Seattle have epidemic curves that are better explained by the compartmental model with two
social-distancing periods vs. just one (Appendix Table 1). Upward-trending anomalies were
detected for each of these MSAs. Los Angeles, Chicago, Dallas, and Washington, DC have
epidemic curves better explained by the compartmental model with just one social-distancing
period vs. two (Appendix Table 1). Upward-trending anomalies were not detected for three of
these MSAs. The exception is Chicago. Two anomalies were detected for Chicago near the end
of the period considered in the analysis.

Appendix Figure 5. Out-of-sample validation of forecasting accuracy. For region-specific
compartmental models with values of 𝑛 determined by model selection, the empirical coverage
was calculated for predicted detection of new cases 1, 4 and 7 days into the future (as indicated
in the legend) over the period from 14-July-2020 to 9-September-2020. Coverage indicates the
frequency at which the actual future number of new cases detected fell below the indicated
predicted quantile. To create this figure, we combined the predictions and out-of-sample new-

Appendix Figure 6. Comparison of forecasting accuracy of deterministic and stochastic versions
of the compartmental model for the New York City (NYC) metropolitan statistical area (MSA).
In the three leftmost panels, credible intervals of predictive posteriors are shown. Inferences are
based on the NYC data shown in the plots. At far left, results conditioned on the deterministic
(ordinary differential equation, ODE) compartmental model are shown. In the two center plots,
we show results conditioned on a comparable stochastic differential equation (SDE) model. Two
realizations of the inference procedure were performed. In the rightmost panel, we show insample validation results. As can be seen, the ODE is less biased than the SDE model.

Figure 2. Illustration of the populations and processes considered in a mechanistic compartmental model for
the dynamics of COVID-19 transmission. The model accounts for susceptible (S), exposed (E),
asymptomatic (A), symptomatic (I), hospitalized (H), recovered (R), and deceased (D) populations. It also
accounts for social distancing, which establishes mixing and protected subpopulations, quarantine driven by
testing and contact tracing, and self-isolation spurred by symptom awareness. The incubation period is
divided into 5 stages, which allows the model to reproduce an empirically determined Erlang distribution of
waiting times for the onset of symptoms after infection (12). The exposed population (consisting of
individuals incubating virus) includes presymptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. The A-populations
consist of true asymptomatic individuals in the immune clearance phase. The gray background indicates the
populations that contribute to disease transmission. An auxiliary measurement model (Equations (27) and
(28) in the Appendix) accounts for imperfect detection and reporting of new cases.

Figure 3. Temporal correlations in surveillance data. Shown here are time-series of fractional (i.e.,
normalized) case counts. We define the fractional case count for a county on a given date to be the reported
number of cases on that date divided by the total reported number of cases in the county over the entire
period of interest. The panels in this figure show fractional case counts for (A) the 23 counties comprising
the New York City metropolitan statistical area (MSA), (B) the 62 counties comprising the State of New York,
(C) the 21 counties comprising the State of New Jersey, and (D) the 67 counties comprising the State of
Pennsylvania. Within each plot, a different color is used for the data points from each distinct county. As can
be seen, time-series for the counties of the New York City MSA are more temporally correlated than for the
State-level time-series. Daily case counts for New Jersey are similar to those for New York City because the
two populations overlap considerably: ~74% of New Jersey’s population is part of the New York City MSA
and ~32% of the population of the New York City MSA is part of the State of New Jersey.

Figure 4. Illustration of Bayesian predictive inference. We forecast future daily reports of new COVID-19
cases with rigorous uncertainty quantification (UQ) through online Bayesian learning of model parameters.
Each day, using all daily case-reporting data available up to that point, we perform Markov chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) sampling of the posterior distribution for a set of adjustable parameters. Subsampling of the
posterior samples then allows us to use the relevant model to generate trajectories of the epidemic curve
that account for both parametric and observation uncertainty. The entire shaded region indicates the 95%
credible interval for predictions of daily case reports. In other words, the central 95% of all predictions lie
within the shaded region. The color-coded bands within the shaded region indicate other credible intervals,
as indicated in the legend.

statistical area (MSA) on the basis of daily reports of new confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
cases from 21-January-2020 to 21-June-2020 (inclusive dates). Plots of marginal posteriors (1-dimensional
projections) are shown on the diagonal from top left to bottom right. Other plots are 2-dimensional
projections, which indicate how correlated pairs of parameter estimates are. Brightness indicates higher
probability density. A compact bright area indicates absence of or relatively low correlation. An extended,
asymmetrical bright area indicates relatively high correlation.

of a given model.) Each ODE in Equations (1)–(17) defines the time-rate of change of a
(sub)population, i.e., the time-rate of change of a state variable. There are 25 state variables, one
for each ODE. Note that Equations (5), (6), and (8) define 4, 4, and 3 ODEs of the model,
respectively. It should be noted that the model does not include generation of new cases by
travelers.
The initial condition is taken to be 𝑆! (𝑡" ) = 𝑆" , 𝐼! (𝑡" ) = 𝐼" = 1, with all other
populations (𝑆$ , 𝐸',! , … , 𝐸2,! , 𝐸',$ , … , 𝐸2,$ , 𝐸0,/ , … , 𝐸2,/ , 𝐴! , 𝐴$ , 𝐴/ , 𝐼$ , 𝐼/ , 𝐻, 𝐷, and 𝑅) equal
to 0. The parameter 𝑆" denotes the total region-specific population size. Thus, we assume that the
entire population is susceptible at the start of the epidemic at time 𝑡 = 𝑡" >0, where time 𝑡 = 0 is
0000 hours on 21-January-2020. The parameter 𝐼" , which we always take to be 1, denotes the
number of infectious symptomatic individuals at the start of the regional epidemic.
Subscripts attached to state variables are used to denote subpopulations. The subscripts 𝑀
and 𝑃 are attached to variables representing mixing and protected populations, respectively. For
example, the variables 𝑆! and 𝑆$ denote the population sizes of mixing and protected individuals
who are susceptible to infection. Individuals in a protected population practice social distancing;
individuals in a mixing population do not. The approach that we have taken to model social
distancing is similar to that of Anderson et al. (24).
The incubation period is divided into five stages. The numerical subscripts 1, 2, 3, 4, and
5 attached to 𝐸 variables indicate progression through these five stages. Exposed individuals in
the incubation period, except for those in the first stage, are taken to be infectious. They are also
taken to lack symptoms. They are either presymptomatic (i.e., individuals who will later develop
symptoms) or asymptomatic (i.e., individuals who will never develop symptoms).

The subscript 𝑄 is attached to variables representing populations of quarantined
individuals. The state variable 𝐼/ is a special case; it accounts for symptomatic individuals who
are quarantined as well as individuals who are self-isolating because of symptom awareness.
The parameter 𝑘/ characterizes the rate at which infected individuals move into
quarantine because of testing and contact tracing. The parameter 𝑗/ characterizes the rate at
which symptomatic individuals self-isolate because of symptom awareness. We recognize that
susceptible individuals may enter quarantine (through contact tracing) but we assume that the
size of the quarantined population is negligible compared to that of the total susceptible
population and that susceptible individuals entering quarantine leave quarantine as susceptible
individuals.
The parameters 𝛽 and 𝑚# < 1 characterize transmission of disease: 𝛽 characterizes the
rate of transmission attributable to contacts between two mixing individuals, 𝑚# 𝛽 characterizes
the rate of transmission attributable to contacts between one mixing and one protected individual,
and 𝑚#0 𝛽 characterizes the rate of transmission attributable to contacts between two protected
individuals. Infectious individuals taken to contribute to COVID-19 transmission include those
in the following pools: 𝐸0,! , … , 𝐸2,! and 𝐸0,$ , … , 𝐸2,$ , 𝐴! and 𝐴$ , and 𝐼! and 𝐼$ . Recall that we
do not consider individuals in the first stage of the incubation period (i.e., individuals in 𝐸'
pools) to be infectious. The assumption is that these individuals are not shedding enough virus to
be infectious (or detectable in surveillance testing). In experiments with an animal model (the
golden hamster), infectious virus could be recovered from animals 2 d post-inoculation (25).
Moreover, it was found that SARS-CoV-2 could be detected in contacts of infected animals just
1 d post-contact (25). Kucirka et al. (26) estimated that the false negative rate for nasal samples

from exposed individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection an estimated 1 d after exposure is
100% but less than 100% thereafter. Thus, it seems reasonable to assume that exposed
individuals beyond the first incubation stage, which has a duration of approximately 1 d (based
on our estimate for 𝑘) , which is discussed below), are infectious and may be detected as such.
The variables 𝐸',! , … , 𝐸2,! and 𝐸',$ , … , 𝐸2,$ denote the population sizes of mixing and
protected exposed individuals in the five stages of the incubation period. The variables
𝐸0,/ , … , 𝐸2,/ denote the population sizes of quarantined exposed individuals in the five stages.
There is no 𝐸',/ population, as we assume that individuals in the first stage of the incubation
period are unlikely to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 or to be reached in contact tracing efforts
before leaving the 𝐸' state. The parameter 𝑘) characterizes disease progression, from one stage
of the incubation period to the next and ultimately to an immune clearance phase. Individuals
leaving the 𝐸2 pools enter the immune clearance phase, meaning that they become eligible for
recovery. An individual leaving an 𝐸2 pool with symptom onset enters an I pool, whereas an
individual leaving an 𝐸2 pool without symptom onset enters an A pool. Individuals in 𝐼 pools are
considered to have mild disease (with the possibility to progress to severe disease).
The dynamics of social distancing are characterized by three step functions (i.e.,
piecewise constant functions having only finitely many pieces): 𝑈% , Λ& , and 𝑃& . The subscripts
attached to these functions denote times: 𝜎 is a particular time, whereas 𝜏 is a set of times, as
discussed later. The value of 𝑈% switches from 0 to 1 at time 𝑡 = 𝜎 > 𝑡" , the start of an initial
social-distancing period. As discussed later, the function Λ6 defines a timescale for change in
social-distancing practices for one or more distinct periods of social distancing, and the function
𝑃& establishes a setpoint for the fraction of the total population of susceptible and infectious, non-

quarantined/non-self-isolated/non-hospitalized individuals adhering to social-distancing practices
for one or more distinct periods of social distancing.
The parameter 𝑓1 denotes the fraction of infected individuals who never develop
symptoms (i.e., the fraction of all cases that are asymptomatic). The variables 𝐴! and 𝐴$ denote
the sizes of the populations of mixing and protected individuals who have been infected,
progressed through the incubation period, are currently in the immune clearance phase, and will
never develop symptoms. The parameter 𝑐1 characterizes the rate at which asymptomatic
individuals recover. It should be noted that the duration of the immune clearance phase for
asymptomatic individuals, 𝑡1̂ , is distributed according to 𝑒 .7& ,8& . The mean value of 𝑡1̂ is 1/𝑐1 .
The variable 𝑅 tracks recoveries of asymptomatic individuals, symptomatic individuals
with mild disease, and symptomatic (hospitalized) individuals with severe disease. All
individuals who recover are assumed to have immunity. This assumption is supported by the
finding that SARS-CoV-2 infection elicits functional T cell memory (27). Moreover, neutralizing
antibodies evidently protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection (28). Reinfection has been detected
(29) but the importance of this apparently rare phenomenon has yet to be determined.
The variables 𝐼! and 𝐼$ denote the sizes of the populations of mixing and protected
symptomatic individuals with mild disease. The parameter 𝑐3 characterizes the rate at which
symptomatic individuals with mild disease recover or progress to severe disease. The parameter
𝑓4 is the fraction of symptomatic individuals who progress to severe disease requiring
hospitalization. As a simplification, we assume that all individuals with severe disease are
hospitalized (or isolated at home in an equivalent state). It should be noted that the duration of
the immune clearance phase for symptomatic individuals who never progress to severe disease,

𝑡3̂ , is distributed according to 𝑒 .7' ,8' . The mean value of 𝑡̂3 is 1/𝑐3 . As is implicit in our definition
of 𝑐3 , the time required for progression from mild to severe disease is taken to be the same as the
recovery time of symptomatic individuals who experience only mild disease.
The variable 𝐻 represents the population of hospitalized/severely ill individuals. In the
model, these individuals are taken to be quarantined. Thus, the model does not consider
nosocomial transmission. The parameter 𝑓5 denotes the fraction of hospitalized/severely ill
individuals who recover. The parameter 𝑐4 characterizes the hospital discharge rate, i.e., the rate
at which hospitalized individuals with severe disease either recover or die. The variable 𝐷 tracks
deaths. Many deaths occur outside a hospital setting (30). As a simplification, the model does not
distinguish between deaths at home and deaths in hospital. It should be noted that the mean
duration of the immune clearance phase for hospitalized/severely ill individuals who recover, 𝑡̂4 ,
is distributed according to @𝑒 .7' ,8( − 𝑒 .7( ,8( A𝑐3 𝑐4 /(𝑐4 − 𝑐3 ), assuming 𝑐4 > 𝑐3 . The mean value
of 𝑡̂4 is 1/𝑐3 + 1/𝑐4 . As is implicit in our definition of 𝑐4 , the time required for progression
from severe disease to death is taken to be the same as the recovery time of hospitalized/severely
ill individuals.
The time-dependent terms 𝜙! (𝑡, 𝜌) and 𝜙$ (𝑡, 𝜌) appearing in Equations (1)–(4)
represent the effective population sizes of infectious individuals in the mixing and protected
subpopulations, respectively. These quantities are defined as follows:
𝜙! (𝑡, 𝜌) ≡ 𝐼! + 𝜌+ @𝐸0,! + 𝐸9,! + 𝐸:,! + 𝐸2,! A + 𝜌1 𝐴!

where 𝜌 = (𝜌+ , 𝜌1 ), 𝜌+ is a constant characterizing the relative infectiousness of presymptomatic
individuals compared to symptomatic individuals (with the same behaviors) and 𝜌1 is a constant
characterizing the relative infectiousness of asymptomatic individuals compared to symptomatic
individuals (with the same behaviors). Recall that infectiousness due to social-distancing
behaviors is captured in Equations (1) and (2). Further recall that we assume that individuals in
the first stage of the incubation period (i.e., individuals in either the 𝐸',! or 𝐸',$ population) are
not infectious. We also assume that the individuals in these populations cannot be quarantined
until after transitioning to the 𝐸0,! or 𝐸0,$ population (because they are assumed to test negative
and because contact tracing is assumed to be too slow to catch individuals in the transient first
stage of incubation). Recall that individuals in the 𝐴! , 𝐴$ , and 𝐴/ populations are defined as
individuals who became infected, passed through all five stages of the incubation period, are
currently in the immune clearance phase, and will never develop symptoms. Thus, individuals in
the exposed 𝐸 populations include both presymptomatic individuals (i.e., individuals who will
enter the 𝐼 populations) and asymptomatic individuals (i.e., individuals who will enter the 𝐴
populations).

where 𝜎 > 𝑡" is the time at which widespread social distancing initially begins, the integer 𝑛 ≥ 0
is the number of societal (major/widespread) shifts in social-distancing practices after the initial
onset of social distancing, each 𝑝- < 1 is a parameter characterizing the quasi-stationary fraction
of susceptible individuals practicing social distancing during the (𝑖 + 1)th period of social
distancing, each 𝜆- is a constant defining a timescale for change in social-distancing practices
during the (𝑖 + 1)th period of social distancing, 𝜏 = {𝜏" , … , 𝜏;<' }, 𝜏" ≡ 𝜎, 𝜏;<' ≡ ∞, and
𝜏-<' > 𝜏- for 𝑖 = 0, … , 𝑛 − 1. The value of 𝑃& (𝑡) defines a setpoint for the quasi-stationary size
of the protected population of susceptible individuals: 𝑃& (𝑡) × 100% of the total susceptible
population. The value of Λ& (𝑡) determines how quickly the setpoint is reached. As indicated in
Equations (21) and (22), we only consider step-changes in the values of 𝑃& (𝑡) and Λ& (𝑡), a
simplification. Thus, for a period during which social-distancing practices are intensifying
(relaxing), we increase (decrease) the value of 𝑃& (𝑡) at the start of the period in a step-change
and then hold it constant until the next step-change, if any. It should be noted that 𝜎 is the start
time of the initial social-distancing period. The time at which the initial social-distancing
setpoint, determined by 𝑝" , is reached occurs later and is determined by 𝜆" . We caution the
reader not to confuse the setpoint parameters 𝑝" , 𝑝' , … , 𝑝; with the distributional parameter 𝑝 in
the negative binomial distribution NB(𝑟, 𝑝).
Full Description of the Auxiliary Measurement Model
To determine how consistent a particular parameterization of the compartmental model is
with available COVID-19 surveillance data, we need to define a quantity—a model output—that

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.20.20151506; this version posted January 19, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

corresponds to daily reports of the number of new confirmed COVID-19 cases. Case reporting
by public health officials is typically daily. We expect that the vast majority of cases are detected
because of symptom-driven (vs. random) testing and/or presentation in a clinical setting.
Accordingly, as a simplification, we assume that individuals detected in surveillance are
symptomatic. To define a model output comparable to the number of new cases reported on a
given day, we start by considering the predicted cumulative number of presymptomatic
individuals who become symptomatic while evading quarantine (because of contact tracing) until
at least the onset of symptoms, which we will denote as 𝐶= . According to the model, the time rate
of change of 𝐶= is given by the following equation:
𝑑𝐶=
= (1 − 𝑓1 )𝑘) (𝐸2,! + 𝐸2,$ )
𝑑𝑡

(23)

The right-hand side of this equation gives the rate at which non-quarantined presymptomatic
individuals exit the incubation period and enter the immune clearance phase, in which they are
symptomatic and therefore taken to be detectable in local surveillance efforts. We assume that
symptomatic individuals in quarantine make a negligible contribution to detection of new cases.
Equation (23) and the ODEs of the compartmental model form a coupled system of
equations, which can be numerically integrated to obtain trajectories for the state variables and
𝐶= , the expected cumulative number of symptomatic cases. From the trajectory for 𝐶= , we obtain
a prediction for 𝐼(𝑡- , 𝑡-<' ), the expected number of new COVID-19 cases reported on a given
calendar date 𝒟> , from the following equation:
𝐼(𝑡- , 𝑡-<' ) = 𝑓? [𝐶= (𝑡-<' ) − 𝐶= (𝑡- )]

(24)

where 𝑓? is taken to be an adjustable region-specific parameter characterizing the time-averaged
fraction of symptomatic cases detected among non-quarantined and hospitalized individuals.
Equation (24) completes the formulation of our measurement model. 𝐼(𝑡- , 𝑡-<' ) is the model
output that we compare to 𝛿𝐶- , the number of new cases reported on calendar date 𝒟> .
The Adjustable and Fixed Parameters of the Compartmental Model and Auxiliary Measurement
Model
The parameters of the compartmental model (Equations (1)–(22)) and the auxiliary
measurement model (Equations (23) and (24)) are taken to have either adjustable or fixed values.
The adjustable parameter values are estimated (daily) through Bayesian inference on the basis of
surveillance data (i.e., reports of newly detected cases). The fixed parameter values are held
constant during inference; they are based on non-surveillance data and/or assumptions, which are
discussed in the section below. In this section, we simply delineate the parameters with
adjustable and fixed values. The compartmental model formulated for a given regional epidemic
has a total of 16 + 3(𝑛 + 1) parameters. The value of 𝑛 is structural; it sets the number socialdistancing periods considered.
The value of n corresponds to the number of periods of distinct social-distancing
behaviors that follow an initial period of social distancing, which we take to begin at time 𝑡 =
𝜎 > 𝑡" . Here, we take 𝑛 = 0 or 1 for all regional epidemics of interest. Initially, we set 𝑛 = 0. In
cases where we set 𝑛 = 1, this setting was motivated by second wave-type dynamics suggested
by the surveillance data, which we take to indicate a relaxation of social-distancing practices at
time 𝑡 = 𝜏' > 𝜎. The parameters of the initial social-distancing period are 𝜎, 𝑝" , and 𝜆" . The

parameters of the second social-distancing period, if considered, are 𝜏' , 𝑝' , and 𝜆' . Thus, there
are 3(𝑛 + 1) social-distancing parameters, all of which are taken to be adjustable.
In addition to the 3(𝑛 + 1) social-distancing parameters, we have 16 other parameters.
Three of these define the initial condition: 𝑡" , 𝑆! (𝑡 = 𝑡" ) = 𝑆" , and 𝐼! (𝑡 = 𝑡" ) = 𝐼" , where 𝑡" is
the time at which the epidemic begins, 𝑆" is taken to be the total population of the region of
interest, and 𝐼" (the initial number of infected individuals) is always taken to be 1 (an
assumption). We take 𝑡" to be adjustable and 𝑆" and 𝐼" to be fixed. The value of 𝑆" is set on the
basis of population estimates by the US Census Bureau for the metropolitan statistical areas of
interest (13), which are delineated by the US Office of Management and Budget (10).
There is only one more adjustable parameter of the compartmental model: 𝛽, which
characterizes the rate of disease transmission attributable to contacts among individuals within
the mixing population. In the period before the onset of social distancing, from 𝑡" to 𝜎, when
𝑆! /𝑆" ≈ 1, the instantaneous rate of disease transmission is 𝛽𝜙! (𝑡, 𝜌), where 𝜙! (𝑡, 𝜌) is the
effective number of infectious individuals at time 𝑡, a weighted sum of the numbers of
symptomatic, presymptomatic, and asymptomatic individuals determined by 𝜌 = (𝜌+ , 𝜌1 ). We
assume that exposed individuals after the first stage of disease incubation are infectious, as are
asymptomatic individuals in the immune clearance phase who have passed through all 5 stages
of disease incubation and who will never develop symptoms.
The remaining 12 parameters of the compartmental model, which are taken to have fixed,
region-independent values, are as follows: 𝑚# , 𝜌+ , 𝜌1 , 𝑘) , 𝑘/ , 𝑗/ , 𝑓1 , 𝑓4 , 𝑐1 , 𝑐3 , 𝑓5 and 𝑐4 . Our
estimates for these parameters are discussed in the section immediately below. It should be noted

characterize recovery/morbidity of hospitalized individuals. The parameter 𝑓5 is the fraction of
hospitalized individuals who recover, and the parameter 𝑐4 characterizes the hospital discharge
rate. Although nosocomial disease transmission is a significant concern, we assume that
hospitalized individuals are effectively quarantined such that the overall rate of disease
transmission in a given region is insensitive to the number of hospitalized individuals in that
region.
Estimates of 12 Fixed Parameter Values of the Compartmental Model
Here, in this section, we summarize the rationale/justification for each of our estimates
for the values of the following 12 parameters of the compartmental model: 𝑚# , 𝜌+ , 𝜌1 , 𝑘) , 𝑘/ ,
𝑗/ , 𝑓1 , 𝑓4 , 𝑐1 , 𝑐3 , 𝑓5 , and 𝑐4 . These estimates are assumed to apply to all regions, i.e., we take
these parameters to have region-independent values. The estimates given below should be
understood to be rough and provisional. The information available to inform these estimates is
limited. Although using point estimates for some of the model parameters can lead to
underestimates of parametric uncertainty (31), it is necessary to aggressively leverage prior
knowledge to reduce the number of adjustable parameters, because it is not feasible to infer all of
the model parameters from case reporting data. For each region of interest, we focus on inferring
model parameters that characterize when disease transmission started (𝑡" ), how disease
transmission depends on behavior (𝜎, 𝑝" , 𝜆" , and 𝛽), and surveillance (𝑓? and 𝑟). Given 1) the
data streams being analyzed, 2) the evident importance of behavior/social distancing on disease
transmission, and 3) our goal of situational awareness, it seems reasonable to focus on inference
of these parameters. (As we discuss below, we fix the value of 𝑚# , which characterizes social
distancing, only because we found it to be correlated with the value of 𝑝" , another socialdistancing parameter, when both are inferred.)

The parameter 𝑚# characterizes the effects of social distancing on disease transmission.
Without social distancing, all contacts responsible for disease transmission are between mixing
individuals (i.e., between individuals in the 𝐼! and 𝑆! pools) and the rate of transmission is
characterized by 𝛽. With social distancing, there are contacts involving 1 individual in a mixing
population and 1 individual in a protected population (e.g., between individuals in the 𝐼! and 𝑆$
pools or in the 𝑆! and 𝐼$ pools) and also contacts involving 2 individuals in protected
populations (e.g., between individuals in the 𝐼$ and 𝑆$ pools). In the model, the rates of
transmission associated with these types of contacts are characterized by 𝑚# 𝛽 and 𝑚#0 𝛽,
respectively. We can be confident that social distancing is protective (i.e., 𝑚# < 1) but there is
little information available to suggest the magnitude of the effect. We arbitrarily set 𝑚# = 0.1,
which can be interpreted to mean that a susceptible individual practicing social distancing has a
10-fold smaller chance of becoming infected than a susceptible individual that is not practicing
social distancing. In exploratory analyses, wherein we allowed 𝑚# to be a free parameter, we
found that its inferred value is positively correlated with the extent of social distancing, which is
determined by the relevant social-distancing setpoint parameter (for example, 𝑝" during the
initial social-distancing period). Thus, we interpret the inferred quasi-stationary value of 𝑆$ to be
an effective population size. If our estimate for 𝑚# is too high (i.e., we underestimate the
protective effect of social distancing), the effective size will be larger than the true size.
Conversely, if our estimate for 𝑚# is too low, the effective size will be smaller than the true size.
The parameters 𝜌+ and 𝜌1 characterize the relative infectiousness of individuals without
symptoms during the incubation period and the immune clearance phase, respectively.
Infectiousness is compared to that of a symptomatic individual. Using a one-step real-time
reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assay to quantify viral RNA

abundance in nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal samples, Arons et al. (14) determined rRT-PCR
threshold cycle (Ct) values for 17 symptomatic and 24 presymptomatic individuals. The former
group of individuals had typical symptoms, and the latter group of individuals lacked symptoms
at the time of testing but later developed symptoms (within 1 week after testing). At the time of
testing, the median Ct values for symptomatic and presymptomatic individuals were 24.8 and
23.1, respectively. (NB: Ct value is inversely proportional to abundance.) Based on these results
and an assumption that infectiousness is proportional to viral load, we estimate that 𝜌+ = 1.1. An
estimate for 𝜌+ greater than 1 is consistent with the findings of He et al. (32), who inferred that
viral load is maximal 0.7 d before the onset of symptoms from an analysis of temporal viral load
data and information available about infector-infectee transmission pairs. A review of the
literature by Benefield (33) indicates that viral load is maximal before onset of symptoms. Over a
period of 19 d, Nguyen et al. (15) performed daily rRT-PCR assays for viral RNA in
nasopharyngeal samples from 17 symptomatic and 13 asymptomatic individuals. Ngyuen et al.
(15) developed a curve-fitting model for each group to characterize their viral decay kinetics.
These models indicate that the mean Ct value for symptomatic individuals was roughly 90% of
the mean Ct value for asymptomatic individuals over the first week of the study, after which
most individuals tested negative or had a Ct value near the threshold of detection, 40. Thus, we
estimate that 𝜌1 = 0.9. Estimates of 𝜌+ and 𝜌1 should be considered crude.
The parameter 𝑘) characterizes the duration of the incubation period. In the model, the
incubation period is divided into 5 stages (for reasons explained shortly). The waiting time for
completion of all 5 stages is described by an Erlang distribution with a shape parameter 𝑘 = 5
and a scale parameter 𝜇 = 1/𝑘) . Lauer et al. (12) estimated times of exposure and symptom
onset for 181 confirmed cases and found that the median time between SARS-CoV-2 infection

and onset of COVID-19 symptoms is 5.1 d. Lauer et al. (12) also found that the empirical
distribution of waiting times is fit by an Erlang distribution with 𝑘 = 6 and 𝜇 = 0.88 d. This
latter finding suggests that the empirical waiting time distribution can be reproduced by dividing
the incubation period into 6 stages and setting 𝑘) = 1.14 d.' . However, an Erlang distribution
with 𝑘 = 5 and 𝜇 = 1.06 d has a nearly identical shape. Because simulation costs are reduced by
dividing the incubation period into 5 instead of 6 stages, we considered 5 stages in the model.
The distribution of waiting times estimated by Lauer et al. (12) is reproduced by our model when
we set 𝑘) = 0.94 d.' .
The parameters 𝑘/ and 𝑗/ characterize testing-driven quarantine and symptom-driven
self-isolation. We assume that testing is random. Thus, the number of infected individuals
moving into quarantine per d is the number of infected individuals subject to quarantine times
the fraction of the total population tested per d times a multiplier capturing the effect of contact
tracing. We take the multiplier to be average household size, 2.5 (US Census Bureau). Thus,
based on approximately 500,000 tests per d in the US (https://covidtracking.com/data/us-daily)
and a total population of 330 million (https://www.census.gov/popclock/), we estimate 𝑘/ =
0.0038 d.' . It should be understood that the 𝑘/ parameter, which characterizes the rate at which
exposed individuals move to quarantine because of testing and contact tracing, incorporates
factors such as false negative test results. As a simplification, we assume that 𝑘/ is the same for
each stage of disease progression. We assume 𝑗/ = 0.4 d.' . With this setting, the median
waiting time from onset of symptoms to initiation of self-isolation is approximately 40 h. A
faster timescale for self-isolation is probably not realistic despite general awareness of the
COVID-19 pandemic, because as considered in the study of Böhmer et al. (34), for any given

individual, there may be a prodromal phase of ~1 d marked by non-COVID-19-specific
symptoms other than fever and cough.
The parameter 𝑓1 is the fraction of infected individuals who never develop symptoms.
We estimate 𝑓1 on the basis of information about the COVID-19 outbreak on the Diamond
Princess cruise ship, as recounted by Sakurai et al. (17). See also Refs. (35) and (36). Before
disembarking, 3,618 passengers and crew members were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection. 410
of 712 individuals testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 were without symptoms at the time of
testing. The Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare of Japan (16) reported that 311 (76%) of
these individuals remained asymptomatic over the course of long-term follow-up. See also Refs.
9''

(35) and (36). Thus, we estimate that 𝑓1 = @'0 ≈ 0.44. This estimate is consistent with the results
of other studies. Lavezzo et al. (37) estimated that 43% of all infections are asymptomatic. In the
study of Gudbjartsson et al. (38), 7 of 13 individuals detected to have SARS-CoV-2 infection in
random-sample population screening did not report symptoms; 43% of all SARS-CoV-2-positive
participants in the study were symptom-free.
The parameter 𝑓4 is the fraction of symptomatic individuals progressing to severe
disease. We set 𝑓4 such that our model predicts a uniform infection fatality rate (IFR) consistent
with that determined by Perez-Saez et al. (18) from serological survey results and death
incidence reports: 0.0064 (~0.64%). For a discussion of other IFR estimates, which tend to be
similar, see Grewelle and De Leo (39). According to our model, IFR is given by (1 − 𝑓1 )𝑓4 (1 −
𝑓5 ). This quantity is the fraction of all infected individuals predicted to develop symptoms and
then to progress to severe disease (and hospitalization) and finally a fatal outcome. Thus, based

The parameter 𝑐1 characterizes the duration of infectiousness of asymptomatic
individuals in the immune response phase. For each of 89 asymptomatic individuals, Sakurai et
al. (17) reported the time between the first positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 and the first of
two serial negative PCR tests. The mean duration of this period was ~9.1 d. We assume that this
period coincides with the period of infectiousness and that this period encompasses both the
incubation period and the immune response phase. With the incubation period for both
presymptomatic and asymptomatic individuals divided into five stages of equal mean duration
1/𝑘) , the overall mean duration of the incubation period is 5/𝑘) . Based on our earlier estimate
that 𝑘) = 0.94 d.' , the mean duration of the incubation period is estimated as 5.3 d.
Accordingly, the mean duration of the immune clearance phase for asymptomatic individuals is
'

estimated as 9.1 d − 5.3 d = 3.8 d, and it follows that 𝑐1 = 9.E d ≈ 0.26 d.' .
If 𝑓4 ≪ 1, the parameter 𝑐3 characterizes the duration of infectiousness of individuals
who develop mild COVID-19 symptoms (i.e., symptoms not severe enough to require
hospitalization). Wölfel et al. (20) attempted to isolate live virus from clinical throat swab and
sputum samples collected from 9 patients at multiple time points after the onset of mild COVID19 symptoms. Roughly 67%, 38%, and 0% of attempts to isolate virus were successful at 6, 8,
and 10 d after infection, respectively. Assuming that a negative culture coincides with loss of
infectiousness, we estimate that 𝑐3 = −

do not affect the predicted transmission dynamics, because we assume that hospitalized patients
are effectively quarantined and do not contribute significantly to disease transmission, i.e., there
is no 𝐼4 term in 𝜙! or 𝜙$ (see Equations (18) and (19)). The parameter 𝑓5 is the fraction of
hospitalized patients who recover, and the parameter 𝑐4 characterizes the rate at which patients
are discharged (as either recovered or dead). Richardson et al. (19) reported that the overall
median length of hospital stay for 2,634 discharged patients (alive or dead) was 4.1 d. Thus, we

Likelihood Function Used in Inference of Model Parameter Values
We assume that the likelihood of a set of adjustable parameter values 𝜃K given a report of
𝛿𝐶- new cases on calendar date 𝒟- , which we will denote as ℒ- (𝜃K ; 𝛿𝐶- ), is given by the
following equation:

ℒ- (𝜃K ; 𝛿𝐶- ) = nbinom(𝛿𝐶- ; 𝑟, 𝑝- ) = '

𝛿𝐶- + 𝑟 − 1 L
( 𝑝- (1 − 𝑝- )MN!
𝛿𝐶- − 1

(25)

where 𝛿𝐶- is a non-negative integer (the number of new cases reported), 𝑖 is an integer indicating
the date 𝒟- or the period (𝑡- , 𝑡-<' ); nbinom(𝛿𝐶- ; 𝑟, 𝑝- ) is the probability mass function of the
negative binomial distribution NB(𝑟, 𝑝- ), which has two parameters, 𝑟 > 0 and 𝑝- ∈ [0,1]; and
𝜃K is a model-dependent ordered set of feasible (i.e., allowable) values for the adjustable model
parameters (e.g., 𝑁, 𝑡" , 𝑘, and 𝜃 in the case of the curve-fitting model) augmented with a feasible
value for 𝑟. Recall that 𝑡- ≡ 𝑡" + 𝑖 d, where 𝑡" > 0 is 0000 hours of 𝒟" , the start date of the local
epidemic. We take the dispersion parameter 𝑟 of NB(𝑟, 𝑝- ) to be date/time-independent (i.e.,

applicable to all surveillance days) and infer the value of 𝑟 jointly with the values of the model
parameters.
Recall the following modeling assumptions. We take surveillance testing to be a
stochastic process, i.e., we assume that the fraction of cases detected varies stochastically from
day to day. Furthermore, we take the deterministic compartmental model parameterized for a
given region to reproduce the mean daily outcomes of testing in that region. We also assume that
the randomness in the number of new cases detected on a given date 𝑡- is captured by a negative
binomial distribution NB(𝑟, 𝑝- ), where 𝑟 is a testing date-independent (i.e., 𝑡- -independent)
parameter and 𝑝- is a testing date-dependent (i.e., 𝑡- -dependent) parameter. The above
assumptions mean that, for each date 𝑡- , we are taking 𝐼(𝑡- , 𝑡-<' ), the predicted number of new
cases, to correspond to 𝔼[NB(𝑟, 𝑝- )], which equals 𝑟(1 − 𝑝- )/𝑝- . For this relationship to hold
true, each distributional parameter 𝑝- must satisfy the following constraint:
𝑝- =

𝑟
.
𝑟 + 𝐼(𝑡- , 𝑡-<' )

(26)

We use this constraint to determine the value of 𝑝- for all 𝑡- . Recall that the value of 𝑟 is jointly
inferred with the values of the adjustable compartmental model parameters.
If 𝑚 + 1 daily case reports are available, from date 𝒟" to date 𝒟O , we assume that each
likelihood ℒ- (𝜃K ; 𝛿𝐶- ) given by Equations (25) and (26) is independent. Thus, we have

𝛿𝐶- . Furthermore, recall that 𝜃K is defined as a model-dependent ordered set of feasible
adjustable model parameter values augmented with a feasible value for the likelihood function
parameter 𝑟. The identity of 𝜃K depends on whether we are using Equation (27) to make
inferences conditioned on the curve-fitting model or the compartmental model (i.e., we use
Equation (27) in both cases but the identity of 𝜃K depends on the model being considered). The
ordering of parameter values within the set 𝜃K is arbitrary but should be consistent.
When Equations (25)–(27) are used with the compartmental model having structure
defined by 𝑛 = 0, the elements of 𝜃K are 𝑡" , 𝜎, 𝑝" , 𝜆" , 𝛽, 𝑓? , and 𝑟, and 𝐼(𝑡- , 𝑡-<' ) is obtained
from Equation (24). When Equations (25)–(27) are used with the curve-fitting model (see
below), the elements of 𝜃K are 𝑁, 𝑡" , 𝑘, 𝜃, and 𝑟, and 𝐼(𝑡- , 𝑡-<' ) is obtained from Equation (31)
(see below).
Bayesian Inference and Online Learning
We chose the Bayesian inference framework to parametrize the models with uncertainty
quantification. In Bayesian inference, given a set of data 𝐷, the probability of each set of the
parameters, denoted in 𝜃K is constrained by the Bayes formula
ℙ{𝜃K |𝐷} =

ℙ{𝐷|𝜃K } ℙ{𝜃K }
.
∫Q ℙ{𝜃K ′|𝐷 } ℙ{𝜃K ′} d𝜃K ′

(28)

Here, the ℙ{𝜃K } is the prior parameter distribution, which represents our belief of how the model
parameters should distribute in the parameter space Ω, and ℙ{𝐷|𝜃K } is the likelihood of the
parameter set 𝜃K given the dataset 𝐷, that is, ℒ(𝜃K ; {𝛿𝐶- }O
-P" ) in Equation (27). In general,
evaluating the posterior parameter distribution ℙ{𝜃K |𝐷 } is a difficult computation, mainly
because of the high-dimensional integration of the term ∫Q ℙ{𝜃K ′|𝐷 } ℙ{𝜃K ′} d𝜃K ′, a term often

referred to as the evidence. Thus, for high-dimensional models, one relies on Markov chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques to sample the posterior parameter distribution ℙ{𝜃K |𝐷 }.
In contrast of many modeling analyses which focus on identifying the parameter
distributions, we are interested in projections of the models, whose parameters are inferred by
past data, into the future. To this end, we evaluate the model with a probabilistic parameter set
distributed by the obtained posterior distribution ℙ{𝜃K |𝐷}. Formally, we denote the prediction of
the confirmed cases between future day 𝑡- and 𝑡-<' by our deterministic model with a set of
parameters 𝜃K by 𝐼(𝑡- , 𝑡-<' ; 𝜃K ). Recall that this deterministic prediction represents the mean of
the fundamentally random new confirmed cases reported in a future interval (𝑡- , 𝑡-<' ). If there
was only parametric uncertainty which propagates through the deterministic model, the
confirmed cases reported in a future interval (𝑡- , 𝑡-<' ) would be distributed according to
∫Q 𝐼(𝑡- , 𝑡-<' ; 𝜃K ) ℙ{𝜃K |𝐷 } d𝜃K . However, there is also observation noise, which we model by a
negative binomial distribution. The observation noise also needs to be injected into the prediction
to quantify the full uncertainty. The full prediction accounting for parametric uncertainty is a
random variable distributed according to

𝑟S /(𝑟S + 𝐼(𝑡-<' , 𝑡- ; 𝜃KS )) where 𝑟S is the resampled 𝑟 which is also a free parameter in 𝜃KS and is
inferred in the MCMC. We repeat the resampling procedures and use the generated samples to
compute the percentile of the past history and future prediction.
Our aim is to perform the Bayesian inference daily as soon as a new regional confirmed
case number is reported. Although the Bayesian framework allows a sequential analysis, that the
previous derived posterior distribution is used as a prior and the new inference problem involves
only one new data point, in practice, such an analysis is difficult if the posterior distribution
cannot be emulated or interpolated from the discrete posterior chain. Our analysis shows that in
some regions, the posterior is far from Gaussian, making accurate interpolation or emulation
difficult. Thus, we are not adopting this workflow, and instead, we perform the inference with all
the data points collected up to the time of inference. Nevertheless, we warm-start the MCMC
chain from the maximum a posteriori estimator estimated from the previous derived chain, and
we also use the previously derived chain for estimating the optimal covariance matrix for the
proposal of the normal symmetric random-walk Metropolis sampler. This approach allows an
online learning of the optimal proposal which significantly reduces the mixing time.
Technical Details of Approach and Numerical Methods Used in Bayesian Inference
Because the variability of the data due to the regional and temporal differences, it is
difficult to identify a universal sampling strategy (the proposal kernel). Thus, we adopted an
adaptive Metropolis algorithm, specifically Algorithm 4 in Andrieu and Thoms (21) to
accommodate the regional and temporal differences.
For all the model parameters, we assume their priors are uniformly distributed. Denote
the 0:00 of the calendar date of the first confirmed case in a specific region by 𝑡T>UVW and the total

population of that region by 𝑆" . For the curve-fitting model, we assume the parameters are
bounded by 𝑁 ∈ (0, 𝑆" ), 𝑡" ∈ (𝑡T>UV, − 21, 𝑡T>UV, ), 𝜇 ∈ (0,10B ), 𝑘 ∈ (0,10B ), 𝜃 ∈ (0,10B ). For the
compartmental model with 𝑛 = 0, we assume that the parameters are bounded by 𝑡" ∈ (0, 𝑡 ⋆ ),
𝜎 ∈ (𝑡" , 𝑡 ⋆ − 𝑡" ), 𝛽 ∈ (0,10B ), 𝜆" ∈ (0,10), 𝑝" ∈ (0,1), and 𝑓? ∈ (0,1), where 𝑡 ⋆ is the time at
which inference is performed. We assume 𝑟 ∈ (0,10B ) for both models. The limits on parameter
values reflect feasibility constraints or bounds determined by trial-and-error so as to ensure that
the posterior mass is contained within the hypercube defined by the limits. We adopted rejectionbased sampling to assure the parameter values are sampled in the hypercube.
We start inference with an isotropic proposal kernel, that randomly perturbs the
parameter values by independent Gaussian proposals whose standard deviations are set to be 5%
of the parameter values. We carry out the standard Metropolis–Hastings algorithm for 5 × 10:
iterations first to identify local minimum. Then, we turned on the adaptive Metropolis algorithm
to calculate the covariance matrix on-the-fly, for another 5 × 10: iteration, when we turned on
an on-the-fly learning for optimal proposed increment, i.e., 𝜆 in Algorithm 4 of Andrieu and
Thoms (21). Because the weight for learning the proposed increment decays 1/iteration (21),
the proposed increment stabilizes after about 109 more iterations. We began to collect the
statistics from 1.5 × 102 iteration, until the simulation finishes at 6 × 102 iterations.
Except for the first time of the procedure (i.e., online learning and day-to-day operation),
we warm start the simulation from the previously obtained best-fit (maximum a posteriori
(MAP) estimator) and with the previously obtained covariance matrix and proposed increment.
We carry out standard Metropolis–Hastings algorithms for 2.5 × 10: iterations first to identify a
local minimum, noting that it is often not far away from the previously identified MAP. We then

turn on the adaptive MCMC algorithm to calculate the covariance matrix on-the-fly, again for
another 5 × 10: iteration. We then use another 2.5 × 10: iterations to calculate the optimal
proposed increment. We start to collect statistic from 102 iteration to 4 × 102 iteration when the
simulation finishes.
Model Selection
A heuristic model-selection procedure is used to select the most parsimonious value of n,
which determines the structure of the compartmental model (i.e., the number of social distancing
periods considered) and the number of adjustable parameters describing social distancing (three
for each social-distancing period). The procedure for deciding between 𝑛 = 0 and 𝑛 = 1 is as
follows. We calculate Aikake information criterion (AIC) (40) values for the 𝑛 = 0 and 𝑛 = 1
versions of the compartmental model. Similarly, we calculate Bayesian information criterion
(BIC) (40) values for the two versions of the model. We define ΔAIC as AIC ;P" − AIC ;P' and
ΔBIC as BIC ;P" − BIC ;P' , where AIC ;P" (AIC ;P' ) is the AIC value calculated for the 𝑛 = 0
(𝑛 = 1) version of the compartmental model and, similarly, BIC ;P" (BIC ;P' ) is the BIC value
calculated for the 𝑛 = 0 (𝑛 = 1) version of the compartmental model. The recommendations of
Burnham and Anderson (40) indicate that we can interpret ΔAIC>10 to mean that the evidence
strongly supports the 𝑛 = 1 version of the model. In other words, we are justified in using 𝑛 =
1 (the more complex version of the model) instead of 𝑛 = 0 when ΔAIC>10. However, we take
a more conservative approach. We adopt 𝑛 = 1 over 𝑛 = 0 only when both ΔAIC>10 and
ΔBIC>10. We are using the same approach described above to decide between 𝑛 = 1 and 𝑛 = 2.

Daily predictions based on region-specific parameterizations of the compartmental model
are being archived at a GitHub repository (https://github.com/lanl/COVID-19-Predictions). It
should be noted that the model’s structural parameter n—which determines the number of
distinct social-distancing periods considered in the model—varies from region to region and can
change over time.
Forecasting Accuracy
We performed out-of-sample testing of forecasting accuracy for inferences conditioned
on the compartmental model with the value of 𝑛 chosen through model selection. For predictions
1, 4, and 7 days ahead, we determined the empirical coverage, meaning the frequencies
characterizing how often the empirical data fell below predicted quantiles. In this analysis, we
considered surveillance data available between 14-July-2020 and 9-September-2020 (inclusive
dates). The results obtained using the combined out-of-sample data and predictions for all 15
MSAs of interest are shown in Appendix Figure 5. As can be seen, overall, predictions are
(weakly) biased toward underprediction of new case detection.
Evaluation of a Stochastic Version of the Compartmental Model
A compartmental model may be formulated as either a deterministic model or a
stochastic model. Use of a deterministic model is a potential liability, because there are situations
where the assumptions of a deterministic model break down, necessitating use of a stochastic
model. For this reason, we performed an analysis to determine which of the two model types
(deterministic or stochastic) is better suited for analysis of the data of interest here.
We constructed an individual-based continuous-time Markov chain with consideration of
the same processes as those in our deterministic compartmental model. The intrinsic stochasticity

arises from the discreteness of populations. We followed the standard procedure to construct a
set of stochastic differential equations (SDEs), by first formulating a master equation, then
performing the Kramers-Moyal expansion to obtain the approximate continuum-limit FokkerPlanck equation in the large-population limit, and formulating the corresponding SDEs. The
procedure has been described, for example, by Lin et al. (41, 42).
In simulations, we used the Euler-Maruyama integrator to evolve the SDEs with a time
step of 0.05 (d). We checked to make sure the timestep was sufficiently small.
We adopted a standard particle filter technique to identify the Maximum Likelihood
Estimator of the parameters of the stochastic model, noting that our process is not timehomogeneous due to different episodes of distinct social-distancing practices. We used the data
from the New York City and Miami MSAs from 21-Jan-2020 to 29-Aug-2020 to parametrize the
stochastic model.
After identifying the point estimator, the predicted quantiles were calculated similarly as
for the deterministic model. Finally, we quantified the in-sample empirical coverage, i.e., the
empirical frequencies quantifying when training-data points fall below the predicted quantiles.
When the noise model is correct, one would expect that such frequencies should coincide with
the prediction.
For the New York City MSA, we obtained the results shown in Appendix Figure 6. For
the Miami MSA, we obtained the results shown in Appendix Figure 7. By visually inspecting the
predictive posteriors, we can see that the stochastic models lead to higher uncertainty than the
deterministic models for New York City and Miami. The right-most panels, the in-sample
calibration curves, show that the SDE model in both cases is farther away from the diagonal than

the deterministic model. These results indicate that the stochastic models assert more uncertainty
than the data distribution. Thus, it seems more appropriate to use a deterministic version of the
model for forecasting than a stochastic version, at least at this time.
Evaluation of a Curve-Fitting Model
Various fitting functions, or curve-fitting models, have been used to reproduce COVID19 incidence data and to make forecasts of new cases (43–50). We decided to evaluate this
approach using the fitting function described below, which is a discretized convolution of two
integrals. This approach is related to an approach used to analyze acquired immunodeficiency
syndrome (AIDS) data (51, 52). Use of a curve-fitting model has the advantage of not requiring
insights into disease transmission mechanisms, which may be particularly advantageous during
outbreaks of new/emerging diseases. A drawback of a curve-fitting model is that it may be
limited in its ability to reproduce empirical epidemic curves. We considered a fitting function
that is able to generate an asymmetric curve (Appendix Figure 8), i.e., an epidemic curve with
two timescales, as when there is fast growth and slow decay in new daily cases. Like many such
models used in epidemiology, the curve-fitting model considered here can only generate singlepeaked curves. Because the MSAs of interest have experienced multiple-wave diseasetransmission dynamics (i.e., >1 period of increasing disease incidence), we are no longer using
the curve-fitting model in forecasting. We present the curve-fitting model and results obtained
with it to illustrate how a curve-fitting model can be combined with Bayesian inference to
generate forecasts with uncertainty quantification.
For each metropolitan statistical area (MSA) of interest, we assume that there is an
infection curve 𝑄(𝑡) describing the number of individuals who become infected at time 𝑡 with

SARS-CoV-2 and who will later be detected in local COVID-19 surveillance efforts.
Furthermore, we assume that this curve has a shape that can be generated/reproduced by
𝜌Y (𝑡, 𝑘, 𝜃), the probability density function (PDF) of a gamma distribution Γ(𝑘, 𝜃). In other
words, we assume that 𝑄(𝑡) = 𝑁𝜌Y (𝑡, 𝑘, 𝜃), where 𝑁 is a scaling factor that we can identify as
the number of individuals who will be detected over the entire course of the local epidemic. The
shape of a gamma distribution is flexible and determined by the values of its two parameters: 𝑘,
which is called the shape parameter, and 𝜃, which is called the scale parameter. The functional
form that we assume for 𝑄(𝑡) allows the curve-fitting model to reproduce the shape of an
epidemic curve having two timescales. Early in the pandemic, many empirical COVID-19
epidemic curves appeared to have two timescales: an initial period during which new case
reports increase relatively quickly from day to day followed by a period during which new case
reports decrease relatively slowly from day to day.
We do not take the infection curve 𝑄(𝑡) to correspond directly to the number of new
COVID-19 cases reported on the date encompassing time 𝑡, because only symptomatic
individuals are likely to be detected in COVID-19 surveillance testing (to a first approximation).
This situation complicates our model as there is known to be a potentially lengthy, variable delay
in the onset of symptoms after infection (12). We assume that the waiting time 𝜏 − 𝑡 for the
onset of COVID-19 symptoms after SARS-CoV-2 infection at time 𝑡 is distributed according to
a log-normal distribution. Let us use 𝜌)R (𝜏 − 𝑡; 𝜇)R , 𝜎)R ) to denote the PDF of the waiting-time
distribution modeled by a log-normal distribution with parameters 𝜇)R and 𝜎)R set to the values
estimated by Lauer et al. (12). Let us use 𝐼(𝑡- , 𝑡-<' ) to denote the predicted number of new
COVID-19 cases reported within a period beginning at time 𝑡- ≡ 𝑡" + 𝑖 d and ending at time
𝑡-<' , where 𝑡" > 0 is the start time of the local epidemic. We assume that surveillance testing for

SARS-CoV-2 infection starts prior to time 𝑡" , and we take time 𝑡 = 0 to correspond to 0000
hours on 21-January-2020, the date on which detection of the first US COVID-19 case was
widely reported (3). Under the aforementioned assumptions, 𝐼(𝑡- , 𝑡-<' ) is given by a convolution
of integral functions. Namely, 𝐼(𝑡- , 𝑡-<' ) is given by the following expression:

𝐼(𝑡- , 𝑡-<' ) = 𝑁 „

It should be noted that 𝑠 in this expression is a dummy variable of integration. Equation (30) is a
special case of the general model proposed by Brookmeyer and Gail (51) for predicting future
AIDS cases.
Equation (30) can be evaluated through numerical quadrature, but this procedure is
computationally expensive. To overcome this limitation, we replace the double integral in
Equation (30) with a sum, and we calculate 𝐼(𝑡- , 𝑡-<' ) using the following expression instead of
Equation (30):
-

𝐼(𝑡- , 𝑡-<' ) = 𝐾" 𝑄- + 𝐾' 𝑄-.' + ⋯ + 𝐾-.' 𝑄' + 𝐾- 𝑄" = ’ 𝐾-.Z 𝑄Z

In Equation (31), the 𝐾-.Z terms are weighting functions (i.e., kernels) that account for the
variable duration of the incubation period, and the 𝑄Z terms represent cumulative numbers of
new detectable infections occurring over discrete 1-d periods. In Equation (32), each 𝐹)R term
denotes a cumulative distribution function (CDF) of a log-normal distribution, and in Equation
(33), each 𝐹Y term denotes a CDF of a gamma distribution. In other words, 𝑄Z is the cumulative
number of individuals infected in the period (𝑡Z , 𝑡Z<' ) who will eventually be detected, and 𝐾-.Z
is the probability that one of these individuals becomes symptomatic and is detected in the period
(𝑡- , 𝑡-<' ), where 𝑡- ≥ 𝑡Z .
The functional form of our curve-fitting model is defined by Equations (31)–(33), which
are derived from Equation (30). As can be seen by inspecting Equation (30), the curve-fitting
model has six parameters: 𝑁, 𝑡" (which is hidden in the definition of 𝑡- ), 𝑘, 𝜃, 𝜇)R , and 𝜎)R . As
noted earlier, estimates are available for 𝜇)R and 𝜎)R from Lauer et al. (12). These parameters
characterize the variable duration of the incubation period, which starts at infection and ends at
the onset of symptoms. Thus, we take 𝜇)R and 𝜎)R to have fixed region-independent values. We
take the remaining parameters—𝑁 (a population size/scaling factor), 𝑡" (the start time of the
local epidemic), and 𝑘 and 𝜃 (the parameters that determine the shape of the infection curve
𝑄(𝑡))—to have adjustable region-specific values. In our daily inferences, we consider one
additional region-specific adjustable parameter, the dispersal parameter of the likelihood
function (see Equation (27) above). The value of this parameter, 𝑟, is inferred jointly with the
values of 𝑁, 𝑡" , 𝑘, and 𝜃.

For the period from January to June, 2020, for each of the 15 MSAs of interest, we
parameterized on a daily basis a curve-fitting model for consistency with all daily reports of new
confirmed cases available at the time. The methodology used was the same as that used for
inferences conditioned on the compartmental model unless otherwise noted. For each MSA, the
curve-fitting model was taken to have four adjustable parameters (Appendix Table 2): 𝑁, the
total number of infected individuals who will be detected over the entire course of the local
epidemic; 𝑡" , the start time of the local epidemic; and 𝑘 and 𝜃, the shape and scale parameters of
a gamma (Γ) distribution. Inference of adjustable parameter values is based on a negative
binomial likelihood function, which is given by Equation (27). The dispersal parameter 𝑟 of the
likelihood was taken to be adjustable; its value was jointly inferred with those of 𝑁, 𝑡" , 𝑘, and 𝜃.
Inferences are conditioned on fixed parameter estimates for 𝜇)R and 𝜎)R (Appendix Table 2).
These parameters, the mean and standard deviation of a log-normal distribution, characterize the
incubation period (i.e., the waiting time from infection to onset of symptoms) (12). For any given
(1-day) surveillance period and specified settings for parameter values, a prediction of the curvefitting model for expected new cases detected was generated by evaluating the sum in Equation
(31). A prediction of the actual number of new cases detected was obtained by entering the
predicted expected number of new cases (according to either the curve-fitting or compartmental
model) into Equation (29).
Predictive inferences conditioned on the curve-fitting model for all 15 MSAs of interest
conditioned are shown in Appendix Figure 9. These results demonstrate that, for the timeframe
of interest, the curve-fitting model was capable of reproducing many but not all of the MSAspecific empirical epidemic curves. The limitations of curve fitting can be seen by examining
predictions for the Atlanta MSA, where there is high variability in the daily number of new cases

detected. Although there is no clear downward trend in the data, the curve-fitting model
nevertheless predicts a peak in late-April/early-May and a downward trend thereafter. This
prediction is obtained because the model, by design, is only capable of generating single-peaked
epidemic curves that rise and then fall.
