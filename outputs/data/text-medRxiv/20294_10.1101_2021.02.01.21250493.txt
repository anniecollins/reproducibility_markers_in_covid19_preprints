The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory
syndrome-related coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has now caused over 2 million deaths
worldwide and continues to expand. Currently, much is unknown about functionally neutralizing
human antibody responses and durability to SARS-CoV-2. Using convalescent sera collected
from 101 COVID-19 recovered individuals 21-212 days after symptom onset with forty-eight
additional longitudinal samples, we measured functionality and durability of serum antibodies.
We also evaluated associations between individual demographic and clinical parameters with
functional neutralizing antibody responses to COVID-19. We found robust antibody durability out
to six months, as well as significant positive associations with the magnitude of the neutralizing
antibody response and male sex. We also show that SARS-CoV-2 convalescent neutralizing
antibodies are higher in individuals with cardio-metabolic comorbidities.

Significance: In this study we found that neutralizing antibody responses in COVID-19
convalescent individuals vary in magnitude but are durable and correlate well with RBD Ig
binding antibody levels compared to other SARS-CoV-2 antigen responses. In our cohort,
higher neutralizing antibody titers are independently and significantly associated with male sex
compared to female sex. We also show for the first time, that higher convalescent antibody titers
in male donors are associated with increased age and symptom grade. Furthermore, cardiometabolic co-morbidities are associated with higher antibody titers independently of sex. Here,
we present an in-depth evaluation of serologic, demographic, and clinical correlates of
functional antibody responses and durability to SARS-CoV-2.

Over twelve months have passed since the emergence and eventual global spread of the novel
coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, the agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. As SARS-CoV-2 continues to
spread and mutate across naïve and previously exposed populations, increased understanding
of the breadth and durability of individual humoral responses to natural infection is needed to
assess the re-infection risk of individuals and also to guide the deployment and to inform
recently authorized vaccines and antibody-based therapies. Recent work has shown that SARSCoV-2 can stimulate the production of highly neutralizing antibodies directed against the spike
protein (S) which is necessary for viral attachment, fusion and entry into host cells(1, 2). We and
others have shown that antibodies directed against the ACE2 receptor binding domain (RBD) of
the S protein consistently demonstrate a strong correlation with functional neutralization (3-5),
and are protective in non-human primate and rodent models (6-9). Furthermore, low
conservation between the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 and other non-SARS human
betacoronaviruses, makes RBD an appealing target for highly specific COVID-19 responses.

Serum antibody responses to endemic betacoronaviruses initially wane weeks to months after
infection, but remain detectable up to at least 1 year (10, 11). After SARS-CoV-1 and MERS
infections, IgG levels peak at four months, then slowly wane but remain detectable for at least
two years and up to 17 years (11, 12). Although antibody seroconversion to primary SARS-CoV2 infection is nearly universal within the first two weeks after symptom onset (4, 13-15), the
magnitude of this response varies with symptom severity (4, 16, 17). Longevity of serum
antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 S protein after vaccination as well as natural infection has been
studied out to three months, during which time IgG, IgM and IgA levels to most SARS-CoV-2
antigens peak and begin to decline (16, 18-20), as plasmablast and short-lived plasma cell
responses wane. More recent data suggests that S protein IgG levels begin to reach a steady
level with much slower rates of decline after 90 days post infection (5, 21, 22). Few studies have
described long-term durability of SARS-CoV-2 wild-type (WT) virus neutralizing antibodies in
recovered individuals, and the protective titer of these antibodies is unknown.

The clinical and demographic determinants of the breadth and durability of functionally
neutralizing antibodies, have not been studied in-depth after SARS-CoV-2 infection. A recent
study found higher ratios of RBD antibodies to nucleocapsid (N) antibodies in outpatient
compared to inpatient populations (4). Another study found positive correlations with RBD and
neutralizing antibody levels with male sex, age and symptom severity in a mild disease cohort
60 days post symptom onset (23). Finally, studies have suggested that there is a faster decline
in S antibody levels acutely after infection in asymptomatic individuals, compared to
symptomatic individuals (4, 17). These early findings in binding and neutralizing antibody levels
within the first 30-60 days post infection, indicate that there are significant demographic and
clinical differences in humoral immune responses to COVID-19 infection. Identifying these
differences is critical to understanding long term protection from natural infection as well as
vaccine-induced immunity. In this study, we use both novel and established assays to
characterize the binding and longevity of serum antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 RBD, spike protein
N-terminal domain (NTD) and N antigens, and to measure the level and durability of SARSCoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. We further define demographic and clinical correlates of the
magnitude and durability of both binding and functional antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2.

Between April 11th and July 22nd 2020, a total of 101 eligible COVID-19 convalescent plasma
(CP) donors were enrolled in this study. The majority of donors donated once, however 31
donors provided sequential donations amounting in an additional 48 serum samples. Donors
were over 18 years of age, 51% male and 49% female (based on sex assigned at birth). The
median age was 43 years (Interquartile Range 29, full range 18-79), which is similar to other CP
donor cohorts (22, 23) and the majority identified as non-Hispanic, white/Caucasian. Donors
were diagnosed with COVID-19 by either SARS-CoV-2 reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) (n = 79) or blood antibody testing by EUA approved commercial assays (n =
22) (Table 1 & Supplementary Table 1). Donors diagnosed by antibody test had either RT-PCRconfirmed household contacts, COVID-19 symptoms without RT-PCR testing, or unable to
provide a copy of their RT-PCR result. The median time from symptom onset or RT-PCR
diagnosis to first donation was 57 days (full range 21-121). Thirty-four donors reported comorbid
conditions, the most common being hay fever and high blood pressure (Supplementary Table
2). Eight donors were asymptomatic and 93 reported symptoms. The median time of symptom
duration for symptomatic donors without ongoing symptoms (72/90) was 16 days (full range 2107). Fifty-seven donors had mild-to-moderate disease (Grade 1-2; outpatient), 14 donors had
severe disease (Grade 3-4; hospitalized), and 22 donors had unknown disease severity (Table
1). The most common symptoms reported were fatigue (89%), headache (77%), fever (74%)
and muscle aches (73%) (Supplementary Table 3). The majority of donors resided in central
North Carolina, with the highest proportion from Orange and Wake counties (Supplementary
Fig. 1).

To investigate in-depth functional antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection at
convalescence, we employed two virus neutralization assays, one using an authentic WT
SARS-CoV-2 with a luciferase reporter(24), and another using a PSV assay (see Methods). We
also measured total Ig binding to the spike protein RBD and NTD, as well as IgG binding to N
protein antigen. We found that 98% (99/101) of donors generated antibodies to at least one
SARS-CoV-2 antigen or virus (Fig. 1a,b), 92% (93/101) had at least two positive antibody
assays, and 65% (65/101) had functional and binding antibodies to all viruses and antigens.
Only two donors had negative results in every assay, both were asymptomatic and both
diagnosed by an antibody test. We found that the most sensitive assays to detect antibodies in
recovered donors were the RBD total Ig assay (96% of donors positive), followed by PSV
neutralization and N IgG assays (both 93% of donors positive).

All donors with undetectable RBD antibody titers also had undetectable neutralizing antibody
assays, and the RBD binding assay showed the strongest correlation with the two neutralization
assays (Fig. 1c-f, Supplementary Fig. 2). Among the other binding assays, the N assay had the
weakest correlations with both neutralization assays compared to the spike antigen based NTD
assay. We then looked at quantitative measures of functionally neutralizing as well as RBDbinding antibody levels by end-point titer. The majority of donors (80%) had detectable WT
neutralizing antibody titers, and > 50% of these exceeded 1:160 (the FDA-recommended
threshold for therapeutic applications of convalescent plasma) (Supplementary Fig. 3). The
majority of RBD total Ig end-point titers were found to be within the range of 1:160-1:640. Since

isotype specific IgA and to a lesser extent, IgM antibodies may influence the early neutralizing
antibody response (25), we also measured RBD IgA and IgM binding titers. Approximately 60%
of donors demonstrated detectable IgA or IgM antibodies to RBD, with most in the lower titer
range (1:20-1:159) (Supplementary Fig. 3).

Overall donor antibody levels, including additional donations from 31/101 donors who donated
more than once (total samples donated n=149), revealed stable neutralizing, RBD, and NTDbinding antibodies over six months (Fig. 2). Among the specific assays, neutralizing antibodies
to WT virus and binding antibodies to NTD were the most stable out to 180 days (Fig. 2a,b).
Through 120 days and beyond, there was a slight decrease in PSV neutralizing antibodies and
total Ig binding antibodies to RBD (Fig. 2c,d). RBD total Ig decreases over time were likely due
in part to the decline of IgA and IgM titers that we observed after day 90 (Fig. 2e,f). Notably,
compared with antibodies directed against spike protein antigens, there was a stronger
decrease in N binding IgG levels over this time period (Fig. 2g). When comparing the correlation
coefficients of the trendlines in Fig. 2a-d,g with a Fisher r-to-z transformation, we found
significant (p < 0.05) differences only between NTD antibody levels compared to all of the other
assays which either stay constant or decrease.

We then studied in detail the donors who provided sequential donations to examine temporal
kinetics of antibody levels at an individual level. Overall functional neutralizing antibody levels to
WT virus and RBD-binding Ig levels showed no significant changes between donation times
(Fig. 3a,b and Supplementary Fig. 4). To ascertain if initial antibody titer plays a role in antibody
changes over time, we separated sequential donors into three groups by initial titer: > 1:640,
1:160-1:640, and 1:20-1:159. Median WT viral neutralization antibody titers (Fig. 3c-e) and RDB
Ig antibody titers (Fig. 3f-h) between the first two donations showed a modest decrease in the
highest initial titer group (>1:640), but not in the lower titer groups. However, earlier time points
are needed in the lower titer groups to better compare these levels to the high titer group, as we
may not see changes in the lower titer groups due to longer time to first donation in these
groups. This decrease in the RBD total Ig group with initial titer > 1:640 was likely due to RBD
IgA and IgM levels in these donors, which showed a significant decline between the first two
donations (p < 0.05) (data not shown).

SARS-CoV-2 binding and functionally neutralizing antibody levels were higher in males
compared to females (Fig. 4a,b, Supplementary Fig. 5), and increased with increasing age and
correlate positively with male age and symptom grade (Fig. 4c,d). This difference between
males and females (Fig. 4a,b) remained after negative data points were removed from each
analysis. Surprisingly, positive correlations with antibody levels and age and symptom grade
(Fig. 4c,d, Extended Data Fig. 4) were restricted to the male population (Fig. 4e,f). Sex
stratification revealed that in males, age and symptom grade were significantly positively
correlated, as were age and RBD Ig and functionally neutralizing antibody levels (Fig. 4e,g-k).
On the other hand, in females, only RBD IgA levels were associated with symptom grade (Fig.
4f). Males and females were equally likely to be hospitalized (p = 0.95).

We then examined the possibility that antibody stability over time was influenced by sex or age.
No significant differences were observed in WT neutralizing antibody levels or RBD Ig levels
over time (first 90 days) between males and females (Fig. 5a,b). In contrast, there were rapid
declines in both types of antibodies in the youngest age group (18-43yo) over the first 90-day
period (Fig. 5c,d) that may have been related to decreases in serum RBD IgA, but not IgM,
which showed a significant decline in this age group over this time period (Fig. 5e). We then
calculated an estimate of the effect of age, adjusted for time from symptom onset to donation,
stratified by sex on the various functional and binding antibody levels. Among males we
observed that for each one year increase in age there was a significant increase in antibody
levels in all assays tested except N IgG and RBD IgM, but among females age did not seem to
affect antibody levels after accounting for time from symptom onset (Fig. 5f).

Since we identified that in male donors, increased symptom grade, or disease severity
correlated with higher antibody levels, we looked more closely at individual symptoms to
ascertain if any in particular were associated with each other, or with donor serum antibody
levels. We found that of the most common symptoms, only loss of sense of taste and smell
were associated, though more strongly in female than male donors (Supplementary Fig. 7a, b).
Surprisingly, we found a negative effect of reporting tiredness or fatigue in male donors on the
level of RBD Ig binding antibodies (Supplementary Fig. 7b). We also evaluated the association
between antibody levels and the presence of comorbid conditions and found that donors with
cardio-metabolic diseases had higher levels of neutralizing, RBD Ig, N IgG and NTD Ig
antibodies. This observation was independent of sex. Symptom duration (Supplementary Fig.
5k-q,4), nulliparity and ABO blood group were not significantly associated with functional or
binding antibody levels.

In-depth serological, clinical and demographic correlates of durable and protective functional
antibodies in individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 have not been well described.
Understanding serological responses to COVID-19 disease and vaccination, will allow us to
define which antibody populations may be protective against reinfection and thus act as
immunological correlates of protection. Of 101 convalescent plasma donors who experienced a
range of COVID-19 disease, the vast majority have detectable levels of functionally neutralizing
as well as binding antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 RBD, NTD and N antigens. Furthermore, though
their titers are heterogeneous, most donors have neutralizing and RBD-targeting antibody titers
of >1:160. Even low levels of functionally neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, as seen here
in about a quarter of donors, are protective in non-human primate vaccine models (26, 27). This
suggests that low serum levels of a few highly potent antibodies may be enough to confer
protection, and we find that such antibodies are nearly universally produced upon exposure to
the virus in this donor cohort of mostly symptomatic cases.

Of three SARS-CoV-2 antigens used for antibody detection in this study, the RBD was the most
sensitive in detecting prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, RBD total Ig levels showed the
strongest correlation with functionally neutralizing antibodies, suggesting its role as the
immunodominant antigenic target of antibodies that neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found
that 95% of sera with an RBD total Ig titer of ≥1:160 had positive WT virus neutralizing antibody
titers, suggesting that this may be a cutoff used as a surrogate for functional antibody assays.
Furthermore, the majority of donors with undetectable WT virus neutralizing antibody levels, had

detectable RBD-binding antibodies, suggesting they may have RBD-targeting neutralizing
antibodies that are below the assay detection limit. This hypothesis can be tested in future
studies using passive transfer mouse protection models. This highlights the potential role for
RBD-based antibody assay development and testing as a surrogate for functional antibody
assays that could be deployed in the clinical and vaccination setting in a scalable, highthroughput fashion.

The strongest demographic correlate of neutralizing antibody levels we found was male sex.
Studies have shown that COVID-19 disease is associated with higher morbidity and mortality
rates in men compared with women (28). The reason for this finding is unknown, and seems
unrelated to CD8+ and CD4+ T cell frequency (22). Sex differences in other respiratory viral
disease outbreaks have been seen, for example during the 2009 influenza pandemic where
female sex correlated with severe disease in a young cohort in Canada(29). Some viral
infections as well as vaccinations such as the influenza vaccination have been seen to elicit
stronger serum antibody and cellular immune responses in females(30), while others elicit
stronger serologic antibody responses in males(31). Differences in disease severity and
humoral responses to vaccines have been hypothesized to be influenced by a combination of
sex hormone effects on immune cell signaling, X chromosome immune-related gene expression
and miRNA levels, and genetic polymorphisms (30) in genes encoding important immunologic
proteins such as IL-6 (32) and CTLA-4 (33).

Robbiani et al. reported significantly higher SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibodies and functionally
neutralizing antibodies in male compared to female COVID-19 CP donors with mild-moderate
disease in the first 60 days post symptom onset (23). Similarly, we find significant correlations of
higher functional and binding antibody levels with male sex, continued out to 180 days. We
further add that these sex differences in antibody levels are also seen with SARS-CoV-2 N
protein and NTD antigens, and that age and symptom grade also influenced the sex disparity in
RBD binding and functionally neutralizing antibody responses. These findings suggest that male
sex, especially males with increased age and worse COVID-19 symptom severity may be a
demographic and clinical correlate of functional antibodies. Studies have shown that early
convalescent functional antibody levels are higher in individuals with more severe COVID19(16, 19), which may be a product of prolonged viral replication and immune antigenic
exposure. Our findings recognize that there are currently unknown underlying factors which
predispose older males to either prolonged viral replication and immune exposure to SARSCoV-2, or differential immune activation.

We do not yet know what level of functional antibodies is required for protection from SARSCoV-2. Although female donors in this cohort have lower antibody levels than males, this may
be enough to confer long-term protection. This observation warrants further investigation,
including consideration of a similar sex-bias in vaccine-induced immunity. Furthermore, we
found significant differences in sex and functional antibody production despite reported disease
severity, suggesting that pro-longed viremia and/or abnormal cytokine activation may not be the
only things responsible for this finding. Other hypotheses that have been made to explain
COVID-19 disease sex differences include poorer T cell responses in males (28), and the
presence of previously undetected auto-antibodies against Type I interferons (34) in males with
severe disease. On the other hand, the hypothesis that expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS,
important SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry receptors in human lung and other tissues, play a role in
the sex disparity is thought to be an unlikely explanation (35).

In the face of COVID-19 vaccinations and new viral mutations, it is critical to define functional
antibody durability after natural infection and vaccination. Here we show for the first time, that
functionally neutralizing antibodies to WT SARS-CoV-2 virus remain stable months post
symptom onset, and that this is likely maintained to 180 days. Not surprisingly, levels of RBDbinding IgA and IgM antibodies declined rapidly within the first three months after symptom
onset. However, NTD-binding Ig antibodies remain stable, and RBD-binding Ig antibodies
declined modestly. Levels of WT neutralizing and RBD Ig antibodies on an individual level were
also maintained, with only a modest decrease within the first 90 days after symptom onset in
donors with initial titers > 1:640. When broken down by age group, 18-34 year old donors
demonstrated a significant decrease in functional antibody and RBD Ig responses over the first
90 days post symptom onset that was likely driven by rapidly declining RBD IgA levels.

We also find that N IgG antibodies correlate least with neutralizing antibodies and continue to
decline 120-180 days post symptom onset, a trend which was noted 90 days post symptomonset in a mild-disease community cohort (18). This suggests that though SARS-CoV-2 N
antibodies may be generated at high levels early after symptomatic infection, N may not be an
immunodominant target of the adaptive immune response, and thus is a less sensitive measure
of remote infection. This further suggests that the use of N protein in seroprevalence studies
may bias results towards more recent infections and warrants further investigation in cohorts of
mild and asymptomatic COVID-19 disease.

One major limitation of this study is the demographic uniformity of our study population, which
limits the generalizability of our findings and highlights the need to do these studies with a more
diverse and representative population. Another bias in our donor population is our focus on recalling donors with higher neutralizing antibody titers to repeat donations. Thus, our “sequential
donation” population is biased towards higher titer donors.

Understanding human antibody responses and correlates of neutralizing antibodies to SARSCoV-2 is critical in the next coming phase of understanding SARS-CoV-2 vaccine efficacy and
protection against reinfection. We find that WT SARS-CoV-2 functionally neutralizing antibodies
are maintained for months after infection. Our findings further support the role of RBD binding
antibodies as correlates of functionally neutralizing antibodies, suggesting that vaccines that
induce potent RBD responses may be particularly efficacious. Furthermore, we identify for the
first time, a role for sex differences as sustained correlates of WT SARS-CoV-2 functional
neutralization. The association of male sex in this cohort with higher neutralizing antibody levels
reveals a sexual dimorphism in humoral immune responses to SARS-CoV-2. We hypothesize
that this is likely due to a combination of factors such as differences in duration of mucosal
replication, T cell responses, sex hormone roles in immune activation, and genetic differences in
immune responses. This finding may have clinical as well as vaccine outcome implications, and
warrants further investigation.

Convalescent plasma was obtained from volunteer donors who met FDA criteria for plasma
collections in the UNC Blood Donor Center. Donors were recruited via IRB-approved direct
contact of SARS-CoV-2 positive persons diagnosed through the hospital laboratory system, and
public solicitation through multi-media outlets. Fresh sera and plasma collected in the diversion
pouch as part of the standard plasmapheresis procedure was saved for research from donors
consented to study participation. All donors had confirmed COVID-19 infection by blood
antibody testing or nasopharyngeal swab indicating the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA as
performed by RT-PCR in a US laboratory with a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments
certification. All donors were recovered from their COVID-19 illness and qualified for collection
in adherence with FDA-regulatory guidance. As required at the time, some donors had a
negative repeat SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test done within 72 hours prior to donation. At the time of
plasma collection, donors were offered participation in the study. All donors who participated
provided written informed consent. The research was approved by the UNC Institutional Review
Board, and conducted under good clinical research practices. Participating donor characteristics
and information regarding COVID-19 symptoms and history were obtained through in-person
and telephone interviews using a standardized questionnaire as part of UNC IRB #20-1141. We
generated a 4-point symptom severity scale for this study based on the DAIDS grading
system(36). For this study time period we did not pre-screen donors to determine presence of
SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, donor qualifications were based strictly on their positive COVID-19
diagnostic test and eligibility for plasma donation.

The production of RBD antigen from SARS-CoV-2 was previously described (3). The NTD
antigen (16–305 amino acids, Accession: P0DTC2.1) was cloned into the pαH mammalian
expression vector and purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose in the same manner.

The RBD ELISA assay used in this study was initially described here (3), and the NTD ELISA
was performed in the same manner. Briefly ELISAs were done either as a single-point dilution at
1:40 or as serial titrations starting at a dilution of 1:20 or 1:40. ELISA plates were coated with
200ng/well of antigen and blocked, a 2-fold serum dilution series was done and diluted sera was
incubated for 1hr at 37°C. Alkaline-phosphatase linked secondary antibodies were used at
1:2500 dilution (IgM and IgG, Sigma; IgA, Abcam). PNPP substrate (Sigma) was added to
develop the plate and absorbance was measured at 10 minutes for total Ig, IgG or 25 minutes
for IgA or IgM at 405nm using a plate reader (BioTek). Each sample was performed in duplicate.

Antibody titration measurements were recorded as end-point titers. Ten plasma samples were
tested in the RBD total Ig format and compared to serum, all titer results were within a 2-fold
dilution (data not shown). ROC analyses were done to obtain cutoff values and sensitivity and
specificity estimates on the SARS-CoV-2 assays using pre-2019 negative control sera and RTPCR confirmed COVID-19 cases that were at least nine days post-symptom onset
(Supplementary Table 4). Positive and negative controls were used to standardize each ELISA
assay and normalize across experiments.

Detection of IgG antibody to SARS-CoV-2 N antigen was performed with a microparticle
chemiluminescence assay (Abbott Laboratories) on the Abbott Architect i2000SR immunoassay
analyzer. The EUA approved Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay utilizes microparticles coated with
SARS-CoV-2 N protein to capture N specific IgG. Bound IgG was detected via addition of antihuman acridinium-labeled second-step antibody. Following a second wash step, pre-trigger and
trigger solutions were added and a chemiluminescent reaction was detected and reported in
relative light units (RLU). The RLU generated is reflective of the amount of antibody bound to
the microparticles. The sample RLU was compared to the assay-specific calibrator RLU to
generate an index value (S/C). Index values >/= 1.4 were considered positive. Sensitivity and
specificity has been previously obtained for this assay (Supplementary Table 4) (37, 38).

Full-length SARS-CoV-2 viruses expressing a nano-luciferase gene were designed and
recovered via reverse genetics as previously described (3, 24) in a 96-well micro neutralization
format. Briefly, Vero E6 cells were infected with SARS-2-pLuc viruses and titered to generate an
8-point curve. Initial serum dilutions to detect the presence of neutralizing antibody were 1:20 or
1:50, and all serum samples were tested in duplicate. Internal serum controls, cell-only controls,
and virus-only controls were included in each neutralization assay plate. Plates were incubated
for 48 hours, at which point cells were lysed and luciferase activity was measured on a NanoGlo Luciferase Assay System (Promega). Antibody neutralization titers to SARS-CoV-2 were
reported as serum dilutions at which a 50% reduction in relative light units (NT50) to virus-only
controls were observed. LOD was set to 1:10, or ½ the starting dilution of 1:20, since all NT50
values above a titer of 1:10 that were run with a 1:50 starting dilution were > 1:25. Thirteen
plasma samples were tested and compared to serum, all NT50 results were within a 3-fold
dilution (data not shown). Pre-COVID-19 serum samples were also tested, and 13/13 had NT50
< 1:20 in this assay.

The “PhenoSense SARS CoV-2 nAb Assay” has been developed by leveraging the proprietary
PhenoSense Assay platform that was developed to evaluate antiretroviral drug susceptibility(39)
and later adapted to evaluate entry inhibitors and neutralizing antibody(40) as well as coreceptor tropism(41). The production of luciferase is dependent on virus entry and the
completion of a single round of virus replication. Agents that inhibit pseudovirus entry or

The measurement of neutralizing antibody activity using the PhenoSense SARS CoV-2 nAb
Assay is performed by generating HIV-1 pseudovirions that contain and express the complete
SARS CoV-2 spike protein open reading frame. The pseudovirus is prepared by co-transfecting
HEK293 producer cells with an HIV-1 genomic vector and a SARS CoV-2 envelope expression
vector. Neutralizing antibody activity is measured by assessing the inhibition of luciferase
activity in HEK293 target cells expressing the ACE2 receptor following pre-incubation of the
pseudovirions with serial dilutions of the serum specimen. The expression of luciferase activity
in target cells is inhibited in the presence of anti-SARS CoV-2 neutralizing antibody. Data are
displayed by plotting the percent inhibition of luciferase activity against log10 reciprocal of the
serum/plasma dilution. Neutralizing antibody titers are reported as the reciprocal of the serum
dilution conferring 50% inhibition (NT50) of pseudovirus infection.

The results of the PhenoSense SARS CoV-2 nAb Assay can be reported as an NT50 titer
(1/Dilution) or qualitatively (positive, negative) based on a pre-defined dilution cutoff (e.g. >50%
inhibition at 1:40 dilution). To insure that the measured neutralizing antibody activity is SARS
CoV-2 specific, each test specimen is also assessed using a non-specific pseudovirus
(specificity control) that expresses a non-reactive envelope protein of one or more unrelated
viruses (e.g. avian influenza virus).

We used the Wilcoxon rank-sum test to test for differences between two groups and the
Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Benjamini-Yekutieli correction to test for differences between
three or more groups. We calculated the phi coefficient as a measure of association between
two binary factors and relied on the Chi-square test to test for differences. We also calculated
the Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient, and used locally estimated scatterplot smoothing
(LOESS) to visualize antibody trends over time. Linear regression models were used to further
assess relationships with antibody levels, after first transforming antibody levels to the base-2
logarithm scale. Venn diagram and correlation heat maps were created to visualize
associations. All statistical analyses were performed using R 4.0.2 (Vienna, Austria), all tests
were two-sided and a P-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.

demographic and COVID-19 disease characteristics. RT-PCR; Reverse-transcriptase
polymerase chain reaction. Symptom grades: GRADE 1 MILD; Mild symptoms causing no or
minimal interference with usual social & functional activities with intervention not indicated.
GRADE 2 MODERATE; Moderate symptoms causing greater than minimal interference with
usual social & functional activities with intervention indicated. GRADE 3 SEVERE; Severe
symptoms causing inability to perform usual social & functional activities with intervention or
hospitalization indicated. Oxygen administered via nasal cannula. GRADE 4 POTENTIALLY
LIFE-THREATENING; potentially life-threatening symptoms causing inability to perform basic
self-care functions with intervention indicated to prevent permanent impairment, persistent
disability, or death. Hospitalization requiring intubation or use of supplemental oxygen (CPAP or
oxygen administered via mask).
