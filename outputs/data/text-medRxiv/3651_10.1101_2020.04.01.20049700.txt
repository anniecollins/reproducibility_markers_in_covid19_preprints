Take home message: Glucocorticoids inhibit type I interferon beta signaling and the upregulation
of CD73 that is a key molecule preventing vascular leakage and harmful leukocyte infiltration into
the lungs. This work provides the mechanistic basis for the need to avoid glucocorticoids in viralinduced ARDS, in which endogenous interferon is needed to combat the infection and its
consequences.

Abstract
Purpose: Glucocorticoids are widely used to treat acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
despite its use is highly controversial based on randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses. As
type I interferons (IFNs) are our first line of defense against severe viral respiratory infections, we
explored whether glucocorticoids interfere with IFN signaling and whether their use associates to
outcome of IFN beta treatment of ARDS.
Methods: We performed a propensity-matched post-hoc-analysis using data from the recent
randomized INTEREST-trial comparing IFN beta-1a to placebo in ARDS patients. Based on the results
of these analyses we utilized human lung tissue and human pulmonary endothelial cell cultures to
investigate the effect of hydrocortisone on IFN nuclear signaling and the protein transcription of
CD73, a molecule responsible for vascular integrity.
Results: We found that hydrocortisone reduces the production, and prevents the nuclear
translocation of IRF9, that is required for IFN beta-dependent signaling of multiple IFN-induced
genes. In addition, hydrocortisone inhibits IFN beta-dependent upregulation of CD73 in human lung
tissue. Additionally, we found that use of glucocorticoids with IFN beta-1a was independently
associated with increased mortality (OR 5.4, 95% CI 2.1–13.9, P< 0.001) in the INTEREST-trial.
Conclusions: Glucocorticoids inhibit type I IFN beta signaling and the upregulation of CD73 in human
lung. This provides the mechanistic basis for the harmful association of glucocorticoids in IFN beta
treated patients in the INTEREST-trial. Most importantly, it strongly speaks against the use of
glucocorticoids in viral-induced ARDS such as in the current corona virus pandemia.

Introduction
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a condition characterized by pulmonary
inflammation, diffuse pulmonary edema and refractory hypoxemia that may complicate
pneumonia, sepsis, trauma and lead to multi-organ failure. ARDS mortality is approximately 35-40%
depending on the severity of the disorder [1]. The treatment of ARDS still relies on the management
of the underlying disease and supportive care since pharmacological interventions targeting key
pathophysiological determinants of ARDS are still not available [2]. The key pathophysiological
event of ARDS is an uncontrolled inflammatory response resulting in injury of the endothelialalveolar barrier with increased pulmonary vascular leakage [1, 3].
Endogenous production of type I IFNs (IFN beta and alpha) is of outmost importance to fight
against viral and bacterial infections [4], since it upregulates cluster of differentiation 73 (CD73)
expressed on endothelium cells. CD73 is an enzyme controlling endothelial barrier function and
leucocyte recruitment to sites of inflammation via the production of adenosine [5-7], a highly antiinflammatory substance having cardioprotective, neuroprotective, vasodilatory and angiogenic
properties [8]. A phase II trial showed that upregulation of CD73 via intravenous administration of
recombinant human interferon is associated with a reduction in 28-day mortality in ARDS [9]. A
following placebo-controlled phase III trial (INTEREST) showed that intravenous recombinant
human interferon beta-1a did not improve outcome in patients with ARDS [10]. However, the study
showed that use of corticosteroids at baseline was higher than 50% and post-hoc analyses revealed
a statistically significant interaction between baseline corticosteroids and the treatment group [10].
This present study was set out to test the hypothesis that the lack of efficacy of recombinant
human IFN beta-1a in patients with ARDS could be related to the interference of glucocorticoids
with IFN beta-1a administration and prevent upregulation of CD73. Accordingly, we first performed
a post-hoc propensity-matched analysis of the INTEREST trial (ClincalTrials.gov Identifier
NCT02622724), and second we investigated the effects of glucocorticoids on IFN signaling and the
up-regulation of CD73 expression using human lung organ cultures and human pulmonary

endothelial cells ex vivo. Although there is preclinical evidence that steroids block endogenous IFN
signaling, this work puts this into context for the critical care community treating ARDS.

Methods
Post-hoc propensity- matched analyses from the INTEREST trial
The INTEREST trial was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial conducted at
74 intensive care units in 8 European countries (from December 2015 to December 2017) that
included 301 adults with moderate to severe ARDS. Patients were randomized to receive an
intravenous injection of 10 µg IFN beta-1a (144 patients) or placebo (152 patients)[10]. In this
analysis we explored the possible interaction between glucocorticoids and IFN beta-1a. We present
the Kaplan-Meyer survival curves until day 90 for IFN beta-1a treated patients with and without
concomitant (D0-D6) glucocorticoids.
In addition, we performed propensity score (representing the risk to receive glucocorticoids
at randomization) matching in the IFN group to obtain a more reliable estimate of the confounding
effect of glucocorticoids on IFN beta-1a treatment. The propensity score was calculated based on a
logistic regression model including age, gender, ARDS severity, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health
Evaluation (APACHE) II and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores. The propensity
score was included in the final logistic regression model to evaluate independent factors related to
28-day mortality. Furthermore, we present a comparison between propensity-matched patient
groups. We present the associations with 28-day mortality as odds ratios (95% confidence intervals,
CIs).
Organ and cell cultures
Human lung experiments were repeated as previously presented by Bellingan et al.[9] except that
hydrocortisone treatment was added as indicated below. In brief, a lung specimen from 11 different
individuals were obtained by post-surgical resection of lung tissue (typically for cancer resections).
The lung sections were from lung regions having normal macro- and microscopic appearance and

were used with the permission from the ethics authorities at Turku University Hospital (Finland).
Several small pieces were cut from all samples and 5-6 pieces/well/condition were cultured for 1
and 4 days in 24 well plates containing 1 ml of RPMI medium (supplemented with 10% fetal calf
serum, 4 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin), IFN beta (1000 UI/ml
FP1201 or the drug substance (Faron Pharmaceuticals) or placebo with and without hydrocortisone
(40µg/ml, Solucortef, Pfizer). FP1201 is a lyophilized form of the drug substance. After culturing, all
pieces in each well were collected and frozen in OCT.
On day 1, human pulmonary endothelial cells (PromoCell) were plated 50 000 cells/well in
endothelial cell growth MV medium (C-22020, PromoCell) with the supplement mix (C-19225,
PromoCell) and penicillin/streptomycin to 8 well ibidi plates (Falcon). On day 2, hydrocortisone
20µg/ml (Solucortef, Pfizer) was added to half of the wells. On day 3, IFN beta (FP1201, 1000IU/ml
from Faron or Rebif, 1000IU/ml from Merck) or placebo and incubation was continued for one day.
Two different lots of the cells were used.
Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence
Six µm thick sections were cut from cultured lung pieces and fixed with acetone. Thereafter, the
sections were stained using monoclonal anti-CD73 antibody (4G4) or a negative class matched
control antibody, both 10 µg/ml followed by Alexa Fluor488 conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG
(Invitrogen) or HRP conjugated anti-mouse IgG (DAKO). Diaminobenzidine was used as a chromogen
in peroxidase staining. The number of CD73 positive vessels was counted using stained sections and
on average 20 fields/sample were counted with 200x magnification using a fluorescence microscope
(Olympus).
Human pulmonary cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and fixed with
4% paraformaldehyde followed by treatments with 0,1 M glycine in PBS. Thereafter, the cells were
incubated for 15 min in PBS containing 0.1% Triton-X and stained using anti-IRF9 antibody from LS
Bio (LS-C155416) or rabbit Ig as a negative control. The second stage antibody was FITC-anti- rabbit

IgG (Sigma). The signal was intensified by using Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-FITC. The samples
were mounted with Mowiol containing 2.5% DABCO (Sigma).
Gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting
The nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of human pulmonary endothelial cells with or without IFN
beta-1a (1000IU/ml) ± hydrocortisone (20µg/ml) were isolated using 0.1% Triton X-100 and
centrifugation at 11000 rpm. Hydrocortisone was added one day before IFN beta-1a and the
pulmonary endothelial cells were lysed two hours after addition of IFN beta-1a. The protein
concentration of all samples was determined by BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) and the same amount
of protein was loaded on to the gel (SDS-Page). Blotting was performed using BioRad blotting
system (Trans-Blot Turbo Transfer System). Blocking of the non-specific binding of the nitrocellulose
transfer membranes (0.2µm) was performed with 5% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Tween 20 in
Tris buffered saline. The membranes were blotted with anti-IRF9 (LS Bio), followed by HRPconjugated anti-rabbit IgG (DAKO). GAPDH as a loading control for cytoplasmic proteins was
detected with anti-GAPDH antibody (Hytest Ltd) followed by IRDye800CW donkey anti-mouse IgG
(Licor) and Histone H3 as a loading control for nuclear proteins with anti-Histone H3 antibody (Cell
signalling) followed by IRDye680RD goat anti-rabbit IgG (Licor). Millipore Immobilon Western was
used for signal detection.

qPCR
Human pulmonary endothelial cells treated as described for gel analyses were collected and stored
in RNAprotect Cell Reagent (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) at -70°C. This was followed by RNA
extraction with the NucleoSpin RNA kit (Macherey-Nagel, Dueren, Germany) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol.

For qPCR assays, the conversion of RNA to cDNA was done with

SuperScript VILO cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Espoo, Finland), followed by qPCR
using the TaqMan Gene Expression Assays (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Espoo, Finland) for MX1

IFNAR2 (Hs01022059_m1), and GAPDH (Hs02758991_g1; control gene). The reactions were run
using the Applied Biosystems' Quant Studio 3 Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The
target mRNA levels were normalised to GAPDH and a fold change of relative expression from the
appropriate unstimulated control was calculated using the Applied Biosytems® analysis modules in
Thermo Fisher Cloud computing platform (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Espoo, Finland).

Results
Clinical data
Seventy-eight out of 144 patients (54%) included in the IFN beta-1a treatment arm of the INTEREST
trial received glucocorticoids during the 28-day study period, 56% (44/78) at randomization (D0),
27% (21/78) during the treatment (D1–6), and 17% (13/78) after the treatment (D7 onwards). The
reported reasons for administering systemic glucocorticoids were: shock 33%, anti-inflammatory
17%, ARDS 14% and other 36% (fibrosis, immunosuppression post-transplant, adrenal insuffiency,
pulmonary obstruction). The most commonly used glucocorticoids were hydrocortisone 200mg per
day (59%) or methylprednisolone 40 – 120mg per day (39%) when used together with IFN beta-1a.
Only 1 patient received dexamethasone with IFN beta-1a and that because of lymphoma. D28
mortality for patients receiving glucocorticoids with IFN beta-1a was 39.7% compared to 10.6% for
patients receiving IFN beta-1a alone (Table 1). The Kaplan-Meier curves of the IFN beta-1a
treatment arm adjusted by ARDS severity and divided according to the overlapping (D0 – D6) use of
glucocorticoids with IFN beta-1a treatment demonstrate significantly increased mortality by
glucocorticoid use (p = 0.0002, Figure 1). Patients who received glucocorticoids were more severely
ill according to SOFA and APACHE II scores, but no significant difference in vasopressor use, P/F
ratio, or in ventilation settings (Table 1). The demographic data on propensity-matched patients
(glucocorticoids vs. no glucocorticoids) are presented in Table 2.

In the post-hoc propensity-matched analysis of the IFN beta-1a arm (n=144), baseline systemic
glucocorticoid treatment was independently associated with D28 mortality (OR 5.4, 95% CI 2.1 –
13.9, P < 0.001) according to logistic regression. When the propensity matched analysis was
performed using an exact matching (a precision of 0.01 propensity units), there were 49 pairs of
patients who received or did not receive glucocorticoids (n=98). Among these patients, OR for
increased mortality was 4.6 (95% CI 1.6 – 13.5) for those who had baseline systemic glucocorticoid
treatment and 3.5 (95% CI 1.0 – 12.0) for those who initiated glucocorticoid treatment while
receiving IFN beta-1a (Table 3). Glucocorticoid treatment after IFN beta-1a treatment (D7 onwards)
was not associated with increased mortality.
Hydrocortisone inhibits CD73 upregulation in lung organ cultures
We tested the possible inhibitory effects of hydrocortisone (HC) on IFN beta-1a induced
upregulation of CD73 on blood vessels by culturing histologically normal lung tissue in the presence
of IFN beta-1a with or without HC over a 4 day time course. Two different formulations of IFN beta1a were used, FP-1201, a lyophilized product used in the phase III trial and the drug substance (DS)
before lyophilization. When IFN beta-1a was applied to the culture medium CD73 expression was
upregulated in comparison to the cultures without IFN beta-1a, and both pharmaceutical forms of
IFN beta-1a induced a similar level of CD73 upregulation. However, in the presence of
hydrocortisone, CD73 upregulation was inhibited (Figure 2 a,b).

Hydrocortisone blocks IRF9 nuclear translocation and consequently IFN beta dependent signaling
pathways in pulmonary lung endothelial cells
IFN beta-1a signaling via its receptor leads to the formation of a heterotrimeric transcription
complex ISGF3 containing STAT1-STAT2 and IRF9, which then enters the nucleus and binds to the
IFN beta responsive elements of several genes [11] or assembly on DNA [12]. As the main target of
glucocorticoids is the type I interferon pathway in pulmonary epithelium [13], we tested whether
this is also true in the endothelium. Primary human pulmonary endothelial cells were cultured in

the presence of IFN beta-1a with and without HC or culture medium only as a baseline control. The
expression of IRF9 was analyzed by immunofluorescence staining. As expected, IFN beta-1a induced
the translocation of IRF9 into the nucleus, which was reduced by HC treatment (Fig 2c). To further
confirm these findings, we isolated the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments of the pulmonary
endothelial cells and analyzed them separately for IRF9 by SDS-PAGE and subsequent
immunoblotting (Fig 2d). Similarly, also these analyses show IRF9 translocation into the nucleus
subsequent to IFN beta-1a treatment, which could be reduced by HC. In addition, HC treatment
decreased IRF9 and STAT1 mRNA synthesis when measured by qPCR (Fig 2e), which was also seen
at the protein level in Fig. 2c. In contrast, HC did not decrease the mRNA synthesis of the IFN
alfa/beta receptor subunits as the mRNA synthesis of the IFN alfa/beta receptor (IFNAR1 and
IFNAR2 subunits) increased 9 and 20%, respectively, subsequent to HC addition.

Discussion
Our clinical and experimental data suggest an association between glucocorticoid treatment and
increased D28 mortality that might be related to the hydrocortisone-induced inhibition of CD73
upregulation in human lung tissue and IFN beta dependent signaling pathways in pulmonary
endothelial cells.
The use of steroids in patients with ARDS has generated great controversies [14]. While
early studies suggested a clinical benefit [15] subsequent studies did not support the routine use of
steroids for early [16] and persistent [17] ARDS. Our findings are consistent with a contemporary
Bayesean meta-analysis that showed steroids are ineffective/harmful for ARDS [18] but contradict
the results from a recent RCT on dexamethasone in ARDS patients [19]. Notable is that the
dexamethasone study by Villar et al. excluded patients that were already receiving steroids at
enrollment. Other possible explanations for all these inconsistent findings may lay on the origin of
ARDS (viral vs. other) [20-23], genetic factors, or the use of different corticosteroids. The use of IFN

beta treatment in INTEREST trial may shed light to this complex issue as only hydrocortisone and
methylprednisolone were used and the majority of patients were already receiving them prior to
receiving IFN beta-1a.
Increasing extracellular adenosine by activation of CD73 on epithelial and endothelial cells
is one of the biological targets of IFN beta-1a. Adenosine is one of the physiological regulators of
endothelial cell permeability and accelerates alveolar fluid reabsorption and inhibits leukocyte
recruitment [24]. Although a previous study has shown that steroids inhibit the effect of type I IFN
signaling in asthmatic epithelium [13], the use of corticosteroids was unexpectedly high (64.5% in
placebo and 54.2% in the IFN beta-1a group) in the INTEREST study. Therefore, the present analyses
focused on the possible interaction between steroids and IFN beta-1a in human pulmonary
endothelium and CD73 expression, which a key enzyme for local adenosine production and vascular
integrity. We found a significant increase in the risk of death for the baseline systemic glucocorticoid
treatment and for glucocorticoid use overlapping with the IFN beta-1a treatment (Table 3). Since
type I IFNs (IFN beta and alpha) are endogenously produced and are of utmost importance to fight
against infections (bacterial and viral)[4], these observations may explain the fact that
glucocorticoid use for patients with virus triggered ARDS is associated with an increased risk of death
[16]. In line with these interpretations, others have shown that the use of recombinant human IFN
beta inhibits SARS virus replication and has antiviral potential even after infection [25].
Furthermore, the use of IFN alpha was associated with lower mortality in the previous MERS
epidemic [26], but IFNs failed to repeat the results in a larger cohort of MERS patients [27]. However,
these patients received sub-cutaneous IFN beta which gives limited direct drug exposure to lung
endothelial cells. More importantly, 60% of these patients received corticosteroids, which based on
our findings prevents IFN beta signaling.
Earlier reports shown that glucocorticoids target type I interferon signaling pathways by
inhibiting the assembly of the ISGF3 complex in mouse macrophages and human epithelial cells [11,
13, 28]. In our pulmonary endothelial cell cultures, we observed that, the use of hydrocortisone for
one day reduced the mRNA synthesis of IRF9 and STAT1 – the components of the ISGF3 complex.
The effect was not due to the downregulation of IFN alpha/beta receptor. Moreover, we witnessed

inhibition of IRF9 translocation into the nucleus, which is a requirement for triggering IFN beta
responsive genes. IFR9 is essential for type I IFN response as its’ deficiency leads to severe lifethreatening conditions by common viral infection [29]. As there are more than 7300 type 1
interferon responsive genes (http://www.interferome.org/interferome/site/dbStat.jspx) the
effects of glucocorticoids are extensive already when taken only their targeting of type 1 IFN
signaling pathways into account. In addition, glucocorticoids inhibit the production and secretion of
type I IFNs themselves [30]. We used hydrocortisone in ex vivo experiments as it is commonly used
in clinical practice. Although glucocorticoids have different potencies, they all act via the
glucocorticoid receptor and affect the same signaling pathways [31], thus the obtained effects are
expected to be generalized to all glucocorticoids used to treat ARDS patients.
As STAT1-STAT2-IRF9 complex also drives the expression of HIF-1a [32], it can be envisioned
that also the expression of HIF-1a is decreased due to glucocorticoid use. In addition, HIF-1a
mediated transactivation of genes may also be impacted as glucocorticoids induce the
phosphorylation of GRIP1 [33], a normal interaction required for HIF-1a mediated gene
transactivation. These earlier data together with our ex vivo results utilizing hydrocortisone together
with IFN beta-1a demonstrate that glucocorticoids interfere with the production of CD73, since the
gene encoding for CD73 contains response elements for interferons (ISRE) and hypoxia (HRE) [34,
35].
In conclusion, we found that hydrocortisone inhibits CD73 upregulation in human lung tissue
and IFN beta dependent signaling pathways in pulmonary endothelial cells. CD73 is an important
regulator of the vascular integrity especially needed in conditions such as ARDS. Therefore, these
experimental findings, in combination with our propensity-matched analysis from IFN beta-1a
treated patients from the INTERERST trial, provide a mechanistic evidence of the harmful effect of
glucocorticoids on the IFN response in the human lung. These data provides a rationale for
contraindication to use steroids in patients with ARDS of viral origin, when an IFN response is
required.

Figure 2. Hydrocortisone (HC) blunts IFN beta induced CD73 upregulation in lung vasculature and signaling
pathways in pulmonary endothelial cells. a Immunohistochemical staining of CD73 (brown) in lung tissue
incubated in the presence of IFN beta with or without HC for 1 and 4 days (D). D0 indicates baseline
expression of CD73 in fresh lung tissue. b Quantification of CD73 positive vessels/mm2. The samples were
incubated in the presence of two different IFN beta-1a formulations (FP-1201, circles n=10 (day 1) and n=11
(day 4); DS, triangles n=8). Each data point marks an individual. The dotted line represent the placebo induced
level of CD73 expression. Statistical significance was analyzed using Mann Whitney test. Scale bars 100µm. c
Immunofluorescence staining of IRF9 in primary human pulmonary endothelial cells after IFN beta treatment
with or without HC showing marked inhibition of nuclear translocation of IRF9 by HC, representative results
of three independent ones with similar results. d Immunoblotting of cytosolic and nuclear fractions of
pulmonary endothelial cells after IFN beta-1a ± HC demonstrating both decrease in the signal of IRF9 and its
translocation. Specific IRF9 band is indicated by an arrow, A representative blot of five independent analyses
with comparable results. GAPDH and H3 (histone) are loading controls for the cytoplasmic and nuclear
fractions, respectively. e qPCR results of two independent experiments demonstrating the decrease of IFN
beta-1a triggered mRNA synthesis of IRF9 and STAT1 by HC.
