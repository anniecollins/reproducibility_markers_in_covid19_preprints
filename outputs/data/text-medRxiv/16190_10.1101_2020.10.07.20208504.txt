Summary Line: Relying on reported cases and test positivity rates individually can result in

18

incorrect inferences as to the spread of COVID-19, and public health decision-making can be

19

improved by instead using their geometric mean as a measure of COVID-19 prevalence and

transmission.

Abstract

47

Accurate estimates of infection prevalence and seroprevalence are essential for evaluating and

48

informing public health responses needed to address the ongoing spread of COVID-19 in the

49

United States. A data-driven Bayesian single parameter semi-empirical model was developed and

50

used to evaluate state-level prevalence and seroprevalence of COVID-19 using daily reported

51

cases and test positivity ratios. COVID-19 prevalence is well-approximated by the geometric

52

mean of the positivity rate and the reported case rate. As of December 8, 2020, we estimate nation-

53

wide a prevalence of 1.4% [Credible Interval (CrI): 0.8%-1.9%] and a seroprevalence of 11.1%

54

[CrI: 10.1%-12.2%], with state-level prevalence ranging from 0.3% [CrI: 0.2%-0.4%] in Maine to

55

3.0% [CrI: 1.1%-5.7%] in Pennsylvania, and seroprevalence from 1.4% [CrI: 1.0%-2.0%] in

56

Maine to 22% [CrI: 18%-27%] in New York. The use of this simple and easy-to-communicate

57

model will improve the ability to make public health decisions that effectively respond to the

58

ongoing pandemic.

Introduction

69

Accurate or reliable estimates of the prevalence and seroprevalence of infection are

70

essential for evaluating and informing public health responses and vaccination strategies to

71

mitigate the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The gold standard method to empirically measure

72

disease prevalence and seroprevalence is to conduct periodic large-scale surveillance testing via

73

random sampling (1). However, this approach may be time- and resource-intensive, and only a

74

handful of such surveillance studies has been conducted so far in the United States (US) (2–7).

75

Therefore, public health officials have relied on alternative metrics, such as test positivity,

76

reported cases, fatality rates, hospitalization rates, and epidemiological models’ predictions, to

77

inform COVID-19 responses. Test positivity has, for instance, been commonly used to infer the

78

level of COVID-19 transmission in a population and/or the adequacy of testing (8,9). However,

79

the justifications for use of this metric often reference a WHO recommendation intended to be

80

applied only in a sentinel surveillance context (10), rather than in more general context as it has

81

been frequently implemented. As measures of prevalence, test positivity and reported cases,

82

though readily available and well-understood by public health officials, are very likely to

83

substantially over- and underestimate, respectively, disease transmission/prevalence and

84

seroprevalence (1). Hospitalization and death rates are also similarly readily available, but tend to

85

lag infections by several weeks and only reflect the most severe outcomes (1). Finally,

86

epidemiological models are generally complex mathematical, computational, or statistical models

87

that require extensive data and information for model training, and are perceived as a “black box

88

by most public health practitioners and decision makers (11–13).

89

Here, we develop a simple semi-empirical model to estimate the prevalence and

90

seroprevalence of COVID-19 at the US state level based only on reported cases, test positivity

91

rate, and testing rate (Figure 1). Specifically, we hypothesized that the preferential nature of

92

diagnostic testing for individuals at higher risk of infection in the US is a convex function of the

93

overall testing rate due to the “diminishing return” from expanding general population testing

94

(Figure 1A-1B). We modeled this convexity using a negative power function, and calibrated the

95

power parameter using state-wide seroprevalence data, which has only recently become available

96

across all U.S. states (2–7). Infection prevalence estimates were then validated by comparing with

97

two independent, data-driven epidemiological models (11,14,15). We found that the state-level

98

prevalence of COVID-19 in the US can be well-approximated by a weighted average nearly equal

99

to the geometric mean of the reported cases and test positivity rates. We evaluated how disease

100

prevalence and seroprevalence varies with changes in reported cases and test positivity, and the

101

implications of applying this simple model on informing public health decision-making to the

102

COVID-19 pandemic in the US. We have implemented our model in an online dashboard

103

(https://wchiu.shinyapps.io/COVID-19-Prevalence-and-Seroprevalence/) to enable easy access by

104

public health officials and the public.

Methods

107

Conceptual basis of a semi-empirical model for the prevalence of COVID-19 infection
Test positivity rate 𝑃+,𝜏 (𝑡) = 𝑁+,𝜏 (𝑡)/𝑁test,𝜏 (𝑡) is defined as the percentage of positive

108
109

diagnostic tests administered over a given period 𝜏 between 𝑡 − 𝜏 and 𝑡. We first hypothesize that,

110

because testing is currently “preferential” (i.e., only those considered more likely to be infected

111

due to symptoms, contacts, etc., are tested), 𝑃+,𝜏 (𝑡) is correlated to the lagged prevalence 𝐼(𝑡 −

112

𝑡lag )/𝑁 of COVID-19-infected persons in the population with a time-dependent bias parameter

113

𝑏(𝑡):

𝑃+,𝜏 (𝑡) = 𝑏(𝑡) ×

𝐼(𝑡 − 𝑡lag )
𝑁

(1)

114

Conceptually, this relationship is shown in Figure 1A. We next hypothesize that the bias

115

parameter 𝑏(𝑡) is inversely related to the testing rate 𝛬𝜏 (𝑡) = 𝑁test,𝜏 (𝑡)/𝑁 over the same period 𝜏.

116

Clearly, at a testing rate of 1, where everyone is tested, there is no bias, so 𝑏 = 1. On the other

117

hand, for very low testing rates, the bias is likely to be high, as only the most severely ill will be

118

tested. For instance, if all COVID-19 deaths are tested daily, but no one else, then the positivity

119

rate will be equal to 100% and the bias will be equal to the inverse of the infection prevalence,

120

𝑏 = 𝑁/𝐼(𝑡 − 𝑡lag ). Moreover, at low testing rates, increasing the testing rate will likely

121

preferentially increase the infected population testing rate relative to the general population testing

122

rate, so 𝑏(𝑡) will decline more rapidly than at higher testing rates, as there is “diminishing return”

123

from increased testing. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that 𝑏(𝑡) is a convex function of 𝛬𝜏 (𝑡).

124

We therefore model the bias as a negative power function of 𝛬𝜏 (𝑡):
𝑁test,𝜏 (𝑡) −𝑛
𝑏(𝑡) = [
] ≡ 𝛬𝜏 (𝑡)−𝑛
𝑁

(2)

125

While this appears to imply an unbounded bias as the testing rate goes to zero, as shown below,

126

our model will naturally limit the bias parameter when test positivity is 100%. Combining

127

equations (1)-(2), and re-arranging leads to the following relationship between test positivity and

128

the infectious population:
𝐼(𝑡 − 𝑡lag )
= 𝑃+,𝜏 (𝑡) × 𝛬𝜏 (𝑡)𝑛
𝑁

(3)

129

Additionally, because test positivity and the testing rate share a term 𝑁test,𝜏 (𝑡), equation (3) can be

130

further rearranged as
𝐼(𝑡 − 𝑡lag )
𝑁+,𝜏 (𝑡) 𝑛
1−𝑛
= 𝑃+,𝜏 (𝑡)
[
] ≡ 𝑃+,𝜏 (𝑡)1−𝑛 × 𝐶+,𝜏 (𝑡)𝑛

131

where the last term is the reported cases per capita 𝐶+,𝜏 (𝑡) = 𝑁+,𝜏 (𝑡)/𝑁. Thus, our hypothesis

132

predicts that the infectious population is proportional to a weighted geometric mean of the

133

positivity rate and the reported case rate, with n = ½ corresponding to equal weighting.

134
135

We can also rearrange equation (1) and view the bias parameter as the relative efficacy of
testing infected individuals compared to the general population:
𝑏(𝑡) =

𝑁+,𝜏 (𝑡)/𝐼(𝑡 − 𝑡lag ) 𝛬𝐼,𝜏,𝑡lag (𝑡)
≡
𝑁test,𝜏 (𝑡)/𝑁
𝛬𝜏 (𝑡)

(5)

136

Here, 𝛬𝐼,𝜏,𝑡lag (𝑡) is the daily rate of testing of infectious individuals (with averaging time 𝜏 and lag

137

𝑡lag ), whereas 𝛬𝜏 (𝑡) is the daily rate of testing of the general population, as previously defined.

138

Thus, the bias reflects the extent to which infectious individuals are “preferentially” tested.

139

Moreover, due to the way 𝐼(𝑡 − 𝑡lag ) is calculated, when positivity is 100% so that 𝑁+,𝜏 (𝑡) =

140

𝑁test,𝜏 (𝑡), the bias appropriately equals 𝑁/𝐼(𝑡 − 𝑡lag ).

141

We use this semi-empirical model for infection prevalence to estimate seroprevalence

142

SP(t) using a simple first order, one-compartment model that depends only on the mean infection

143

duration Tinf (Figure 1C). Because testing data are available on a daily basis, we use a discrete

144

time model SP(𝑡) = SP(𝑡 − 1) + 𝐼(𝑡 − 1)/𝑇inf. The seroprevalence at any time t is then the

145

cumulative sum of the infection prevalence values at times < t divided by the infection duration

146

SP(𝑡) = SPo + Σ𝑡 ′ <𝑡 𝐼(𝑡′)/𝑇inf. As an initial condition, we allow for an offset SPo for missed

147

infections during the early part of the pandemic before regular and large-scale testing was

148

established. Therefore, combining with equation (4) gives the seroprevalence as:
SP(𝑡 − 𝑡lag ) SPo
𝑃+,𝜏 (𝑡)1−𝑛 × 𝐶+,𝜏 (𝑡)𝑛
=
+∑
.
𝑁
𝑁
𝑇inf
𝑡 ′ <𝑡

149
150

(6)

Equations (4) and (6) therefore comprise the complete semi-empirical model for infection
prevalence and seroprevalence based solely on positivity 𝑃+,𝜏 (𝑡) and the reported case rates

151

𝐶+,𝜏 (𝑡), which we calculate from data obtained from the COVID Tracking Project (16), averaged

152

of the past 𝜏 days. We fix the averaging time 𝜏 at 14 days, and the lag time 𝑡lag at 7 days, so the

153

semi-empirical model has only three remaining free parameters: the power parameter n, the

154

infection during Tinf, and the initial condition for seroprevalence SPo.

155

Bayesian calibration to seroprevalence data

156

To calibrate the model, we utilized state-wide seroprevalence data, which has only recently

157

become available for all 50 states and the District of Columbia (Table S1). We used a Bayesian

158

MCMC approach to calibrate the model to the empirical data (Table 1) and the potential scale

159

reduction factor (PSRF) was used to assess convergence, with a value of <1.2 regarded as

160

adequate (17,18). Details about model calibration are found in the Supplementary Methods.

161

Validation of prevalence estimates with epidemiological models

162

For validation, we compare prevalence estimates to those of two models of SARS-CoV-2

163

transmission in U.S. states are considered here: a Bayesian extended-SEIR model (15) (run

164

through July 22, 2020) and a Bayesian semi-mechanistic model by Imperial College (19) (run

165

through July 20, 2020), which applies the model published by Flaxman et al., 2020 (11) to the US.

166

These models are calibrated at the US state-level to reported deaths and/or cases, but do not utilize

167

test positivity or testing rate as an input. Both of these are Bayesian models, and we use these

168

models’ posterior distributions for comparison.

169

Bias of test positivity and reported cases in estimating prevalence and seroprevalence

170

Our model can be used to estimate the degree of bias in current measures of prevalence

171

(test positivity and reported case rates) and seroprevalence (cumulative reported cases). The over-

172

reporting bias of test positivity as a measure of prevalence is already given in equation (2). The

173

under-reporting bias of reported case rates can be calculated by rearranging equation (4),

so the under-reporting bias is 𝑏(𝑡)(𝑛−1)/𝑛 , which is equal to 𝑏(𝑡) for n = ½. The implied bias from

175

cumulative reported cases as a measure of seroprevalence is calculated by dividing by sum of

176

𝐶+,𝜏 (𝑡) by the seroprevalence estimated by equation (6).

Software

178

All analyses were performed using the R statistical software (R version 3.6.1) in RStudio

179

(Version 1.2.1335). We developed a publicly available online dashboard, using R and Shiny, to

180

analyze and visualize state-level estimates of COVID-19 prevalence and seroprevalence from our

181

semi-empirical model (https://wchiu.shinyapps.io/COVID-19-Prevalence-and-Seroprevalence/).

182
183

Results

184

Bayesian calibration to seroprevalence data

185

Four independent Markov chain Monte Carlo chains were simulated, and reached adequate

186

convergence after 20,000 iterations per chain, with PSRF < 1.1 for all parameters (see Table 1 and

187

Table S2) and the multivariate PSRF=1.07. For inference, 2,000 samples were selected randomly

188

from across the 80,000 available iterations.

189

The 95% credible intervals for the power parameter n include 0.5 (corresponding to an

190

unweighted geometric mean) both for the fixed effect as well as for the state-specific random

191

effects (Table S2, Figure S1). For the seroprevalence offset SPo, the posterior median for most

192

states was < 1% initial condition, but two states had posterior medians > 5%. For NY, it was

193

estimated that 14% [95% CrI: 7.5%-20%] of initial cases were missed, and for LA, the posterior

194

estimate was 5.0% [CrI: 1.6%-8.6%]. These values are consistent with these two states having

195

large initial surges when testing was highly limited, and therefore were likely to have missed a

196

large number of cases. The large variation in SPo values across states is consistent with high

197

heterogeneity that has been noted both in the size of their initial surge of infections and in their

198

testing capacity and availability.

199

Comparison of posterior estimates and observations by state are shown in Figure 2, and

200

show the model to be highly consistent with available seroprevalence data both in terms of level

201

and trends. The residual error was estimated to have a standard deviation of 0.28 [CrI: 0.23-0.33]

202

on the natural log scale, corresponding to a coefficient of variation of 29% [CrI: 23%-33%], and

203

the R2 between the posterior median and the observed point estimates was 0.76 (Figure S2).

204
205

Validation of prevalence estimates with epidemiological models

206

We next compared our model estimates for the prevalence of active infections with those

207

from two independent epidemiologic models of U.S. states. As shown in Figure 3, the posterior

208

estimates of the semi-empirical model are highly consistent with those from the epidemiologic

209

models. The residual standard error (RSE) difference between the posterior medians of semi-

210

empirical estimate and the extended SEIR model is 0.52 natural log units (see Figure S3),

211

corresponding to a coefficient of variation of 56%, and have an R2 of 0.75. Similarly, the

212

comparison with the Imperial model yields an RSE of 0.73, corresponding to an 84% coefficient

213

of variation, and an R2 of 0.72. These RSE values should be taken in context of the posterior

214

uncertainty in the epidemiologic models themselves, which have individual uncertainties

215

corresponding to coefficients of variation of 45% and 23% for the extended SEIR and Imperial

216

models, respectively, as well as the differences between the two models, which have a coefficient

217

of variation of 63%. Overall, the semi-empirical estimate of infection prevalence is consistent

218

with the results of the available epidemiologic models.

219

Current estimates of prevalence and seroprevalence

220

As of December 8, 2020, our calibrated and validated semi-empirical model estimates that

221

in the US, infection prevalence was 1.4% [CrI: 0.8%-1.9%] with a seroprevalence of 11.1% [CrI:

222

10.1%-12.2%] (Figures 4, S4; Table S3). In individual states, estimated prevalence ranged from

223

0.3% [CrI: 0.2%-0.4%] in Maine to 3.0% [CrI: 1.1%-5.7%] in Pennsylvania, with 8 states having

224

at least 2% prevalence, and test positivity having a bias b between five and fifteen (Figure S4A).

225

The two-week trend in estimated prevalence was increasing in all but 15 states (Figure 4A).

226

Estimated seroprevalences in individual states ranged from 1.4% [CrI: 1.0%-2.0%] in Maine to

227

22% [CrI: 18%-27%] in New York, with 9 states exceeding 15%, and cumulative reported cases

228

typically accounting for around one in three of estimated total cases (Figures 4B, S4B).

229

Between April 1 and December 8, 2020, the test positivity rate bias b and the ratio between

230

estimated seroprevalence and cumulative reported cases were shown to decrease over time

231

(Figure S5). In April, the median positivity rate bias across states was 36 and the cumulative cases

232

underreporting bias ranged between 0.01 to 0.12 (i.e., only 1%-12% of cases were reported). By

233

the beginning of December, the median positivity rate bias had declined to 13 and the cumulative

234

cases underreporting bias ranged between 0.14 and 1 (Figures S5A, S5C). Across the U.S. in

235

aggregate, from April to December, the median positivity rate bias declined from 66 to 10, and the

236

cumulative cases underreporting bias improved from 0.03 to 0.33 (Figures S5B, S5D).

237

The pitfalls of relying on reported cases or test positivity rate alone to estimate the course

238

of the epidemic are illustrated for three states, MN, VA, and WI, where reported cases and

239

positivity trends were in opposite directions in May and/or August (Figure S6). Specifically, in

240

May, reported cases were rising substantially in MN, VA, and WI at the same time that the test

241

positivity rate was declining, testing rate was increasing, and the model predicted prevalence was

242

flat or decreasing (Figure S6). By contrast, in August, the states of MN and WI all showed

243

declining reported case rates while positivity was increasing, while our model predicts that

244

COVID-19 prevalence was actually increasing during this time. In both scenarios, the increase

245

(decrease) in reported cases was due to expanded (declining) testing rates, respectively.

246

248

Discussion
Reported case rates and test positivity rates have been widely used to inform or justify

249

public health decisions, such as increasing or relaxing non-pharmaceutical interventions, for the

250

control of the COVID-19 pandemic in the US (20,21). A recent report of the National Academies

251

of Sciences and Engineering Medicine (NASEM) has urged caution about the reliability/validity

252

of directly using data such as reported case rates and test positivity rates to inform decision

253

making for COVID-19 (1). Though these data are usually readily available, the NASEM report

254

concludes that they are likely to substantially underestimate or overestimate the real state of

255

disease spread (1). Therefore, there is a critical need to develop simple and more reliable data-

256

driven metrics/approaches to inform local public health decision-making.

257

We have developed a simple semi-empirical approach to estimate the prevalence and

258

seroprevalence of COVID-19 infections in a population using only reported cases and testing rates

259

that does not require developing and maintaining a complex, data-driven mathematical model.

260

Based on a simple hypothesis that the bias in test positivity is a convex, negative power function

261

of the testing rate, we find that the COVID-19 prevalence, with a 1-week lag, is well-

262

approximated by the geometric mean of the positivity rate and the reported case rate averaged over

263

the last 2 weeks. Seroprevalence can then be calculated in a straight-forward manner by taking a

264

cumulative sum while accounting for the duration between infection and seropositivity, a period of

265

typically 2 weeks, and a state-specific offset accounting for missed infections in the early part of

266

the pandemic prior to establishment of regular testing (equation 6). Our model resulted in an

267

accurate fit to recently available state-level seroprevalence data from across the U.S. Additionally,

268

the prevalence estimates of our semi-empirical model were shown to compare favorably to those

269

from two data-driven epidemiological models. We estimate nation-wide prevalence rate as of

270

December 8, 2020 to be 1.4% [CrI: 0.8%-1.9%], corresponding to a test positivity bias of around

271

10, and nation-wide seroprevalence to be 11.1% [CrI: 10.1%-12.2%], so that cumulative reported

272

cases correspond to approximately one-third of actual infections. At the state level, estimated

273

seroprevalence was one to seven times cumulative reported cases. These estimates compare

274

favorably to those previously published using more complicated approaches (22,23).

275

Our analysis suggests that public health policy related to either non-pharmaceutical

276

(masking and social distancing) or pharmaceutical interventions (vaccination) may be informed by

277

available data in four main ways:

278

•

First, prevalence should be inferred as decreasing only if both reported cases and positivity

279

rates are continuously declining without decreasing testing rates. This criterion can be

280

taken as a surrogate for 𝑅𝑒𝑓𝑓 (𝑡) < 1, since declining prevalence is a sufficient condition

281

for an effective reproduction number below one. When there is a divergence in direction of

282

the trends between reported cases and positivity (Figure S6), the trend in their geometric

283

mean can be used as an indicator of increasing or decreasing prevalence.

284

•

Second, the gap between reported case and test positivity rates should be decreasing in

285

order to ensure improvement in the sufficiency of testing. For most of the U.S., this gap

286

has hovered between 100- and 1000-fold. For example, in MN, VA, and WI (Figure S6),

287

as testing ramped up in May, the gap narrowed; however, the gap widened in August,

288

indicating that testing rates needed to be brought back up (24). Indeed, as noted by the

289

NASEM report, absolute testing rates, irrespective of positivity rates, may be a better

290

indicator of the sufficiency of testing.

291

•

Third, reported cases, test positivity, and testing rates should be publicly reported at the

292

county or municipal level in order to provide local governments, health agencies, medical

293

personnel, and the public with the necessary information to evaluate local pandemic

294

conditions. Currently, only reported cases are routinely provided at the local level, with

295

positivity and testing rates comprehensively aggregated only at the state level.

296

•

Finally, seroprevalence estimates can play a key role in forecasting future potential spread

297

of the pandemic and threshold vaccination coverage needed to stamp out disease

298

transmission at the state or community-level.

299

As with any model, ours has a number of limitations. The most significant limitation is the

300

lack of more comprehensive, random sampling-based data with which to further validate the

301

model. However, our model did accurately fit all the available seroprevalence data, including

302

recent CDC data at multiple time points across all 50 states and the District of Columbia (6). As

303

further validation of the approach, we applied our model internationally to 15 countries for which

304

both nation-wide seroprevalence data (Table S4) and daily testing data were available. The 95%

305

CrI for our model, using the random effects posterior distributions from our U.S. state-level

306

calibration, covered all the seroprevalence data except for Russia (Figure S7), suggesting that this

307

approach might be more broadly applicable, though requiring nation-specific calibration. With

308

respect to prevalence, we could only compare to epidemiologic model-based estimates of

309

prevalence due to lack of random sample-based surveillance data. However, we believe this

310

limitation is mitigated by our use of two independent estimates with completely different model

311

structures, one of which is a more traditional extended-SEIR model, and other of which is a “semi-

312

mechanistic” model partially statistical in nature. Another important limitation is the relatively

313

limited range of testing rate observations for most U.S. states (Figure 1B). For this reason, we

314

cannot necessarily guarantee that our results can be easily extrapolated to substantially higher

315

testing rates. However, with higher testing rates, the difference between test positivity rates and

316

reported case rates would decrease and reduce the effect of greater uncertainty in the degree of

317

bias between the test positivity rate and the lagged prevalence. Finally, we did not address the

318

sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic testing; however, the impact of imperfect test accuracy is

319

likely to have a minimal impact on our results.

320

In conclusion, we found that the COVID-19 prevalence is well-approximated by the

321

geometric mean of the positivity rate and the reported case rate, and that seroprevalence can be

322

estimated by taking a cumulative sum while accounting for the duration between infection and

323

seropositivity, a period of typically 2 weeks, and a state-specific offset. The use of this simple,

324

reliable, and easy-to-communicate approach to estimating COVID-19 prevalence and

325

seroprevalence will improve the ability to make public health decisions that effectively respond to

326

the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S.
