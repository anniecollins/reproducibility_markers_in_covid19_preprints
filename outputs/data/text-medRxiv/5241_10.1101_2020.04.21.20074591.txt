Abstract

As of April 18, 2020, 2.16 million patients in the world had been tested positive with
Coronavirus (COVID-19) and 146,088 had died, which accounts for a case fatality rate of
6.76%. In Mexico, according to official statistics (April 18), 7,497 cases have been confirmed
with 650 deaths, for a case fatality rate of 8.67%. These estimates, however, may not reflect
the final fatality risk among COVID-19 confirmed patients, because they are based on crosssectional counts of diagnosed and deceased patients, and therefore are not adjusted by time
of exposure and right-censorship. In this paper we estimate fatality risks based on survival
analysis methods, calculated from individual-level data on symptomatic patients confirmed
with COVID-19 recently released by the Mexican Ministry of Health. The estimated fatality
risk after 35 days of onset of symptoms is 12.38% (95% CI: 11.37-13.47). Fatality risks sharply
rise with age, and significantly increase for males (59%) and individuals with comorbidities
(38%-168%, depending on the disease). Two reasons may explain the high COVID-19 related
fatality risk observed in Mexico, despite its younger age structure: the high selectivity and
self-selectivity in testing and the high prevalence of chronic-degenerative diseases.

Introduction
Two important characteristics that differentiate the current COVID-19 pandemics from
recent previous outbreaks such as SARS coronavirus and H1N1 influenza are its high rate
of transmissibility and its apparently higher fatality rate (Liu et al 2020, Surveillances
2020). The rapid spread of the new infection represents a challenge for the timely
calculation of epidemiological and demographic parameters. One of these challenges is the
estimation of fatality risks.
As of April 18, 2020, 2.16 million patients in the world had been tested positive with
Coronavirus (COVID-19) and 146,088 had died, which accounts for a fatality of 6.76%. In
Mexico, according to official statistics (April 18), 7,497 cases have been confirmed with 650
deaths, for a fatality of 8.67% (Secretaría de Salud, 2020). However, these estimates may
not reflect the final fatality rates among COVID-19 confirmed patients. Given that they
are obtained from cumulative daily counts of confirmed patients and related deaths, they
do not take into consideration the different exposure times of current confirmed patients,
and therefore may be biased by right-censorship, particularly in countries in the early
stages of evolution of the epidemics, such as Mexico, which accumulate a large proportion
of recent cases.
In order to obtain unbiased estimates of fatality risk, it is necessary to consider
patients’ time of exposure from the onset of symptoms and correct the biases in exposure
1 by peer review and should not be used to guide clinical practice.

associated to right-censorship. This may be achieved through the usual methods of survival
analysis. These methods, however, require individual-level data with information about
the date of the onset of symptoms, the date of death for the deceased, and basic
demographic information.
With the exception of a handful of clinical studies (Shi et al. 2020; Zha et al. 2020;
Zhou et al. 2020) data with such characteristics are unavailable at this moment for most
countries. In the case of Mexico, the federal Ministry of Health (Secretaría de Salud)
recently made public individual-level data of patients attended in medical units across the
country who tested positive for COVID-19. This information, which is updated on a daily
basis, allows us to estimate fatality risks for COVID-19 patients using survival analysis,
as well as the possible effects of basic demographic factors, the presence of comorbidities
and the type of medical institution on the risk of death.
Data and Methods
Our analysis is based on 7,497 patients who tested positive for COVID-19 in Mexico, a
subset of a larger dataset of 49,167 patients with COVID-19 related symptoms who sought
attention in medical units and were tested with positive, negative (29,301 cases) and
pending (12,369 cases) results. The information about these patients is reported on a daily
basis to the Secretaría de Salud, which makes the integrated data available to the public
and updated daily. We use the data set released on April 18, 20201.
A first relevant characteristic of this dataset is the inclusion of the dates at the onset
of symptoms and death, which has occurred in 650 cases. Basic demographic traits such as
age and sex of the patient are also available. The data include information as well on preexisting comorbidities such as high blood pressure, diabetes, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, immunosuppression, cardiovascular diseases, obesity,
chronic kidney disease (CKD) and smoking.
Medical attention in Mexico is highly segmented according to the type of medical
institution. The data include information on the type of institution where the patient
received attention. In addition, there is an identifier indicating whether the medical unit
is a monitoring health unit for respiratory diseases (USMER), a sample of 375 clinics and
hospitals which is part of the system of Epidemiological Surveillance implemented by the
Mexican government to monitor the incidence of infectious respiratory diseases.
We use these data to estimate fatality risks associated to COVID-19 using survival
analysis methods. First, we use the life-table method (Chiang 1984, Miller 1981) to
estimate the cumulative proportion of COVID-19 related deaths at different durations
since the onset of symptoms. We define a duration of 35 days since the onset of symptoms
to obtain an estimate of the overall fatality risk.

Second, we estimate a piecewise exponential proportional hazards model (PH model)
(Blossfeld et al 2019) to estimate the independent effects of demographic characteristics,
comorbidities, and type of health institution on the fatality hazard associated to COVID19. We introduce time segments corresponding to weekly time periods since the onset of
symptoms, from week one to five. The PH model also includes a Gamma frailty term to
control for individual heterogeneity and reduce the possible bias arising for an incomplete
model specification due to unobserved variables (Paik et al 1994, Gutierrez 2002).
Results
Table 1 presents the descriptive statistics of COVID-19 patients. The median age is 46 and
58% are males. The three most frequent comorbidities are high blood pressure (20.6%),
obesity (19.4%) and diabetes (16.7%). Other comorbidities, such as asthma, cardiovascular
diseases, COPD, immune suppression, and chronic liver disease, are also frequent among
patients, with a prevalence between 2% and 10%. Overall, only half of patients do not
present comorbidities, 27.6% have one comorbidity, 14.1% two comorbidities, and 8% three
or more.

Almost half of patients (47.8%) come from medical units integrated to the sentinel
surveillance model sample (USMER); the other 52.2% were attended by other medical
units. The distribution according to the type of medical institution shows that half of
patients (49.2%) received attention by IMSS-Bienestar or the Ministry of Health, 30.7%
from IMSS, 10.9% from private clinics or hospitals and 6.8% by ISSSTE. Other type of
services account for only a small fraction of cases.

Figure 1 presents the cumulative proportion of deaths for patients of COVID-19,
according to the number of days elapsed since the onset of symptoms. These curves are
estimated using the life-table method with a correction for right-censorship. The general
curve shows a pattern of acceleration during weeks 2-3 and then a decrease after 21 days.

The estimated death risk after 35 days (Table 2) is 12.38% (95% CI: 11.37-13.47).
The risk is higher for males (14.72%, 95% CI: 13.27-16.31) than females (9.09%, 95% CI:
7.86-10.49). The risk also increases sharply with the presence of comorbidities. For patients
with no comorbidities, the estimated death risk after 35 days is 5.89%, for patients with

one comorbidity is 13.51%, with two comorbidities is 23.17%, and with three or more
comorbidities is 32.93%. There is also a positive association with age: patients with less
than 25 years of age have an estimated death risk of 0.24%, those with ages 40-44 a risk of
8.83% and those with 70+ years a risk of 37.27%.

These estimates are based on bivariate associations, so they may reflect the effects
of correlated factors not controlled in the estimation. In order to evaluate the independent
effect of each factor we estimated a piecewise exponential hazard model for the risk of a
COVID-19 related death (Table 3). As explained in the methodological section, this model
includes a gamma term for unobserved heterogeneity, which may help to reduce the biases
associated to unobserved variables.
The hazard ratios confirm the time-dependence pattern observed in the descriptive
analysis. Compared to the first week of symptoms, the estimated hazard rate increases
84% in the second week and 31% in the third week, and then reduces in half (HR 0.473) in
the fourth week and almost 75% (HR 0.253) in the fifth week.
The higher risk of a COVID-19 related fatality among confirmed male patients is
also corroborated by the model. Even after controlling by age and comorbidities, the
estimated death hazard is 59% higher for males (HR=1.589, 95% CI 329-899). The effects
of age are also positive and statistically significant. Compared to a patient between 45-49
years of age, the estimated hazard of death is 161% higher for a patient with 70+ years
(HR=2.608, 95% CI 1.931-3.522) and 96% lower for a patient under 25 years (HR=0.038,
95% CI 0.005-0.270).

Not all pre-existing comorbidities affect the hazard of a COVID-19 related death.
The model does not identify significant effects for asthma, cardiovascular disease, smoking
and “other” comorbidities. In contrast, high blood pressure increases the estimated hazard
by 38% (HR=1.378, 95% CI: 1.086-1.749), immune suppression by 70% (HR=1.696, 95%
CI: 1.148-2.505), diabetes by 73% (HR=1.730, 95% CI: 36.0-120.2), COPD by 77%
(HR=1.770, 95% CI: 1.269-2.469), obesity by 78% (HR=1.776, 95% CI: 1.415-2.231), and
chronic liver disease by 168% (HR=2.679, 95% CI: 1.789-4.014). There are no significant
interaction effects associated to the presence of two or more of these pre-existing conditions.
Finally, the estimated fatality hazard is 36% lower for patients who received
attention in non-USMED units (HR=0.644, 95% CI: 0.544-0.763). This may reflect a
negative selectivity of patients who receive attention in USMED units, which are generally
more equipped than Non-USMED units and therefore may concentrate the most severe
cases. This selectivity may also explain the higher fatality risk for patients attended by
IMSS, compared to IMSS-BIENESTAR/SSA, ISSSTE, and private institutions. However,

differences in the quality and procedures of attention between institutions cannot be
discarded, particularly to explain the larger reduction in the fatality hazard in private
institutions (HR=0.257, 95% CI: 0.170-0.386).
Conclusions
In this paper we apply survival analysis methods to estimate the COVID-19 fatality risk
and associated risk factors for symptomatic confirmed patients of COVID-19 in Mexico,
using individual-level data recently released by the Ministry of Health.
The fatality risk after 35 days of onset of symptoms estimated using the life-table
method is 12.38%, a figure considerably higher than the 8.67% obtained by the simple ratio
of deaths vs. confirmed cases. This difference is mostly explained by the right-censorship
in cross-sectional data: a considerable proportion of confirmed patients are still at risk of
death and some of them eventually will die, but they are not currently considered in the
calculation of the cross-sectional fatality rate. The fatality risk estimated with the life-table
method introduces corrections for this bias, and therefore may be closer to the final fatality
risk for symptomatic confirmed patients of COVID-19 in Mexico.
The estimated fatality hazard for symptomatic confirmed patients of COVID-19 is
higher during the second week of the onset of symptoms. It is also higher for males and
sharply increases with age. The preexistence of certain comorbidities, such as chronic
kidney disease, COPD, obesity, diabetes, immune suppression, and hypertension is also a
risk factor which significantly increases the fatality hazard. There are no significant effects
associated to cardiovascular disease, asthma, and smoking.
These results must be taken with caution because they represent only a subset of
COVID-19 cases, those with symptoms serious enough to seek medical attention and who
tested positive for the presence of the virus. Mexico has adopted a policy of restriction of
tests to such cases. Compared to other countries with significant number of COVID-19
cases, Mexico has one of the lowest number of tests per thousand (0.28, versus a median of
6.28 per thousand for a group of 50 countries with updated information up to April 18)2,
and therefore the selectivity of confirmed cases among those with serious symptoms is
likely higher than in most countries. This selectivity, along with the high prevalence of
comorbidities among the adult population, might explain the high fatality risk observed in
Mexico.
In sum, our results may be best interpreted as reflecting the fatality risks for
patients with serious symptoms who seek medical attention in Mexico, and caution must
be exercised to extrapolate them to the overall infected population or to other countries
with different epidemiological profiles or COVID-19 testing policies.
