Abstract

15

The COVID-19 pandemic has created a global crisis and the governments are fighting rigorously

16

to control the spread by imposing intervention measures and increasing the medical facilities. In

17

order to tackle the crisis effectively we need to know the trajectories of number of the people

18

infected (i.e. confirmed cases). Such information is crucial to government agencies for

19

developing effective preparedness plans and strategies. We used a statistical modeling approach

20

– extreme value distributions (EVDs) for projecting the future confirmed cases on a global scale.

21

Using the 69 days data (from January 22, 2020 to March 30, 2020), the EVDs model predicted

22

the number of confirmed cases from March 31, 2020 to April 9, 2020 (validation period) with an

24

of June 2020. Also, we have quantified the uncertainty in the future projections due to the delay

25

in reporting of the confirmed cases on a global scale. Based on the projections, we found that

26

total confirmed cases would reach around 11.4 million globally by the end of June 2020.The

27

USA may have 2.9 million number of confirmed cases followed by Spain-1.52 million and Italy-

Introduction

33

The first case of respiratory disease, pneumonia, with symptoms similar to the severe acute

34

respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was reported in Wuhan City, China in December

35

2019 [1]. A novel strain of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was

36

confirmed on January 7, 2020 [1, 2]. The novel corona virus (COVID-19), which is the seventh

37

member of the coronavirus family, along with the SARS-CoV and the middle east respiratory

38

syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) spread from animals to humans [2]. Since the reporting of

39

the zero-patient in December 2019, COVID-19 has spread dramatically worldwide and the

40

World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the outbreak as Public Health Emergency of

41

International Concern (PHEIC) on January 30, 2020 [2]. As of April 9, 2020, globally the total

42

number of confirmed, recovered, and mortality cases were 1,595,350, 353,975 and 95,455

43

respectively [3]. The reported cases globally are drastically increasing from 4,219/day in

44

February 2020 to 50,784/day in early April 2020. The trajectory of the infection spread during

45

the coming days is important information in order to plan, prepare, and scale up the intervention

measures including the medical facilities to meet the increased influx of patients and other

47

governing policies to control the transmission.

48

49

To date (as of April 9, 2020), the United States of America (USA) has the highest number of

50

affected cases (461,437), followed by Spain (153, 222) and Italy (143,626) [3]. The global case-

51

fatality rate (CFR), which is the ratio of the confirmed deaths to the confirmed cases, has

52

increased from 1.37% on January 19, 2020 to 5.95% by April 9, 2020 [4]. In contrast, the current

53

CFR of China, Japan, and Iran has either reduced or remained constant when compared to their

54

initial CFR [4]. The global CFR is however increasing continuously due to the different timing

55

of the onset of the pandemic in different countries. Overall, the number of confirmed cases has

56

been explosively increasing with time so far.

57

58

Modeling tools have been widely used to predict the COVID-19 spread to help the medical

59

professionals, policymakers, and governing bodies for implementing interventions measures to

60

control the pandemic. Since the onset of COVID-19, studies have used different mathematical

61

and dynamic stochastic transmission models to predict the transmission and intervention impacts

62

[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. However, these epidemiological models involve a number of parameters

63

that are not readily available due to the absence or lack of the data for extracting the knowledge

64

especially during the early period of the outbreak. These parameters have been either assumed or

65

adopted from previous pandemic studies and consequently the performance of these models has

66

been questioned [1, 11].

68

To address the above shortcomings of epidemiological models, we proposed a statistical

69

modelling approach, using Extreme Value Distributions (EVD) to describe the evolution of the

70

COVID-19 spread and then to generate the future projections. EVDs are used to fit series of

71

observation mainly to estimate extreme events of future that were not observed in the past.

72

Though application of EVDs are very common in earth sciences to model the unusual events,

73

recently, EVDs are applied in health care sector and shown to produce promising results [12].

74

75

One of the main challenges in simulating and projecting the COVID-19 spread trajectory is the

76

delay in reporting (Rd) which is the lag time between onset of symptoms of the disease and date

77

of reporting [13]. The delay in reporting may vary due to various reasons such as delay in (i)

78

reporting at the hospital, (ii) diagnostics, (iii) reporting the confirmed cases in databases etc.

79

Also, Rd imposes high uncertainty in estimating the spread trajectory and thus excluding Rd in

80

modeling analysis could lead to unrealistic projections with underestimation in the projected

81

confirmed cases [9]. Very few studies have considered Rd in their modeling studies to estimate

82

the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 and reported an average Rd value of 7.6 days and 6.1

83

days [9,13].

84

85

Therefore, for quantifying the uncertainty in projected cases, we have estimated the fold increase

86

in the confirmed cases due to Rd. Thus, the key contributions of the study are (i) using EVD

87

theory for the projection of COVID-19 cases, (ii) incorporating Rd value to estimate the

88

uncertainty in future projections, and (iii) global scale projection of confirmed and death cases.

Materials and Method

91

We collected the daily time series of the number of confirmed and death cases from John

92

Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering [3] for 177 countries, out of

93

which only 42 countries (refer S1 table) that exceeded 1000 confirmed cases (as on March 30,

94

2020) were considered for the analysis. These 42 countries spread across different continents

95

except Antarctica and accounts for 96.5% of the total confirmed cases globally as on March 30,

96

2020. We observed that majority of the countries with significant number of confirmed cases are

97

from Europe and Asia followed by North America and South America.

99

countries short listed based upon a minimum threshold of 1000 confirmed cases)

100

101

Though the number of COVID-19 infected cases were reported even before January 22, 2020 in

102

China especially in the Hubei province, we have not considered that data in the analysis since the

103

COVID-19 outbreak has been contained and extensive research studies have already been

104

conducted [14, 15, 16, 17].

105

106

Application of extreme value distribution has already been explored to model the mortality and

107

morbidity rate associated with pneumonia, influenza and cardiovascular diseases in the public

108

health planning [12, 18]. Therefore, in this paper, we have explored the applicability of EVDs in

109

modeling the confirmed COVID-19 cases. Initial statistical analysis of the data revealed that the

110

critical stage of COVID-19 outbreak largely has no trend in the number of people being infected

111

and therefore the use of EVDs are justified. Among the EVDs, three-parameter distributions such

112

as Generalized Extreme Value (GEV), Generalized Pareto (GP), and Generalized Likelihood

113

(GL) distributions were explored. The parameters of these distributions mainly define the

114

characteristics such as scale, shape and location of the data being fitted using the EVDs. The tail

115

behaviour of the distribution is described by the shape parameter which is estimated from higher

116

order moments, and precise estimation of shape parameter is often computationally difficult [19,

117

20] and requires suitable moment estimation approaches. Among several methods (i.e. the

118

method of likelihood and the probability weighted moments) for estimating the distribution

119

parameters, the L-moment method has been demonstrated to be more effective in estimating the

120

shape parameters and hence used in this study [21]. As many existing literatures elaborately

121

describe the mathematical description about the extreme value distributions and L-moment

122

methods, the detailed explanations are not provided in this paper.

123

124

Conventionally, EVDs have often been applied in the extreme statistical analysis, which

125

estimates the quantities corresponding to specific return periods or probabilities. In this analysis,

126

the sample data from the population are expected to be independent and identically distributed.

127

In the extreme statistical analysis for natural extreme events such as flooding, earthquake, and

128

tsunami, the annual maximum values are often considered. We observed that in the case of

129

COVID-19, the daily recorded confirmed cases are independent with no trend. Thus, the reported

130

confirmed COVID-19 cases were fitted using the EVDs to project the number of future

131

confirmed cases.

132

133

In general, the reported cases on any given days were lower than the actual infected cases due to

134

various reasons including the delay in the onset of acute symptoms, inefficiency in the testing

135

methods, lack of sufficient testing facilities etc. There is also significant risk of Covid-19 patients

136

to be tested positive after initially being tested negative due to the inaccuracies in testing and

137

latent symptoms [22]. However, government authorities mainly health care professionals should

138

be aware and be informed about the discrepancy between the reported and actual infected cases

139

to effectively tackle the current COVID-19 situations. Thus, we also estimated the fold increase

140

in the number of confirmed cases due to the delay in reporting. To account the effect of the delay

141

in reporting on the confirmed cases, we considered a Reporting delay (Rd) of 1 to 7 days and

142

have proposed a simple statistical lagging approach to estimate the fold increase in the number of

143

confirmed cases. For this analysis, the ratio

144

the previously lagged date Ct-lag were computed using the complete data having n data points.

145

The mean value of the fold increase was estimated from the ratios (For example, lag of 5 days

146

will have n-5 number of ratios) for each Rd. Furthermore, the estimate of the fold increase (with

147

its uncertainty) was coupled with the future projection of the confirmed cases for quantifying

148

associated uncertainty in the projection. Note that other than Rd, no other sources of uncertainty

149

such as incubation period, communal spread, the effects of lockdown or other containment

150

strategies, healthcare capacity, etc. were included in our study.

Statistical tests and model performance

153

The daily number of the confirmed cases from the selected 42 countries were computed from the

154

reported cumulative data. These data were further processed with the modified Mann-Kendall

155

test to check for the presence of non-parametric trend and we found that there is no trend in the

156

entire dataset. This proves that the data are statistically independent and identically distributed

157

during the critical stage of pandemic situation. Hence, we applied extreme value distribution to

158

model the available data as well as to project the COVID-19 cases.

159

160

As mentioned earlier, three different EVDs were explored to fit the datasets for the numbers of

161

confirmed cases. The root mean squared error (RMSE) computed for each distribution against

162

observation for all datasets are plotted in the boxplot (Fig 1). It is evident from Fig 1 that all the

163

three distributions (GEV, GP and GL) performed equivalently. Furthermore, the fitting

164

performance was slightly improved when using the GP distribution compared to GEV and GL

165

distributions and in particular the GP performed consistently well across all the datasets. In

166

addition, large variations in the estimated distribution parameters (i.e., location, scale, and shape

167

parameters) were identified. The results of parameter variations of GP have been shown in S2

168

Fig. These variations would reflect the variations in the statistical characteristics of the datasets

169

of different countries. As these models are data specific with parameters not having direct

170

physical meaning, it is hard to link the behaviour of parameters with the modelled variables.

171

Since we observed better performance and lower RMSE using GP distribution, in this study, we

172

are projecting the estimates of confirmed cases for selected countries using the GP models.

Although the outbreak had started in the beginning of January 2020 in Wuhan, China, majority

180

of the countries started experiencing new cases in the beginning of March 2020. All these

181

demonstrates the different timing of the onset of the spread in different countries. However, we

considered same period (January 22, 2020 to March 30, 2020) for the model calibration which in

183

turn resulted a uniform data length of all the selected countries for estimating the parameters of

184

distribution.

185

186

The model performance has been validated by comparing the model’s projections and the

187

confirmed cases observed for the selected countries for the period of 10 days (March 31 – April

188

9, 2020). The mean and standard deviation of the resulting percentage error (i.e. ratio of

189

difference between observed minus projected to observed cases) has been shown in Fig 2. Please

190

note that the positive and negative value of mean of the percentage error indicates under and

191

overestimate of the projected value, respectively. From Fig 2, it is evident that the mean and

192

standard deviation of the percentage error are within the ±5% and ±10% respectively for most of

193

the countries, and the overall performance of model is quite satisfactory for majority of the cases

194

except few. The poor performance of model for few countries, for example Germany, Australia,

195

and Iran, might be due to high variation in the infected cases. As more data is available in future,

196

more critical validation of these models can be performed to bring additional insights on the

197

reliability of the model projection.

202

Further, the model was also validated using the projection at global scale. As shown in Table 1,

203

the projections of the confirmed cases are very close to actual value with slight over estimation

204

and the increasing trend is captured well. As mentioned earlier, more data is required to validate

205

the global scale long term projection of model. However, the long-term projection of deaths

206

estimated using these model projections are very close to the projection reported by IHME for

207

the countries such as United States of America (USA) and United Kingdom (UK) [23].

Projection of COVID-19 confirmed cases

212

We observed two main behavioural changes in the number of confirmed cases curves (Fig 3). (i)

213

plateau-peak shift: number of confirmed cases in the USA, Australia, and Italy has plateaued

214

(with approximately 10 cases) soon after the beginning until last week of February 2020 and

215

increased to peak thereafter. A possible reason could be an inflow of passengers soon after the

216

Chinese New Year [24]. (ii) cross-over during March 2020: though the number of confirmed

217

cases around end of February 2020 (approximately 10 cases) was almost similar for the USA,

218

Australia, Italy, and Iran, Australia’s number of confirmed cases were less when compared with

219

the USA, Italy, and Iran during March 2020. The USA’s number of confirmed cases, though

220

lesser than Italy and Iran during the first three weeks of March 2020, has surpassed the cases of

221

Italy and Iran during the end of third week of March 2020 and stayed at peak thereafter. The

222

possible explanation for this behaviour could be attributed to the difference in intervention

223

measures imposed in the respective countries. However, it is important to note that, testing

224

capacity might be one of the keys which dictate the success of non-medical measures such as

225

social-distancing and lockdown to contain the virus [25].

226

227

Note that due to the limited observed data for fitting the model, the error in the future projection

228

is expected to be high and increases with time. Thus, the projection was made till June 30, 2020

229

(three months from March 30, 2020). Along with the estimate of probability, the shape, scale and

230

location parameters of GP distribution were used to project the confirmed cases for the future

231

period. Fig 3 shows the estimate of the number of confirmed cases for the present and future (up

232

to June 30, 2020) for the most affected country of each continent. In Chile and South Africa,

233

during the first week of March 2020, fewer (i.e. around 10 cases) confirmed cases were reported;

234

then an exponential increase was clearly seen during the subsequent weeks. Although number of

235

daily confirmed cases show randomness, the varying pattern across different countries were

236

similar.

237

238

As of June 30, 2020, the numbers of the confirmed cases for Italy, Iran, Australia, South Africa

239

and Chile would reach around 1,281,708, 479,531, 76,795, 23,281, and 44,041 respectively. The

240

number of the confirmed cases for the USA would likely to be at least more than one million

241

(highest among all the countries) in the early May 2020, though the initial progression of the

242

number infected was much lower than other highly affected countries such as Italy and Iran.

243

Similar behaviour in the number of projected confirmed cases was observed for the other less

244

affected countries such as India (refer S3 Fig), however, with less magnitude mainly because of

245

delay in onset of disease spread (early March 2020) and reporting of cases. Majority of the

246

countries (mostly developing and under-developed) at the onset of surging increase in COVID-

247

19 spread would neither be equipped with testing facilities nor have the medical infrastructure to

248

tackle the crisis [26]. Therefore, the availability of more data in the forthcoming days would help

249

in producing a more reliable projection of the confirmed cases in the future.

Note that these projections did not explicitly include the effect of the actual stringent control

257

measures (eg. social distancing, travel bans, isolation/quarantine, lockdown) adopted in the

258

various countries at local/regional and national level. However these projections might vary and

259

the number of actual confirmed cases could be less if all the countries apply inter and intra

260

circuit breaking measures (control measures) to reduce the COVID-19 spread. From the

261

projection across the world on June 30, 2020 as illustrated in Fig. 4, 17 thousand (17k) to 3000

262

thousand (3000k) number of confirmed cases were observed across different countries since

263

January 22, 2020. The maximum number of confirmed cases between 1522k and 2906k were

264

observed in the USA and Spain. Following that Italy and Germany are likely to have more than 1

265

million confirmed cases.

266

267

Globally the total number of confirmed cases would reach 11.4 million by the end of June 2020.

268

Several countries will exceed one million COVID-19 infections within the next two months. For

269

example, USA with the highest number of confirmed cases globally will be the first to reach the

270

one million count in the first week of May, followed by Spain and Italy in the first week of June

271

2020. We also estimated that Germany and France will also exceed a million cases in the middle

272

and end of June respectively. Countries like Iran, UK, Chile and Portugal are also identified to be

273

at high risk since confirmed cases in these countries will exceed half a million by the end of June

274

2020.

276

The current number of the confirmed cases in India is still in the range of few thousands and the

277

future projection is estimated to be around 28,028, which is considerably lesser than the USA

278

and the UK. However currently in India, stringent measures such as 42 days nation-wide

279

lockdown has been imposed to control and stabilize the communal spread in order to prevent

280

from becoming a global hotspot of COVID-19. It is difficult to project realistic estimates for

281

countries like India and Indonesia due to lack of sufficient data which is attributed to the delay in

282

onset of COVID-19 (first week of March 2020). However, upon getting more data with time, our

283

model could be used to project more realistic values.

284

285

In other countries including Japan and South Korea that were severely affected but imposed

286

many preventive measures, would likely to have 23k and 118k confirmed cases respectively.

287

However, the number of confirmed cases might still be reduced depending on the effectiveness

288

of the preventive measures. Please refer S4 Table for the country-wise estimates of projected

289

confirmed cases.

The rate of increase in the projected confirmed cases were estimated at the end of each months

297

(i.e. April, May and June 2020) including the actual confirmed case (March). This daily rate of

298

confirmed cases was computed from estimating the difference between the cumulative confirmed

299

cases at each month interval and dividing by the total number of days (one month in this case)

300

using the projection of 42 countries. The rate of increase falling in the box (i.e. 25 to 75

301

percentiles) indicates that in several countries, the impact would be less as the number of

302

confirmed cases per day ranges between few thousand for the projection period varying from

303

April 2020 to June 2020. However, a very high rate of increase in confirmed cases were found

304

in USA, Spain, Italy and Germany followed by France, Iran and UK.

Besides the projection of confirmed cases, we also estimated the likely number of deaths. CFR is

310

commonly used to estimate the risk of death due to any infectious disease. Please note that

311

though CFR (usually represented as percentage of the ratio of confirmed cases to confirmed

312

deaths) is not constant and changes with the context (e.g., it can vary with time, age and the

313

characteristics of infected population, etc.)[4], it can give an approximate estimate of the number

314

of deaths [4, 27, 28, 29].

316

We estimated the average value of the CFR for the selected 42 countries (from March 15, 2020

317

to March 30, 2020) and found the CFR values as 9%, 8%, 7%, 6%, 5% and 2% for the countries

318

Italy, Indonesia, Iran, Spain, UK, France and USA respectively. Based on these CFR estimates

319

along with the model projection for the confirmed cases (Fig 6), we estimated the likely number

320

of deaths on June 30, 2020 and found the number of deaths to be highest in Italy (115,354) and

321

Spain (91,340). The number of deaths in countries such as USA, Iran, France and UK are also

322

likely to be high with 58,110, 33,567, 30,490 and 20,116 deaths respectively by the end of June

323

2020. Refer S5 Table5 for the estimated number of deaths of other countries having CFR greater

324

than 1 percent. Our estimate especially for USA (82,638 deaths by the end of July 2020) is very

325

close with the number of deaths projected by the IHME health service utilization forecasting

326

team (81,114 deaths) [12].

Estimating fold increase due to the delay in reporting confirmed
cases

335

Effective lag length is a key variable to estimate the fold increase due to delay in reporting. As

336

different countries follow different testing procedure and also the capacity of health care systems

337

largely varies between the countries, the results of confirmed cases on any day is lower than the

338

actual number of people infected. We varied the minimum and maximum lag length of 1 and 7

339

days respectively to analyse the impact of delay on number of confirmed cases. Fig 7 is plotted

340

between the number of days delayed and the number of folds increase in the confirmed cases for

341

the selected countries across the world. The mean estimate of fold increase was calculated for

342

each day lag (Fig 7). It is well known as illustrated in Fig 7 that increasing the number of days

343

delay elevates the magnitude of fold increase. The fold increase of 16 and 10 would reach for the

344

delay of 7 days in the context of extreme scenario as currently Italy and USA respectively are

345

facing (Fig 7a). In specific, a steep increase was found when the lag length (i.e. delay in

346

reporting) is more than 5 days. Therefore, it is to be noted that sooner the case is identified and

347

reported, better the preventive measures could be ensured without much communal spread [30].

348

Further, we noticed that although USA is experiencing high surge in confirmed cases, the fold

349

increase for even 1-week delay was considerably less compared to other countries. Perhaps this

350

observation is likely to change as more data will be available. This is a positive point that USA

351

can manage the situation if adequate preventive measures are in place. Overall, it was observed

352

that many of the European countries exhibited similar results. As shown in Fig 7b, though the

353

magnitude of fold increase seems comparatively low in less affected countries, it might increase

354

when the number of confirmed cases increases. Therefore, this is a right time for them to enforce

355

preventive measures to safeguard people from COVID-19.

Assumptions, limitations, and quantification of uncertainty

362

The uncertainties associated with the epidemic modeling studies are due to various reasons such

363

as (i) availability, length, and correctness of the data [31], (ii) model parameter values: either

364

assumed or estimated or adopted from previous modeling studies (assumption of incubation

365

period and reproduction number) [32, 33] (iii) assumptions or limitations of the model being

366

used. For example, the SEIR model assumes all the population is susceptible to infection.

367

Dynamics transmission model’s assumption that symptomatic individuals are more (50%)

368

susceptible to infection than asymptomatic individuals [32]. Assumptions while conceptualizing

369

the non-pharmaceutical interventions such as duration of stay at home during isolation, percent

370

contact reduction in workplaces, impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions are constant with

371

time and same across all countries etc. [32].

372

373

As mentioned earlier, the uncertainty in the projected confirmed cases were quantified only

374

based on the Rd, and the fold increase estimated from each data point for a fixed lag length will

375

have inherent variability (Fig. 8). This is mainly because the data is highly random and during

376

the initial phase of pandemic the effect of delay will be less and gradually increase with time.

377

Although the mean estimate as reported in the previous section is a good choice to quantify the

378

delay effect in the projection, ignoring the uncertainty might under predict the likely estimate of

379

future period. Therefore, we estimated 95% confidence interval from the estimate of fold

380

increase. From the lag length period of 1 to 7 days, we considered on an average of 3- and 5-days

381

lag based on the delay in reporting to estimate the range of variation in the projection especially

382

in the confirmed cases. We chose Australia, randomly, to illustrate the impact of uncertainty in

383

the projection (Fig 8). It is evident from Fig 8 that the median projected confirmed cases and

384

uncertainty increases with time. For example, the median projected confirmed cases increased

385

from 6,958 on March 30 2020 to 108,447 on 30 June 2020 for Rd of 3 days. Similarly, the width

386

of uncertainty band for projected confirmed cases on 31 March 2020 was 6,596-7,593 (upper

387

bound – lower bound) while it has increased to 102,816-118,357 on June 30 2020. Refer Table 2

388

for median and CI intervals for selected seven countries.

389

390

It is expected that the unbiased estimate of uncertainty band will have the median estimate closer

391

to the mid-portion of the band. In other words, any deviation from this mid-portion of the band

392

represents the bias in the uncertainty estimate. However, we found the median falling towards

393

the upper bound in most of the countries mainly due to the drastic increase in number of cases

394

with during the critical period. As shown earlier in Fig 7, the delay in reporting increases the

395

fold-increase in confirmed cases which in turn will significantly increase the projection range as

396

well as the uncertainty (Table 2).

This study explored the (i) applicability of EVDs in predicting the COVID-19 confirmed cases,

407

USA would have the highest number of confirmed cases of 2,905,522 (4,795,011-5,971,468 for

408

Rd= 3 days) and Iceland to have the minimum number of confirmed cases of 21,166 (27222-

409

58,008 for Rd= 3 days) by June 30, 2020. The number of deaths has also been estimated for the

410

42 countries and found that the deaths to be maximum in Italy (115,354 deaths) followed by

411

Spain (91,340) by June 30, 2020.

412

413

It may be noted that we have not considered any intervention measures (i.e. lockdown, social

414

distancing, school closures etc.,) in the model rather we focused on projecting the actual trend

415

exist in the data, thereby informing the likely increase in number of confirmed cases due to

416

COVID-19 outbreak. As inferred from this study, the reporting delay should be minimized to get

417

more accurate information on the confirmed cases. Therefore, the uncertainty due to delay in

418

reporting should not be ignored in the projection in order to estimate the reliable number of

419

confirmed cases. However, future studies will include other sources of uncertainty such as

420

model, parameter and input for the more realistic projection. The projected confirmed cases are

421

based on the data collected until March 30, 2020. However, we will be updating the model

projection once in every two weeks and our results will be posted in twitter handle
