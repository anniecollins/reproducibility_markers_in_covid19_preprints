ABSTRACT

2

Vigorous non-pharmaceutical interventions have largely suppressed the COVID-19

3

outbreak in Wuhan, China. We extended the susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered

4

model to study the transmission dynamics and evaluate the impact of interventions

5

using 32,583 laboratory-confirmed cases from December 8, 2019 till March 8, 2020,

6

accounting for presymptomatic infectiousness, and time-varying ascertainment rates,

7

transmission rates, and population movements. The effective reproduction number R0

8

dropped from 3.54 (95% credible interval: 3.41-3.66) in the early outbreak to 0.27

9

(0.23-0.32) after full-scale multi-pronged interventions. By projection, the

10

interventions reduced the total infections in Wuhan by 96.1% till March 8. Furthermore,

11

we estimated that 87% infections (lower bound: 53%) were unascertained, potentially

12

including asymptomatic and mild-symptomatic cases. The probability of resurgence

13

was 0.33 and 0.06 based on models with 87% and 53% infections unascertained,

14

respectively, assuming all interventions were lifted after 14 days of no ascertained

15

infections. These results provide important implications for continuing surveillance and

16

interventions to eventually contain the outbreak.

1

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 was detected in

2

Wuhan, China, in December 2019.1 Many early cases were connected to the Huanan

3

Seafood Market, which was disinfected on January 1, 2020 to stop potential zoonotic

4

infection.2 Nevertheless, the high population density of Wuhan together with the

5

increased social activities before the Chinese New Year catalyzed the outbreak in

6

January, 2020. The massive human movement during the holiday travel season

7

Chunyun, which started on January 10, further expedited spreading of the outbreak.3

8

Shortly after the confirmation of human-to-human transmission, the Chinese authorities

9

implemented the unprecedented cordons sanitaire of Wuhan on January 23 to contain

10

the geographic spread, followed by a series of non-pharmaceutical interventions to

11

reduce virus transmission, including suspension of all intra- and inter-city

12

transportation, compulsory mask wearing in public places, cancelation of social

13

gatherings, and home quarantine of mild-symptomatic patients.4 From February 2, strict

14

stay-at-home policy for all residents, centralized isolation of all patients, and centralized

15

quarantine of suspected cases and close contacts were implemented to stop household

16

and community transmission. Furthermore, a city-wide door-to-door universal

17

symptom survey was carried out during February 17-19 by designated community

18

workers to identify previously undetected symptomatic cases. Details of the

19

interventions were described in Pan et al.4 These drastic interventions, together with

20

the improved medical resources and healthcare manpower from all over the country,

21

have effectively bent the epidemic curve and reduced the attack rate in Wuhan,

22

shedding light on the global efforts to control the COVID-19 outbreak.4

23
24

Recent studies have revealed important transmission features of COVID-19, including

25

infectiousness of asymptomatic cases5-9 and presymptomatic cases.10-12 Furthermore,

26

the number of ascertained cases was much smaller than those estimated by earlier

27

modeling-based studies using international cases exported from Wuhan prior to the

28

travel suspension,3,13,14 implying a substantial number of unascertained cases. Using

29

reported cases from 375 cities in China, a modeling study concluded that substantial

unascertained cases, despite having lower transmissibility, had facilitated the rapid

2

spreading of COVID-19.15 In addition, accounting for the unascertained cases has

3

refined the estimation of case fatality risk of COVID-19, leading to a better

4

understanding of the clinical severity of the disease.16 Modeling both ascertained and

5

unascertained cases is important to facilitate interpretation of transmission dynamics

6

and epidemic trajectories.

7
8

Based on comprehensive epidemiological data from Wuhan,4 we extended the

9

susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model to delineate the full spectrum

10

of COVID-19 outbreak in the epicenter, accounting for presymptomatic infectiousness,

11

unascertained cases, population movement, and different intervention strengths across

12

time periods (Fig. 1). We named the extended model SAPHIRE, because we

13

compartmentalized

14

presymptomatic, 𝐴 unascertained, 𝐼 ascertained, 𝐻 isolated, and 𝑅 removed

15

individuals. Compared with the classic SEIR model, we explicitly modeled population

16

movement3 and split the infectious cases into 𝑃, 𝐴, and 𝐼 to reflect infectiousness at

17

different stages. The unascertained compartment 𝐴 was expected to mostly consist of

18

asymptomatic and mild-symptomatic cases who were infectious but difficult to detect.

19

We introduced compartment 𝐻 because ascertained cases would have shorter effective

20

infectious period due to isolation in the hospital, especially when medical resources

21

were improved.

We chose to model the outbreak from January 1, 2020 and divided it into five time

periods based on key events and interventions: January 1 to 9 (before Chunyun),

25

January 10 to 22 (Chunyun), January 23 to February 1 (cordons sanitaire), February 2

26

to 16 (centralized isolation and quarantine), and February 17 to March 8 (community

28

daily inbound and outbound travelers (500,000 before Chunyun, 800,000 during

29

Chunyun, and 0 after cordons sanitaire).3 Furthermore, we assumed transmission rate

and ascertainment rate did not change in the first two periods, because few interventions

2

were implemented before January 23, while they were allowed to vary in later periods

3

to reflect different intervention strengths. We used Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)

4

to estimate these parameters by assuming the daily incidence following a Poisson

5

distribution, while the other parameters were set based on previous epidemiological

6

investigations2,10 or from our data (Methods). We assumed the transmissibility of

7

presymptomatic/unascertained cases to be 0.55 of the ascertained cases.15,17

8
9

We first simulated epidemic curves with two periods to test the performance of our

10

parameter estimation procedure (Methods). We converted the transmission rate to the

11

effective reproduction number 𝑅0 and focused on evaluating the estimation of 𝑅0

12

and the ascertainment rate 𝑟 in both periods, for which the parameter values were

13

different. As shown in Extended Data Figs. 1-2, our method could accurately estimate

14

𝑅0 and the ascertainment rates when the model was correctly specified and was robust

15

to misspecification of the duration from symptom onset to isolation and the relative

16

transmissibility of presymptomatic/unascertained cases to ascertained cases. As

17

expected, estimates of 𝑅0 were positively correlated with the specified latent period

18

and infectious periods, while the estimated ascertainment rates were positively

19

correlated with the specified ascertainment rate in the initial state (Extended Data Fig.

20

2). These simulation results highlighted the importance of carefully specifying

21

parameter values and designing sensitivity analyses based on information from existing

22

data and literature.

24

Based on confirmed cases exported from Wuhan to Singapore, we conservatively

25

estimated the ascertainment rate during the early outbreak in Wuhan was 0.23 (95%

26

confidence interval [CI]: 0.14-0.42) (Methods). We then applied our model to fit the

27

daily incidences in Wuhan from January 1 to February 29, assuming the initial

28

ascertainment rate was 0.23, and used the fitted model to predict the trend from March

29

1 to 8. As shown in Fig. 2A, our model fit the observed data well, except for the outlier

on February 1, which might be due to approximate-date records of many patients

2

admitted to the field hospitals set up after February 1. After a series of multi-faceted

3

public health interventions, the transmission rate decreased from 1.31 (95% credible

4

interval [CrI]: 1.25-1.37) in the first two periods to 0.40 (0.38-0.42), 0.17 (0.16-0.19),

5

and 0.10 (0.08-0.12) in the later three periods, respectively (Extended Data Table 5),

6

which could be translated into 𝑅0 of 3.54 (3.41-3.66), 3.32 (3.20-3.44), 1.18 (1.11-

7

1.25), 0.51 (0.47-0.54) and 0.27 (0.23-0.32) for the five periods, respectively (Fig. 2B,

8

Extended Data Table 6). We estimated the cumulative number of infections, including

9

unascertained cases, till March 8 to be 257,406 (207,683-315,785) if the trend of the

10

fourth period was assumed (Fig. 2C), or 812,930 (599,992-1,087,944) if the trend of

11

the third period was assumed (Fig. 2D), or 6,302,928 (6,277,193-6,327,431) if the trend

12

of the second period was assumed (Fig. 2E), in comparison to the estimated total

13

infections of 248,022 (199,474-302,464) by fitting data from all five periods (Fig. 2A).

14

These numbers were translated to 3.6%, 69.5%, and 96.1% reduction of infections due

15

to the interventions in different periods.

16
17

Strikingly, we estimated low ascertainment rates across periods, which were 0.15 (0.13-

18

0.17) for the first two periods, and 0.14 (0.12-0.17), 0.10 (0.08-0.12), and 0.16 (0.13-

19

0.21) for the other three periods, respectively (Extended Data Table 4). Even with the

20

universal community symptom screening implemented on February 17 to 19, the

21

ascertainment rate was only increased to 0.16. Based on the fitted model using data

22

from January 1 to February 29, we projected the cumulative number of ascertained

23

cases to be 32,562 (30,234-34,999) by March 8, close to the actual reported number of

24

32,583. This was equivalent to an overall ascertainment rate of 0.13 (0.11-0.16) given

25

the estimated total infections of 248,022 (199,474-302,464). The model also projected

26

that the number of daily active infections in Wuhan, including both ascertained and

27

unascertained, peaked at 55,651 (45,204-67,834) on February 2 and dropped afterwards

28

to 683 (437-1,003) on March 8 (Fig. 2F). If the trend remained unchanged, the number

29

of ascertained infections would first become zero on March 25 (95% CrI: March 18 to

April 2), while the clearance of all infections would occur on April 21 (April 8 to May

2

11), 2020 (Extended Data Table 7). The first day of zero ascertained case in Wuhan

3

was reported on March 18, which was on the lower 95% CrI of our prediction,

4

indicating that control measures might have been enhanced in March.

5
6

The large fraction of unascertained cases has important implications for continuing

7

surveillance and interventions.18 Based on stochastic simulations, we estimated the

8

probability of resurgence after lifting all controls, assuming the transmission rate,

9

ascertainment rate, and daily population movement were resumed to values of the first

10

period (Methods). Because of the latent, presymptomatic, and unascertained cases, the

11

source of infection would not be completely cleared shortly after the first day of zero

12

ascertained cases. We found that if control measures were lifted 14 days after the first

13

day of zero ascertained cases, despite sparse new cases might be ascertained during the

14

observation period, the probability of resurgence could be as high as 0.97, and the surge

15

was predicted to occur on day 36 (95% CrI: 28-48) after lifting controls (Fig. 3). If we

16

were to impose a more stringent criterion of lifting controls after observing no

17

ascertained cases in a consecutive period of 14 days, the probability of resurgence

18

would drop to 0.33, with possible resurgence delayed to day 43 (95% CrI: 34-58) after

19

lifting controls (Fig. 3). These results highlighted the risk of ignoring unascertained

20

cases in switching intervention strategies, despite using an over-simplified model

21

without considering other factors such as imported cases, changes in temperature and

22

humidity, and a stepwise lifting strategy that is currently adopted by Wuhan and other

23

cities in China.

24
25

We performed a series of sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of our results by

26

smoothing the outlier data point on February 1, varying lengths of latent and infectious

27

periods, duration from symptom onset to isolation, ratio of transmissibility of

28

presymptomatic/unascertained cases to ascertained cases, and initial ascertainment rate

29

(Extended Data Tables 4-7, Extended Data Figs. 4-11). Our major findings of

1

remarkable decrease in 𝑅0 after interventions and the existence of substantial

2

unascertained cases was robust in all sensitivity analyses. Consistent with simulation

3

results, the estimated ascertainment rates were positively correlated with the specified

4

initial ascertainment rate. When we specified the initial ascertainment rate as 0.14 or

5

0.42, the estimated overall ascertainment rate would be 0.08 (0.07-0.10) and 0.23 (0.19-

6

0.28), respectively (Extended Data Table 4, Extended Data Figs. 9-10). If we

7

assumed an extreme scenario with no unascertained cases in the early outbreak (model

8

S8; Extended Data Fig. 11), the estimated ascertainment rate would be 0.47 (0.38-0.57)

9

overall and 0.58 (0.45-0.73) for the last period, which would represent an upper bound

10

of the ascertainment rate. In this model, because of the higher ascertainment rate

11

compared to the main analysis, we estimated a lower probability of resurgence of 0.06

12

when lifting controls after 14 days of no ascertained cases, and a longer time to

13

resurgence, occurring on day 41 (95% CrI: 31-56) after lifting controls (Fig. 3). We also

14

tested a simplified model assuming complete ascertainment anytime, but this simplified

15

model performed significantly worse than the full model, especially in fitting the rapid

16

growth before interventions (Extended Data Fig. 12).

17
18

Our finding of a large fraction of unascertained cases, despite the strong surveillance in

19

Wuhan, indicated the existence of many asymptomatic or mild-symptomatic but

20

infectious cases during the outbreak, highlighting a key challenge to the COVID-19

21

epidemic control.19 There is accumulating evidence on the existence of many

22

asymptomatic cases. For example, asymptomatic cases were estimated to account for

23

18% of the infections onboard the Diamond Princess Cruise ship7 and 31% of the

24

infected Japanese evacuated from Wuhan.8 In addition, it was reported that 29 of the 33

25

(88%) infected pregnant women were asymptomatic by universal screening of 210

26

women admitted for delivery between March 22 and April 4 in New York City.9 Several

27

reports also highlighted the difficulty in detecting COVID-19 cases: about two thirds

28

of the cases exported from mainland China remained undetected worldwide,20 and the

29

detection capacity varied from 11% in low surveillance countries to 40% in high

surveillance countries.21,22 By modeling the epidemics in other cities, it was also

2

estimated that the ascertainment rate of infected individuals was about 24.4% in China

3

(excluding Hubei province)14 and 14% in Wuhan prior to travel ban.15 Consistent with

4

these studies, our extensive analyses of the most comprehensive epidemic data from

5

Wuhan also indicated an overall ascertainment rate between 7% and 28% (Extended

6

Data Table 4, excluding the extreme scenario of model S8). These results were also

7

consistent with emerging serological studies, showing much higher seroprevalence than

8

the reported case prevalence in different regions of the world.23,24 The large fraction of

9

unascertained cases would lead to about one month delay between the first occurrence

10

of no ascertained cases and the clearance of all infections (Extended Data Table 6),

11

imposing a high risk of resurgence after lifting controls (Fig. 3). Therefore,

12

understanding the proportion of unascertained cases and the asymptomatic

13

transmissibility will be critical for prioritization of the surveillance and control

14

measures.18,25 Currently, Wuhan is implementing a strategy to normalize and restore

15

societal activities gradually while maintaining strong disease surveillance. The

16

experience and outcome of Wuhan will be valuable to other countries who will

17

eventually face the same issue.

18
19

In the absence of interventions, 𝑅0 is the basic reproduction number, which is a key

20

measurement of the virus transmissibility. We noted that our 𝑅0 estimate of 3.54 (3.41-

21

3.66) before any interventions was at the higher end of the range of 𝑅0 estimated by

22

other studies using early epidemic data from Wuhan (1.40-6.49 with a median of

23

2.79).2,14,15,26-28 Several plausible reasons might explain the discrepancy, including

24

potential impact of unascertained cases, more complete case records in our analysis,

25

and different time periods analyzed. If we considered a model starting from the first

26

COVID-19 case reported in Wuhan (Extended Data Fig. 13), from which we estimated

27

a lower 𝑅0 of 3.38 (3.28-3.48) before January 23, 2020, similar to the value of 3.15

28

reported by a recent study.27 Nevertheless, this reproduction number was still much

29

higher than the earlier estimates and those for SARS and MERS,29,30 featuring another

challenge to control the spread of COVID-19.

2
3

Taken together, our modeling study delineated the full-spectrum dynamics of the

4

COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, and highlighted two key features of the outbreak: a high

5

proportion of asymptomatic or mild-symptomatic cases who were difficult to detect,

6

and high transmissibility. These two features synergistically propelled the global

7

pandemic of COVID-19, imposing grand challenges to control the outbreak.

8

Nevertheless, lessons from Wuhan have demonstrated that vigorous and multifaceted

9

containment efforts can considerably control the size of the outbreak, as evidenced by

10

the remarkable decrease of 𝑅0 from 3.54 to 0.27 and an estimated 96.1% reduction of

11

infections till March 8. These are important information for other countries combatting

12

the outbreak.

13
14

Some limitations of our study should be noted. First, we need field investigations and

15

serologic studies to confirm our estimate of the ascertainment rate, and the

16

generalizability to other places is unknown. This may depend on the detection capacity

17

in different locations.22 Second, due to the delay in laboratory tests, we might have

18

missed some cases and therefore underestimated the ascertainment rate, especially for

19

the last period. Third, we excluded clinically diagnosed cases without laboratory

20

confirmation to reduce false positive diagnoses, which, however, would lead to lower

21

estimates of ascertainment rates, especially for the third and fourth periods when many

22

clinically diagnosed cases were reported.4 The variation in the estimated ascertainment

23

rates across periods reflected a combined effect of the evolving surveillance,

24

interventions, medical resources, and case definitions across time periods.4,31 Fourth,

25

our model assumed homogeneous transmission within the population while ignoring

26

heterogeneity between groups by sex, age, geographic regions and socioeconomic

27

status. Furthermore, individual variation in infectiousness, such as superspreading

28

events,32 is known to result in a higher probability of stochastic extinction given a fixed

29

population 𝑅0 .33 Therefore, we might have overestimated the probability of resurgence.

Finally, we could not evaluate the impact of individual interventions based on the

2

epidemic curve from a single city, because many interventions were applied

3

simultaneously. Future work by modeling heterogeneous transmission between

4

different groups and joint analysis with data from other cities will lead to deeper insights

on the effectiveness of different control strategies.27,34

Data of COVID-19 cases in Wuhan

3

Detailed description of the data can be found in Pan et al.4 Briefly, information of COVID-19 cases from

4

December 8, 2019 till March 8, 2020 were extracted from the municipal Notifiable Disease Report

5

System on March 9, 2020. Date of symptom onset (the self-reported date of symptoms such as fever,

6

cough, or other respiratory symptoms) and date of confirmed diagnosis were collected for each case. For

7

the consistency of case definition throughout the periods, we only included 32,583 laboratory-confirmed

8

cases who were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by the real-time reverse-transcription-polymerase-

9

chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay or high-throughput sequencing of nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens.

Estimation of ascertainment rate using cases exported to Singapore

12

As of May 10, 2020, a total of 24 confirmed COVID-19 cases in Singapore were reported to import from

13

China, among which 16 were imported from Wuhan before the cordons sanitaire on January 23

14

(Extended Data Table 1). Based on VariFlight Data (https://data.variflight.com/en/), the total number

15

of passengers from Wuhan to Singapore between January 18 and 23, 2020 was 2,722. Therefore, the

16

cumulative infection rate among the passengers was 0.59% (=16/2722, 95% CI: 0.30-0.88%). These

17

cases had symptom onset from January 21 to 30, 2020. In Wuhan, a total of 12,433 confirmed cases were

18

reported to have symptom onset in the same period, equivalent to a cumulative infection rate of 0.124%

19

(95% CI: 0.122–0.126%) by assuming a population size of 10 million for Wuhan. By further assuming

20

complete ascertainment of early cases in Singapore, which is well known for excellent surveillance

21

strength,21,22 the ascertainment rate in Wuhan was estimated to be 0.23 (95% CI: 0.14–0.42),

22

corresponding to 0.77 (95% CI: 0.58-0.86) of the infections being unascertained during the early outbreak

23

in Wuhan. This represents a conservative estimate for two reasons: (1) the assumption of perfect

24

ascertainment in Singapore ignored potential asymptomatic cases;7,8 and (2) the number of imported

25

cases with onset between January 21 and 30 was censored due to suspension of flights after Wuhan

26

lockdown. We used these results to set the initial value and the prior distribution of ascertainment rates

27

in our model.

2

(𝑃), unascertained cases (𝐴), and case isolation in the hospital (𝐻). We chose to analyze data from January

3

1, 2020, when the Huanan Seafood Market was disinfected, and thus did not model the zoonotic force of

4

infection. We assumed a constant population size 𝑁 = 10,000,000 with equal number of daily inbound

5

and outbound travelers 𝑛, where 𝑛 = 500,000 for January 1-9, 800,000 for January 10-22 due to

Parameter settings and initial states

3

Parameter settings for the main analysis were summarized in Extended Data Table 2. We set 𝛼 = 0.55

4

according to Li et al.15, assuming lower transmissibility for presymptomatic and unascertained cases. We

5

assumed an incubation period of 5.2 days and a presymptomatic infectious period of 𝐷𝑝 = 2.3 days.2,10

6

Thus the latent period was 𝐷𝑒 = 5.2 − 2.3 = 2.9 days. Because presymptomatic infectiousness was

7

estimated to account for 44% of the total infections of ascertained cases,10 we set the total infectious

8

period as (𝐷𝑝 + 𝐷𝑖 ) =

9

set a long isolation period of 𝐷ℎ = 30 days, but this parameter has no impact on our fitting procedure

10

and the final parameter estimates. The duration from symptom onset to isolation was estimated to be

11

𝐷𝑞 = 21, 15, 10, 6, and 2 days as the median time length from onset to confirmed diagnosis in each

12

period, respectively.

𝐷𝑝
0.44

= 5.2 days, thus the symptomatic infectious period was 𝐷𝑖 = 2.9 days. We

13

Based on the settings above, we specified the initial state of the model on December 31, 2019

14

(Extended Data Table 3). The initial number of ascertained symptomatic cases 𝐼(0) was specified as

15

the number of ascertained cases with onset during December 29-31, 2019. We assumed the initial

16

ascertainment rate was 𝑟0 , and thus the initial number of unascertained cases was 𝐴(0) =

17

𝑟0−1 (1 − 𝑟0 )𝐼(0). We denoted 𝑃𝐼 (0) and 𝐸𝐼 (0) as the numbers of ascertained cases with onset during

18

January 1-2, 2020 and during January 3-5, 2020, respectively. Then, the initial numbers of exposed cases

19

and presymptomatic cases were set as 𝐸(0) = 𝑟0−1 𝐸𝐼 (0) and 𝑃(0) = 𝑟0−1 𝑃𝐼 (0) , respectively. We

20

assumed 𝑟0 = 0.23 in our main analysis based on the point estimate using the Singapore data (described

21

above).

22
23

Estimation of parameters in the SEIR model

24

Considering the time-varying strength of control measures, we assumed 𝑏 = 𝑏12 and 𝑟 = 𝑟12 for the

25

first two periods, 𝑏 = 𝑏3 and 𝑟 = 𝑟3 for period 3, 𝑏 = 𝑏4 and 𝑟 = 𝑟4 for period 4, and 𝑏 = 𝑏5 and

26

𝑟 = 𝑟5 for period 5. We assumed the observed number of ascertained cases with symptom onset on day

27

𝑑 , denoted as 𝑥𝑑 , followed a Poisson distribution with rate 𝜆𝑑 = 𝑟𝑃𝑑−1 𝐷𝑝−1 , where 𝑃𝑑−1 was the

28

We repeated the stochastic simulations for all 10,000 sets of parameter values sampled by MCMC to

construct the 95% CrI of the epidemic curve by the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles at each time point.

Prediction of epidemic ending date and the risk of resurgence

15

Using the stochastic simulations described above, we predicted the first day of no new ascertained cases

16

and the date of clearance of all active infections in Wuhan, assuming continuation of the same control

17

measures as the last period (i.e., same parameter values).

18

We also evaluated the risk of outbreak resurgence after lifting control measures. We considered

19

lifting all controls (1) at 𝑡 days after the first day of zero ascertained cases, or (2) after a consecutive

20

period of 𝑡 days with no ascertained cases. After lifting controls, we set the transmission rate 𝑏 ,

21

ascertainment rate 𝑟, and population movement 𝑛 to be the same as the first period, and continued the

22

stochastic simulation to stationary state. Time to resurgence was defined as the number of days from

23

lifting controls to when the number of ascertained cases 𝐼 reached 100. We performed 10,000

24

simulations with 10,000 sets of parameter values sampled from MCMC (as described above). We

25

calculated the probability of resurgence as the proportion of simulations in which a resurgence occurred,

26

as well as the time to resurgence conditional on the occurrence of resurgence.

Simulation study for method validation

To validate our method, we performed two-period stochastic simulations (Eqs. 10-16) with transmission

rate 𝑏 = 𝑏1 = 1.27 , ascertainment rate 𝑟 = 𝑟1 = 0.2, daily population movement 𝑛 = 500,000, and

2

duration from illness onset to isolation 𝐷𝑞 = 20 days for the first period (so that 𝑅0 = 3.5 according

3

to Eq. 8), and 𝑏 = 𝑏2 = 0.41, 𝑟 = 𝑟2 = 0.4, 𝑛 = 0, and 𝐷𝑞 = 5 for the second period (so that 𝑅0 =

4

1.2 according to Eq. 8). Lengths of both periods were set to 15 days, and the initial ascertainment rate

5

was set to 𝑟0 = 0.3, while the other parameters and initial states were set as those in our main analysis

6

(Extended Data Tables 2-3). We repeated stochastic simulations 100 times to generate 100 datasets. For

7

each dataset, we applied our MCMC method to estimate 𝑏1 , 𝑏2 , 𝑟1 and 𝑟2 , while setting all other

8

parameters and initial values the same as the true values. We translated 𝑏1 and 𝑏2 into (𝑅0 )1 and

9

(𝑅0 )2 according to Eq. 8, and focused on evaluating the estimates of (𝑅0 )1 , (𝑅0 )2 , 𝑟1 and 𝑟2 . We also

10

tested the robustness to misspecification of the latent period 𝐷𝑒 , presymptomatic infectious period 𝐷𝑝 ,

11

symptomatic infectious period 𝐷𝑖 , duration from illness onset to isolation 𝐷𝑞 , ratio of transmissibility

12

between unascertained/presymptomatic cases and ascertained cases 𝛼, and initial ascertainment rate 𝑟0 .

13

In each test, we changed the specified value of a parameter (or initial state) to be 20% lower or higher

14

than its true value, while keeping all other parameters unchanged. When we changed the value of 𝑟0 , we

15

adjusted the initial states 𝐴(0), 𝑃(0), and 𝐸(0) according to Extended Data Table 3.

16

For each simulated dataset, we ran the MCMC method with 20,000 burn-in iterations and an

17

additional 30,000 iterations. We sampled parameter values from every 10 iterations, resulting in 3,000

18

MCMC samples. We took the mean across 3,000 MCMC samples as the final estimates and displayed

19

results for 100 repeated simulations using boxplots.

Sensitivity analyses for the real data

22

We designed nine sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of our real data results. For each of the

23

sensitivity analyses, we fixed parameters and initial states to be the same as the main analysis except for

24

those mentioned below.

25

(S1) Adjust the reported incidences from January 29 to February 1 to their average. We suspect the spike

26

of incidences on February 1 might be caused by approximate-date records among some patients

27

admitted to the centralized quarantine after February 2. The actual illness onset dates for these

28

patients were likely to be between January 29 and February 1.

Extended Data Fig. 13. Estimation of R0 using daily incidence data starting from
December 9. Following the main analysis, we assumed 𝑟0 = 0.23 and set 𝐼(0) = 1,
𝐴(0) = 3 , 𝐸(0) = 17 and 𝑃(0) = 𝐻(0) = 𝑅(0) = 0 accordingly. We assumed
transmission rate 𝑏 , ascertainment rate 𝑟 , and duration from illness onset to
hospitalization 𝐷𝑞 (set to 21 days) were the same until January 22, 2020. All the other
settings were the same as in the main analysis. The shaded area in the plot indicates 95%
CrIs estimated by the deterministic model with 10,000 sets of parameter values sampled
from MCMC. Unlike other analyses, we did not construct 95% CrIs by stochastic
simulations, because stochastic fluctuations at the early days would have extremely
large impacts due to low counts, leading to unreasonable CrIs. The inserted histogram
shows the distribution of the estimated R0 from December 9, 2019 to January 22, 2020,
for which the mean estimate was 3.38 (95% CrI: 3.28-3.48).
