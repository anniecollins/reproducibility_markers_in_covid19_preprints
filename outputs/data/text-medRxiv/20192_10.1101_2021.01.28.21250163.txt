Abstract
Background COVID-19 patients have severe lung injury. The USWD could play a supportive
role in relieving lung injury and enhance clinical recovery. Methods and findings The design
was a single-center, evaluator blinded; 2-arm parallel design superiority randomized controlled
clinical trial. Moderate and severe coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) positive patients with acute
respiratory syndrome, Fifty patients were randomized (USWD, 25; control, 25) between
February 18/2020 and April 20/2020. There were male 22 (44.0%) and female 28 (56.0%) with
mean (SD) age 53(10.69). Time to clinical recovery (USWD 36.84 vs control 43.56, P = 0.03)
was significantly shortened with a between-group difference of 6.72 days. The median SIRS
score at day 28 was 0 (0-1) in the USWD group, while 0 (0-2) in the control group ( P = 0.011),
and the seven-point scale at day 28 showed significant improvement in the USWD group (P =
0.003). While the rate of RNA negative conversion at day 7 (2/25 vs 7/25, p=0.054), day 14
(14/25 vs 18/25 p=0.239), day 21 (22/25 vs 18/25 p=0.279), and day 28 (25/25 vs 22/25 p=0.730)
did not show statistical significance. Similarly, no significant differences were observed in the
AI-assisted CT analysis. No treatment-associated adverse events or worsening of pulmonary
fibrosis were found. Conclusions Among the 50 moderate and severe COVID-19 patients, the
USWD as an adjunctive therapy to standard therapy could shorten the recovery course and
enhance clinical improvement without aggravating pulmonary fibrosis. However, the study did
not report statistical significance in the negative conversion rates of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid
due to the small sample size and early termination, the findings of this study are limited.

Introduction
The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has prompted efforts to manage the threat to the wellbeing of populations worldwide.1,2,3,4 The second wave of the COVID-19 epidemic has emerged
in some countries 5, however to date, no effective treatment for COVID-19 has been confirmed.
In response to the critical demand for high-quality clinical guidance at the extreme point of the
outbreak in China, guidelines have been published to clarify the role that physical therapy can
play in managing COVID-19.6,7,8,9 Suggestions have also been made that supportive therapies
such as ultra-short-wave diathermy (USWD) perform functions to boost the immune responses
and inhibit inflammation.10,11,12,13
Although USWD has been used in the field of physical therapy and rehabilitation for many
decades

, the evidence for its application as part of COVID-19 management is debatable.10

14,15,16

During the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), USWD was employed widely
by rehabilitation professionals in China, to reduce pneumonia inflammation. Zhang group
evaluated the efficacy of both USWD and conventional therapy in 38 SARS patients, where
USWD was used as an adjuvant treatment in addition to standard therapy. The study concluded
that using USWD could accelerate recovery and reduced the lengths of hospital stay.17
Although the pathogens of COVID-19 and SARS are both coronaviruses, the clinical
manifestation, death rate, and pathological changes especially fibrosis are different. High-quality
evidence to recommend the application of USWD in pulmonary conditions is still lacking, while
there is a complete absence of evidence on the use of USWD in COVID-19 because of its novel
nature. The scant evidence for the USWD safety and efficacy makes its application in clinical
settings questionable. Herein we designed a randomized controlled trial to investigate the clinical
efficacy and safety of USWD in managing COVID-2019.

Methods
Trial design and ethical issues
This single-center, evaluator-blinded, 2-arm (1:1 ratio) parallel design superiority randomized
controlled trial was approved by the ethics committee of Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical
College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China (certificate of
approval number TJ-C20200127) and prospectively registered on February 17, 2020, with the
Chinese Clinical Trials Registry (Identifier: ChiCTR2000029972). The study was conducted
following the relevant regulations and guidelines of good clinical practice, and the Helsinki
Declaration. Patient recruitment, randomization, and study events are visually described in the
CONSORT flow diagram (Figure 1). Participants were recruited from February 18/2020 through
April 20/2020. Before randomization, written and verbal informed consent was taken from every
patient and an informative essay that clearly shows the risks and the supposed benefits
accompanying the participation was provided to each patient.

Participants
Patients of all genders with an age range from 18 to 65 diagnosed positive for SARS-CoV-2 by
nasopharyngeal swabs were recruited from the Tongji Hospital of Huazhong University of
Science and Technology (Wuhan, China). Patients meeting all of the following criteria were
included: (1) those aged 18 to 65 years, (2) Positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test by
nasopharyngeal swabs, (3) Chest CT showed multiple patchy ground-glass shadows or other

typical manifestations in both lungs. The exclusion criteria were (1) Positive tests for other
pathogens such as Tuberculosis, Mycoplasma, (2) People with metal implants or pacemakers, (3)
Patients with respiratory failure or requiring mechanical ventilation, (4) Patients with multiple
organ failure who need ICU monitoring and treatment, (5) Those having a bleeding tendency or
active bleeding in the lungs, (6) Those with shock, (7) Cancer patients and those with severe
underlying diseases, (8) Patients with severe cognitive impairment,(9) Pregnant or lactating
women, (10) Those without signed informed consent, (11) Those with other contraindications to
short wave diathermy.

Randomization, allocation, and blinding
A statistician who was not part of the study created an online randomization plan on
www.randomization.com using the permuted blocks method with small blocks of various sizes.
A total of 50 patients were randomized to either an experimental, USWD group (n=25) or a
control group (n=25). This was an assessor-blinded controlled study, due to the nature of the
interventions, the study could not be therapist or patient blinded; however, a well-trained health
care team consisting of two evaluators, two statisticians, and two data collectors were blinded to
the groups/treatment allocation. The outcomes were independently documented based on mutual
consensus between the data collectors(Fig 1).

Sample size

A Priori sample size calculation was performed with GPower 3.1(software (Düsseldorf,
Nordrhein-Westfalen, Germany) based on the mean values for our primary variable, length of
recovery from symptoms, from a previously published SARS study.17 We estimated that with an
80% power, 5% two-sided type I error rate, and an effect size of 0.72, the enrolment of 62
participants would be enough to detect a statistically significant between-group difference of 6.6
days in the length of recovery from symptom. Moreover, 4 participants were added to the total
sample size to manage the expected 5% dropouts, making the total sample size 66 (each group
33 participants).

Intervention
The experimental group (USWD group) received the nationally recommended standard medical
treatment in addition to the USWD. The USWD was performed through the application of the
ultra-short-wave therapy electrodes on the anterior and posterior parts of the trunk for 10 minutes,
twice a day for 12 consecutive days. The Ultra short wave therapy machine specifications and
details are as follows: ultrashort-wave electrizers (Dajia DL-C-C, factory no ： BE1003094,
A.C.power 220V, 50Hz, 700VA, Shantou Medical Equipment Factory co., Ltd, China,
Guangdong). We applied USWD in continuous mode with a frequency of 27.12MHz and power
of 200w, with these parameters the patient would feel a mild or no heat. On the other hand, the
control group only received the nationally recommended standard treatment. Moreover, the
testing of USWD machine output, disinfection of the machine and electrodes, wearing masks,
protective suit, and testing the patient's skin sensation before the intervention were done to
ensure the treatment safety.

Outcomes Measures
The primary outcome measures were the length of recovery from symptoms measured by 7category ordinal, and SIRS scale (Appendix in supplement 1), and a negative conversion rate of
the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test by RT-PCR. The secondary outcome measures included vital
signs assessment, treatment adverse effects, Computed Tomography (CT) imaging and AIassisted analysis, the length of stay in the hospital, and blood test including Complete blood
count (CBC), Creatine kinase (CK), Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), serum glutamic pyruvic
transaminase (SGPT), serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), and international
normalized ratio (INR). The primary and secondary variables were measured at baseline, after 7
days, 14 days, 21 days, and 28 days of treatment. However, in this trial, we didn’t perform CT
scans very frequently due to radiation hazards.
The criteria of clinical recovery were (1) Temperature returned to normal for more than 3 days:
(2). Respiratory symptoms (such as cough, and breathing difficulty) improved significantly; (3).
Lung CT imaging showed a significant decrease in acute exudative lesions; (4). Two consecutive
negative nucleic acid tests by nasopharyngeal swabs (the sampling interval was at least 24 hours).

Data collection tools
The data collection forms developed for this trial were consisting of medical history forms for
taking a relevant medical history, Case Report Form (CRF) to collect treatment-related data,
adverse events form to collect data regarding any adverse event happening during the trial.

Statistical analysis

We planned to enroll 66 participants according to our protocol, however, due to the
unavailability of COVID-19 patients later in our hospital, we had to close our study early on 50
patients. All the statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS (Statistical Package for social
sciences, version 25.0) and Graphpad Prism 8. Intention to treat analysis was used. Data
normality was assessed with the Kolmogorov Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk tests. Continuous
variables are presented as mean (SD) in case of the normal distribution of data or median (IQR)
in case of non-normal distribution, while the categorical variables were presented as count (%).
Descriptive statistics (mean, frequencies, and percentages) were calculated for demographic
variables, primary, and secondary variables of the study. Baseline and post-intervention
comparison between the USWD and control group was performed using independent samples ttest and Mann–Whitney statistics based on normality results of the data. The proportions of
categorical variables were compared using Fischer’s exact test /chi-square tests. Chi-square test
was used for the evaluation of the Seven-point scale, and Mann–Whitney test was used in the
SIRS scale (treated as ordinal scales). A Difference-in-difference (D-in-D) analysis was used for
analyzing the AI-assisted CT scans data. Patients who failed to reach the negative conversion of
SARS–CoV–2 by the cut-off date of the analysis were considered as right-censored at the last
visit date. All the patients were treated after completion of follow-up duration (28 days).

Among 50 enrolled participants, there were 22 (44.0%) male and 28 (56.0%) female participants.
The mean (SD) age was 53±10.69. Most of the participants were non-smokers (86.0%), and
34.0% were having comorbid conditions, with the most common coexisting diseases as diabetes
(22%), hypertension (20%), cardiovascular diseases (8%). Fever (90%), breathing difficulty
(56%), dry cough (50%), diarrhea (34%), and fatigue (24%) were the top 5 common symptoms
reported on presentation. Moreover, it is worth noting that most patients were having a dry cough
(50%), while very few were having productive cough (14% only). CT findings showed more
severe patients in the USWD group (52%) than in the control group (28%) but the baseline
difference was not significant (Table 1).

Baseline and Other Characteristics of the Participants
The baseline clinical characteristics of all participants are given in Table 2. Both of the groups
were balanced at the baseline with significant differences in demographic data, clinical features,
laboratory tests, and CT scan of the lung.

Primary Outcomes
The time to clinical recovery (days) in the USWD group was significantly shortened than the
control group (36.84±9.93 vs 43.56±12.15, P = 0.037). The SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test
negative conversion rate showed no significant difference between the USWD and control group
at day 7 (P = 0.054), day14 (P = 0.239), day 21 (P = 0.279), and day 28 (P = 0.730) (Table 3).

Secondary Outcomes
Clinical Outcomes
The SIRS scores which reflect the patient’s present clinical condition (including heart and
respiratory rate, mean arterial pressure, SpO2 %, body temperature, white blood cells, and level
of consciousness) showed a statistically significant difference between the two groups at day 7 (P
= 0.030), day14 (P = 0.002), day 21 (P = 0.003), and day 28 (P = 0.011). Likewise, the sevenpoint scale after intervention at day 14, day 21, day 28 also showed significance (P = 0.046,
0.001, 0.003), however, the difference at day 7 was insignificant (P = 0.371). These findings
reveal the therapeutic efficacy of USWD in COVID-19 patients (Table 3).

CT Scan Outcomes
The CT images in figures 2 and 3 depict the treatment progress of moderate and severe cases
from both groups, through the entire interventional period. Artificial intelligence (AI) aided CT
images (AI-aided CT) analysis system was adopted for quantitative analysis of the infected lung
area proportion and volume before and after treatment. The mean values for different CT scan
parameters for the total population before and after treatment are given in Table 4. The lower
lung had the worst infective conditions, on CT both groups improved in infected lung area
proportion and volume. A comparison of AI-assisted quantitative analysis of CT scan images
before and after treatment between the control and USWD group showed no significant
differences (Table 5 and Figure 3 ).

Adverse Events and Complications
No serious AEs, deaths, permanent disability, neoplasia, or empyrosis cases were registered
during the trial. In the USWD group 14/15 cases of pulmonary fibrosis recovered, one had no
change in fibrosis, similarly in the control group 16/18 cases of fibrosis recovered, and two had
no changes in fibrosis. No worsening of pulmonary fibrosis was observed in both groups. Out of
50, 22 in USWD and 22 in the control group were having complications such as abnormal liver
function test (LFTs) (52% vs 48%, P = 0.777), electrolyte imbalance (32% vs 44%, P = 0.382),
hyperfibrinogenemia (44% vs 48%, P =0.777), and mild anemia (32% vs 52%, P = 0.152). The
blood routine investigation showed all parameters in almost equal and in the normal range in
both groups. However, the WBCs were significantly low in the USWD group (USWD 5.51±1.38
vs control 6.56±1.97 ), on the other hand, the median monocyte count was significantly higher in
USWD (USWD group 8.92 (2.20) vs control group 7.10 (1.15)), the difference was statistically
significant but of uncertain clinical importance.
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first randomized clinical trial investigating the USWD treatment of
COVID-19 (a search of PubMed and MEDLINE on 31 October 2020 for publications in all
languages using the keyword COVID-19 revealed no published USWD randomized clinical
trials). In this randomized clinical trial, we systematically investigated the safety and therapeutic
efficacy of USWD in patients with moderate or severe COVID-19. There was a significant
shortening in the length of recovery (36.84±9.93 vs 43.56±12.15, P =0.037) and improvement in
the mean scores of the clinical scales, including SIRS and the Seven-point scale after a 12 days
course of USWD/twice per day.

The USWD enhances fibroblast activity.18 Fibroblasts are oxygen-sensitive 19, and it is theorized
that the synergistic activity of USWD and high oxygen environment in COVID-19 patients could
cause or aggravate pulmonary fibrosis. Interestingly we did not observe any worsening of
pulmonary fibrosis in this study. On the contrary, fibrosis was alleviated in 14 out of

15

patients

in USWD and 16 out of 18 patients in the control group after treatment.
In this study, we didn’t find that USWD enhances the SARS-CoV-2 negative conversion rate,
suggesting that USWD exerts therapeutic function doesn’t depend on the direct antivirus effect.
The ultra-shortwave diathermy (USWD) generates radiations of 27.12 MHz. When applied in
continuous mode, USWD could induce vasodilation, enhance cellular activity, and reduce
inflammation and pain. Our findings are consistent with the study of Zhang et al. They hired
USWD in 2003 during the SARS over 38 patients, the study outcomes showed significant
improvements with USWD used as an adjuvant treatment with drug therapy. Utilizing USWD
accelerated the recovery and shortened the duration of hospital stay.17 Many other studies on
pneumonia patients treated with USWD have produced similar results about clinical recovery as

On the other hand, although within the normal range, the USWD had raised the number of

reducing the number of white blood cells which is a marker of inflammation, these findings in
our study are consistent with previous studies of the physiological effects of short waves therapy,
supporting the immune response to accelerate the recovery. Our findings are in agreement with
Bazett et al. findings, revealing that USWD could significantly increase the activity of
leukocytes in performing phagocytosis and sticking to the vessel walls which supports the
possibility that using USWD at an early stage in pneumonia could stimulate and boost the natural
defenses of the body against the microorganisms.23,24
Lung CT scan is providing supportive assistance in the early diagnosis and recovery monitoring
of lung lesions in COVID-19. The AI-aided CT analysis could be used to identify the severity of
patients and triage scientifically 25, data has proven the reliability of artificial intelligence (AI)
AI-aided CT quantification of lung lesion in COVID-19.26
We attempted to do AI-aided CT analysis in order to compare the treatment effects on lung
involvement between the two groups in our study. The CT quantitative analysis showed no
significant differences in USWD and control group, however, in most of the patients, the fibrosis
observed before treatment was recovered (USW=14/15 recovered, control group 16/18
recovered). The fibrosis recovery result could completely allay the concerns about the safety of
USWD. These results show a promising improvement upon using USWD in COVID-19 patients
who were hospitalized and needed supplemental oxygen therapy. However, due to the early
termination of the study and the small sample size, the findings of this study could be limited.
Conclusion
The USWD as adjunctive therapy to standard therapy shortens the course of moderate and severe
COVID-19 without aggravating pulmonary fibrosis. Based on the observed beneficial clinical

effects and no adverse effects of USWD, we recommend the use of USWD as an adjunct to
standard therapies in COVID-19 patients. We suggest studies with a larger sample size to
confirm our findings and explore the USWD benefits further.
Strengths and limitations
This study had some strengths and limitations. It is the first randomized controlled trial
addressing the safety and efficacy of USWD in COVID-19 patients conducted in Tongji Hospital,
which is compliant with good clinical practices. However, this study had some limitations,
including the early termination, small sample size, and single-center design.
Clinical Messages
•The USWD as adjunctive therapy shortened the recovery course and improved the clinical
status of COVID-19 patients without obviously adverse events.
•Negative SARS-CoV-2 conversion rate didn’t improve in the USWD group, suggesting USWD
exert therapeutic effect doesn’t depend on direct antivirus activity.

Moderate cases in control group(a-d) :Multiple ground glass opacity(GGO) in both lower
lungs, with local thickening and adhesion of bilateral pleura at baseline, whlie GGO
significantly absorbed, streak shadows were also lighter, pleural thickening and adhesions were
alleviated in week 4. Moderate cases in USWD group(e-h) : Bilateral scattered GGO in the
lower lungs, with grid shadows and striae foci visible inside, obvious near the pleura, and local
pleural adhesions were obsersed at baseline, while bilateral scattered GGO showed lightened
with a significant decrease in week4. Bilateral local pleural slight adhesion. Severe cases in
control group(i-l): Bilateral multiple GGO, accompanied by consolidation shadows and a few
cord lesions, near the pleura. while GGO still existed with slight alleviation. No obvious changes
in consolidation shadows, grid shadows, and cord lesions but some pulmonary fibrosis in week
4. severe cases in USWD group(m-p) Bilateral multiple GGO, and striped shadows,
accompanied by bronchial inflation, and local thickening and adhesion of the pleuraat baseline,
while obviously alleviated in week 4. Moreover, the bronchial inflation disappeared, along with
slightly thickened and adherent pleura, and little pulmonary fibrosis and consolidation.

Supplement 1 Appendix
Systemic Inflammatory Response scale (SIRS)
Systemic Inflammatory Response scale (SIRS) is used for evaluation of clinical improvement based on heart rate,
mean arterial pressure(MAP mmHg), respiratory rate/min, blood oxygen saturation (SpO2 %), body temperature
（℃）, white blood cells (WBC *109/L), blood glucose (mmol/L) and level of consciousness (Aware/awake,
Lethargy or irritability, shallow coma, coma, brain death). All these parameters, except" Level of consciousness" are
assigned a score from 0 to 4 based on the actual values recorded from the patient corresponding to the range of
values in the table below. For the level of consciousness: Aware/awake (0), Lethargy or irritability (1), Shallow
coma (2), coma (3), brain death (4).

Total score :

The 7-category ordinal
The 7-category or 7-point ordinal scale is consisting of seven separate categories. The categories range from 1-7, 7
corresponds to death; category 6 patients need ICU hospitalization, require ECMO and invasive mechanical
ventilation; category 5 patients need ICU hospitalization but do not require ECMO and/or invasive mechanical
ventilation; category 4 patients are non-ICU hospitalized patients, requiring supplemental oxygen; category 3
patients are also non-ICU hospitalized patients, but they do not require supplemental oxygen; category 2 patients are
not hospitalized, but unable to resume normal activities; category 1, not hospitalized with the resumption of normal
activities.
