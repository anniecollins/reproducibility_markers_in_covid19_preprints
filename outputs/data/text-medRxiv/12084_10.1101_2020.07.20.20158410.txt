Abstract
SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies confer protective immunity against reinfection. We
have developed a rapid test for screening SARS-CoV-2 neutralization antibodies using
genome-free virus-like particles incorporated with a small luciferase peptide, HiBiT. Their
entry into LgBiT-expressing target cells reconstitutes NanoLuc luciferase readily detected by
a luminometer. This newly developed HiBiT-tagged Virus-like particle-based Neutralization
Test (hiVNT) can readily quantify SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies within three hours
with a high-throughput in a low biosafety setting. Moreover, the neutralizing activity
obtained from hiVNT was highly consistent with that measured by the conventional
neutralization test using authentic SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, antibody responses to both
viral spike and nucleocapsid proteins correlated with the neutralization activity assessed by
hiVNT. Our newly-developed hiVNT could be instrumental to survey individuals for the
presence of functional neutralizing antibody against SARS-CoV-2.

Introduction
Due to the unavailability of any specific countermeasure, the constantly spreading COVID19 pandemic could only be partially and temporarily slowed down by implementing regional
lockdowns that force people to stay at home and prevent their movement. With the
progression of the pandemic, a considerable subset of the population would have acquired
post infection immunity and tests that reveal the post infection immune status of individuals
are the need of the hour. A credible test which accurately identifies the protected can offer an
immunity passport for the individual to be freed from the lockdown and resume routine
activities without the fear of getting infected. At present, the semi-quantitative neutralization
test (NT) and the quantitative plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) which identifies
the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) are the only foolproof
methods available for this purpose. However, practical feasibility of these highly specific

tests is weighed down by drawbacks such as; low throughput, long turnaround time (TAT)
and the need for a specialized laboratory setup with biosafety level 3 (BSL3) facilities to
handle the live viruses used in these tests 1.
To overcome these hurdles, pseudovirus-based NT 2, surrogate serodiagnostic tests
(sVNT) 3, and single cell RNA sequencing 1 are being studied. However, a simple, convenient,
rapid and high-throughput test capable of directly detecting nAbs with high specificity which
could act as an ideal alternative to the neutralization assay is yet to be developed4. Virus-like
particles (VLPs) are self-assembling, non-replicating, nonpathogenic entities of similar size
and conformation as that of infectious virions. VLPs can be generated to possess the surface
proteins of any kind of viruses on their membrane devoid of the viral nucleic acids. This
genome-free feature of VLPs overrides the need for BSL3 facilities while handling, but has
the drawback of difficulty in quantifying its cell entry and membrane fusion.
HiBiT is an 11 amino acid peptide tag that can be attached to any protein-of-interest.
LgBiT, the counterpart of NanoLuc luciferase is complementary to HiBiT and binds to the
latter to produce a highly active luciferase enzyme. HiBiT tagged proteins can be easily
detected and quantified based on bioluminescence using the Nano-Glo assay system. HiBiT
technology offers the advantages of high sensitivity, convenience of a single-reagent-addition
step and short TAT of only a few minutes.
In this report, we have developed a HiBiT-VLP-based neutralization test (hiVNT)
that can readily detect SARS-CoV-2 nAbs. The assay system utilizes VLPs bearing SARSCoV-2 spike protein on their surfaces, incorporated with HiBiT-tagged HIV-1 capsid protein.
Fusion of these VLPs could be readily monitored and quantified using VeroE6/TMPRSS2
cells stably expressing LgBiT as target cells. This system retains the specificity of
neutralization assays while overcoming all the pitfalls, as hiVNT can be instrumental to
measure protective immunity against viral invasion and evaluate vaccine efficacy by rapid,
high-throughput quantification of nAb in a BSL2 laboratory.

Results
To establish a rapid quantitative cell-based neutralization assay using luminescence-tagged
VLPs, we inserted the HiBiT tag to the HIV-1 Gag-Pol protein, a minimal subunit to produce
VLPs (Fig. 1A). After testing several prototypes, we found that HiBiT tag insertion at the Cterminal region of the capsid gene in Gag-Pol performed best. HiBiT tag can bind with high
affinity to its complementary larger subunit LgBiT, and form luciferase (NanoLuc) 5. As
expected, HiBiT-containing VLPs (hereafter designated as hiVLP-SARS2) could emit light
upon addition of recombinant LgBiT and Furimazine substrate. As the capsid antigen carried
the HiBiT tag, the luminescence intensity correlated with the amount of capsid antigen (Fig.
1B). By co-transfecting Gag-Pol-HiBiT and SARS-CoV-2 spike expression vectors, we
generated hiVLP-SARS2 and confirmed their expression in cell and virus lysates (Fig. 1C).
Since SARS-CoV-2 can infect VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells with high efficiency 6, we
next generated LgBiT-expressing VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells. We noticed a robust increase in
NanoLuc activity when the LgBiT-expressing VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells were treated with
hiVLP-SARS2 for 3 hours (Fig. 1D, E). We further demonstrated the drop in luminescence
signals upon pretreatment with a TMPRSS2 inhibitor (Camostat mesylate) and also with antiSpike neutralizing monoclonal antibody (Fig. 1F), suggesting that hiVLP-SARS2 enters the
target cells through the interactions between viral spike and cellular receptors in a similar
way as that of authentic SARS-CoV-2.
We next tested whether our newly developed hiVLP-SARS2 system could detect
nAbs in the serum of COVID-19 patients. The neutralization assay was carried out in
accordance with the following steps. VeroE6/TMPRSS2-LgBiT cells were seeded on 96-well
white polystyrene plates at a density of 104 cells/well one day prior to inoculation.
Decomplemented sera derived from convalescent COVID-19 patients were mixed with
hiVLP-SARS2 and the mixture was inoculated to VeroE6/TMPRSS2-LgBiT cells. Three
hours later, the cells were washed with PBS and measured for their NanoLuc luminescence.

We found that all the patients’ sera tested could block the entry of hiVLP-SARS2 in varying
degrees (Fig. 2A), suggesting the presence of nAbs against SARS-CoV-2. We thus developed
the hiVLP-SARS2-based Neutralization Test (hiVNT). Two convalescent sera and one
healthy donor serum were tested by hiVNT and authentic SARS-CoV-2 NT only to show that
all the samples gave similar results in both tests (Fig. 2B), suggesting that hiVNT
performance is in concordance with the NT using authentic SARS-CoV-2.
Since surrogate antibody detection is being widely studied as an alternative to NT,
we wanted to check the correlation of nAbs detected by hiVNT with antibody titers detected
by ELISA. We matched the results of hiVNT against the antibody titers detected by ELISA
in 74 COVID-19 positive sera. nAb levels were found to correlate with IgG antibodies against
both the spike and the nucleocapsid proteins (Fig 3A), but not with IgM (Fig. 3B). Taken
together, our novel hiVNT could be useful for rapid detection of nAbs in the sera of
individuals recovered from COVID-19.

Discussion
We have developed the hiVNT, a novel platform to rapidly detect and quantify SARS-CoV2 nAbs using genome-free VLPs and HiBiT technology. The assay principle is similar to
conventional neutralization assays and is based on viral entry and membrane fusion with
measurement of NanoLuc luciferase activity to simplify the outcome. Considering the
drawbacks of NT and PRNT, tests that may confer immunity passport to individuals are the
need of the hour and different platforms are being exploited for this purpose, even though
more detailed serological studies are needed.
Pseudovirus-based NTs are the popular alternatives to detect nAbs, as they
overcome the need for BSL3 facility and have a high-throughput 7. These tests employ
pseudoviruses with SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins for entry possessing a genome inserted with
a reporter gene. The test depends on the expression of the reporter gene in the target cells

which takes 24-48 hours to be detected. In comparison, our hiVNT does not involve gene
expression and thus shortens the TAT to only around 3 hours. Single cell sequencing might
have similar advantages 1 but the need for specialized and expensive equipment hinders its
practical application.
Measurement of antiviral antibodies in the serum of convalescent COVID-19
patients is being studied for its potential to act as a surrogate marker to reflect the presence
of SARS-CoV-2 nAbs 3. Our findings in a small sample size (n=74) reveal that IgG could
serve as a better surrogate marker than IgM (Fig. 3). However, the use of serodiagnostics for
nAb detection could have a few inherent drawbacks. Although all COVID-19 infections elicit
a humoral immune response, the presence of antibodies does not reflect immunity. Also, mild
COVID-19 infections elicit very low humoral response which might not be detected by
serological tests 4. In this setting, surrogate antibody detection tests can produce erroneous
results. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 infects host cells through receptor binding domain (RBD)
within S1 subunit in spike protein on the surface of viral particles that bind to host surface
angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor. ELISA kits to detect anti-RBD antibodies
use in vitro generated spike proteins and its derivatives to detect nAbs in serum. However,
since spike proteins undergo glycosylation and oligomerization in vivo 8,9, the performance
of in vitro generated spike proteins may vary depending on the manufacturing method, as
well as their clinical significance. Also, nAbs that target other regions of spike protein to
suppress the function of fusion peptide of S2 subunit may exist which could go undetected
in S1 and RBD based detection ELISA 10.
In this study, we established the hiVNT; a simple, high-throughput assay system
for the quantitative and rapid determination of SARS-CoV-2 nAbs in the sera of individuals
after recovery from symptomatic or subclinical COVID-19 infection. The hiVNT system
using VLPs, allows for BSL2-compliant testing and gives output in a short time. The
concurrent use of the HiBiT system enhances the assay to give high-throughput quantitative

results. We believe that the hiVNT can be instrumental in identifying individuals with
protective immunity, epidemiological studies on population susceptibility, propagation
modeling, assessing convalescent plasma used for therapy and vaccine evaluation; all these
at a high-throughput and short TAT in a lower biosafety setting.

Materials and Methods
Ethics statement
This study was approved by Yokohama City University Certified Institutional Review Board
(Reference No. B200200048, B160800009), and the protocols used in the study were
approved by the ethics committee. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient
or family/guardian.

Cells and plasmids
HEK293 cells (ATCC #CRL-1573) and VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells (JCRB #1819) were
cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS. VeroE6/TMPRSS2-LgBiT cells were generated by
transfection of pCMV-HaloTag-LgBiT (Promega) with Neon Transfection System (Thermo)
and selected with hygromycin (500 µg/ml). pHIV-GagPol-HiBiT was constructed by the
insertion of HiBiT peptide sequence (VSGWRLFKKIS) into the C-terminal region of capsid
(CA) gene of pHIV-GagPol, encoding codon-optimized HIV-1 Gag and Pol. SARS-CoV-2
Spike gene with replacement of the N-terminal signal peptide (residues 1–14) with CD5
signal sequence was synthesized and inserted into pcDNA6.2-FLAG vector. The spike gene
lacks C-terminal ER retention signal (19 amino acids).

Immunoblotting analysis
Samples in SDS loading buffer were loaded onto 10-20% polyacrylamide gels (Wako),
electrophoresed, and blotted onto PVDF membranes (Merck). Membranes were probed with
anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike S2 (clone 1A9, GeneTex #632604) or anti-HIV p24 (clone 183H12-5C, NIH AIDS Reagent Program #3537) antibodies and horseradish peroxidaseconjugated secondary antibodies (Cytiva). Detected proteins were visualized using
LuminoGraph imaging system (ATTO).

Production of hiVLP-SARS2
hiVLP-SARS2 was produced by transient transfection of HEK293 cells with pHIV-GagPolHiBiT and pSARS2-Spike-FLAG at a ratio of 1:1. Culture supernatants containing VLPs
were collected 48 hours after transfection and filtered through a 0.45 µm Millex-HV filter
(Merck). Virion-incorporated HiBiT and p24 capsid antigens were measured by Nano-Glo
HiBiT Lytic Detection System (Promega) and HIV-1 p24 antigen ELISA (Zepto Metrix),
respectively.

Neutralizing assay using hiVLP-SARS2 (hiVNT)
VeroE6/TMPRSS2-LgBiT cells seeded in 96-well plates were washed and inoculated with
hiVLP-SARS2 stocks (50 µl) containing diluted serum (1:20 for Figs. 2A and 3, 1:20 to
1:12500 dilution for Fig. 2B). In some experiments, anti-spike neutralizing antibody (1:100,
Sino Biological #40592-MM57) or Camostat mesilate (20 µM, Wako #039-17761) was
added to the mixture instead of serum. At 3 hours after inoculation, cells were washed with
PBS and treated with 100 µl of PBS containing DrkBiT peptide (1 µM) for 2 minutes. Cells
were then added with 25 µl of 1x Nano-Glo Live Cell Substrate (Promega). Luciferase
activity is measured with GloMax Discover System (Promega).

Neutralizing assay using authentic SARS-CoV-2
SARS-CoV-2 (JPN/TY/WK-521) was obtained from National Institute of Infectious
Diseases, Japan. For neutralizing assay, VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells seeded in 96-well plates
were washed and infected with 100 µl of medium containing SARS-CoV-2 (moi = 0.05) and
five-fold serially diluted serum (1:100 to 1:62500 dilution). At 48 hours after infection, cells
were washed and added with 40 µl of CellTiter-Glo Substrate (Promega). Cell viability is
measured with GloMax Discover System (Promega).

Neutralizing titer
The neutralizing titer (NT50) was calculated based on the half-maximal inhibitory
concentrations determined by Prism 8.3.1 software (GraphPad).
The neutralization rate (%) was calculated as follows:
RLU (without serum) − RLU (with serum)
× 100
RLU (without serum) − RLU (blank)

ELISA
SARS-CoV-2 NP and SP recombinant protein were coated on 96-well plates (Nunc)
overnight at 4°C. After blocking with 5% BSA in PBS for 1 hour at room temperature, diluted
serum (1:100) were added to each well for 1 hour. Wells were then washed with PBS-T (PBS
with 0.05% Tween-20) and added with HPR-conjugated goat anti-human IgM or IgG
antibody, incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. Wells were washed with PBS-T and
added 1-step TMB substrate (Thermo) and quenched the reaction with 0.5M H2SO4, followed
by absorbance reading at 450 nm.

Statistical analysis
All bar graphs present means and standard deviation. The statistical significance of
differences between two groups was evaluated by two-tailed unpaired t-test in the Prism 8
software (GraphPad).
