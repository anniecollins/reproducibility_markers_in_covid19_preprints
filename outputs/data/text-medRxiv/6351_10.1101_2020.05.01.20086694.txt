ABSTRACT

Background and Aims: No medications are proven to improve clinical outcomes in COVID19. Famotidine is commonly used for gastric acid suppression but has recently gained attention
as an antiviral that may inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication. This study tested whether famotidine
use is associated with improved clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19 initially
hospitalized to a non-intensive care setting.

Methods: This was retrospective cohort study conducted among consecutive hospitalized
patients with COVID-19 infection from February 25 to April 13, 2020 at a single medical center.
The primary exposure was famotidine, received within 24 hours of hospital admission. The
primary outcome was intubation or death. Propensity score matching was used to balance the
baseline characteristics of patients who did and did not use famotidine.

Results: 1,620 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were identified including 84 (5.1%) who
received famotidine within 24 hours of hospital admission. 340 (21%) patients met the study
composite outcome of death or intubation. Use of famotidine was associated with reduced risk
for death or intubation (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 0.42, 95% CI 0.21-0.85) and also with
reduced risk for death alone (aHR 0.30, 95% CI 0.11-0.80). After balancing baseline patient
characteristics using propensity score matching, these relationships were unchanged (HR for
famotidine and death or intubation 0.43, 95% CI 0.21-0.88). Proton pump inhibitors, which also
suppress gastric acid, were not associated with reduced risk for death or intubation.

INTRODUCTION
COVID-19 caused 2 million cases and over 150,000 deaths worldwide as of mid-April 2020 (1).
Clinical trials are underway to assess the efficacy of a variety of antiviral drugs. However, many
of these drugs have toxicities and thus far no drug has been proven to improve outcomes in
COVID-19 patients.

Famotidine is a histamine-2 receptor antagonist that suppresses gastric acid production. In vitro,
famotidine inhibits HIV replication (2). Recently, Wu et al. (3) used computational methods to
predict structures of proteins encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 genome and identified famotidine as
one of the drugs most likely to inhibit the 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) which processes
proteins essential for viral replication (4). We hypothesized that famotidine would be associated
with improved clinical outcomes among hospitalized patients with COVID-19. To explore this,
we performed a retrospective cohort study at a single academic center located at the epicenter of
the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.

METHODS
Population
Adults aged 18 years or more were eligible for the study if they were admitted to Columbia
University Irving Medical Center or its affiliate the Allen Pavilion from February 25, 2020 to
April 13, 2020 and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by nasopharyngeal polymerase chain
reaction at presentation or within no more than 72 hours following admission. This 72-hour
window was selected because, during the earliest phase of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, testing
availability was limited and could take up to 72 hours for a result. Patients were excluded if they

survived less than 48 hours following hospital admission or if they required urgent or semiurgent intubation within 48 hours of hospital admission. This study was approved by the
institutional review board of the Columbia University Irving Medical Center.

Exposure
The primary exposure was use of famotidine, classified as present if famotidine was received
within 24 hours of hospital admission and otherwise classified as absent. Famotidine use was
ascertained directly from electronic medical order entry records and could be intravenous or oral,
at any dose or duration. Home use of famotidine was examined to understand the reason
underlying in-hospital use of famotidine and was classified based on electronic medication
reconciliation performed at the time of hospital admission.

Primary outcome
The primary outcome was a composite of death or endotracheal intubation within 30 days of
hospital admission (intubation-free survival). Mortality data was ascertained from the electronic
medical record (EMR), which interfaces with the social security death index. Endotracheal
intubation was ascertained from EMR documentation of need for mechanical ventilation. The
rationale for the combined primary outcome was twofold: 1) many patients who deteriorated
clinically died without being intubated, often due to transition to palliative care; 2)
hospitalization stays for intubated COVID-19 patients have been very long, and many intubated
COVID-19 patients at the time of the analyses may ultimately not survive.

Co-variables

Based on emerging reports of risk factors for COVID-19, the following co-variables were
selected for inclusion in the analysis: pre-existing diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease
(CAD), heart failure, end-stage renal disease or chronic kidney disease, and chronic pulmonary
disorders, all classified based on the presence of corresponding ICD-10 codes at the time of
hospital admission; obesity, classified based on body mass index (BMI); and age, classified as
<50 years old, 50-65 years old, and >65 years old. To assess severity of COVID-19, the first
recorded form of supplemental oxygen after triage was captured and was classified as room air,
nasal cannula oxygen, or non-rebreather/similar. Use of proton pump inhibitors was classified in
the same manner as use of famotidine so that proton pump inhibitors could be evaluated to test
whether any effects of famotidine might be related to acid suppression. The maximum value of
plasma ferritin was obtained during the study period for each patient to use as a surrogate for the
extent of cytokine storm (normal laboratory range 13.0 to 150.0 ng/mL).

Statistical approach
Categorical variables were compared across exposure groups using chi-squared tests. Full and
reduced Cox proportional hazards models were constructed within the complete cohort, with
patients followed from the time of hospital admission until the first of the following events:
death, intubation, 30 days of follow-up, or the close of the study on April 20, 2020. Because
patients were excluded if they died or were intubated prior to hospital day 2, this effectively
meant that patients were followed from day 2 to day 30. This design was selected to avoid
immortal time bias (i.e., because the exposure was classified based on the 24 hour period after
hospitalization and the at-risk period did not begin until hospital day 2). Cox proportional

hazards modeling was performed on the full cohort, and a matched subset was examined with
propensity scoring matching to balance baseline characteristics based on use of famotidine.
This provided the opportunity for a minimum of 7 days of follow-up time for all patients in the
study. The proportional hazards assumption was verified by visual inspection of time-to-event
data and by testing for a non-zero slope in the Schoenfeld residuals (5). The full Cox model
included all baseline variables. For the reduced model, variables were dropped stepwise unless
they had a significant independent relationship with the composite outcome or unless they
altered the β-coefficient representing famotidine by at least 10%. Propensity score matching
was then performed to balance the baseline characteristics of patients with respect to use of
famotidine with a 5:1 nearest-neighbor matching strategy and a caliper of 0.2. The primary
analysis was conducted as a time-to-event model within the propensity score-matched cohort,
using the same approach. All analyses were performed using STATA statistical software
(version 14, StataCorp) at the α = .05 level of significance.

Additional analyses
Several sensitivity analyses were performed. First, use of proton pump inhibitors was compared
to no proton pump inhibitors within the complete (unmatched) cohort after excluding those who
used famotidine. The purpose of this analysis was to test whether unmeasured patient
characteristics related to use of acid suppression rather than famotidine were associated with
improved outcomes in COVID-19. Second, an additional study cohort was built including
records from patients who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 during the study period. Within this
cohort, use of famotidine was compared to no famotidine to test whether unmeasured patient
characteristics related to use of famotidine were associated with improved outcomes regardless

of reason for hospitalization (i.e., to test whether the observed association with famotidine was
specific for COVID-19 patients).

RESULTS
Population and use of famotidine
1,620 patients met criteria for analysis including 84 patients (5.1%) who received famotidine
within 24 hours of hospital admission. Home use of famotidine was documented on admission
medication reconciliation in 15% of those who used famotidine while hospitalized compared to
1% of those who did not (p<0.01). 28% of all famotidine doses were intravenous; 47% were 20
mg, 35% were 40 mg, and 17% were 10 mg. Famotidine users received a median 5.8 days of
drug for a total median dose of 136 mg (63 – 233 mg). There were minimal differences
comparing patients who used famotidine to those who did not, and balance between the groups
was further improved after propensity score matching (Table 1).

Death or intubation
142 (8.8%) patients were intubated and 238 (15%) died; 340 (21%) patients met the composite
study outcome. In crude analysis, use of famotidine was significantly associated with reduced
risk for the composite outcome of death or intubation (Figure 1A, log-rank p<0.01). This
association was driven primarily by the relationship between famotidine and death (Figure 1B,
log-rank p<0.01) and when those who died prior to intubation were excluded, there was no
association between use of famotidine and intubation (log-rank p=0.40). After adjusting for
baseline patient characteristics, use of famotidine remained independently associated with risk
for death or intubation (Table 2, adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 0.42, 95% CI 0.21-0.85) and this

remained unchanged after propensity score matching to further balance the co-variables (HR
0.43, 95% CI 0.21-0.88).

Additional analyses
Use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) was analyzed because PPIs are also gastric acid
suppression medications with similar indications as famotidine. There was a no protective effect
associated with use of PPIs (aHR 1.34, 95% CI 1.06-1.69). Next, 784 patients without COVID19 who were hospitalized during the same study period were analyzed; among these patients,
famotidine was not associated with reduced risk for death or intubation (24 deaths or intubations,
log-rank p=0.70). The maximum plasma ferritin value during the hospitalization was assessed to
address the hypothesis that, by blocking viral replication, famotidine reduces cytokine storm
during COVID-19. Median ferritin was 708 ng/mL (IQR 370-1,152) among users of famotidine
versus 846 ng/mL (IQR 406-1,552) among non-users (rank-sum p=0.03).

CONCLUSIONS
This retrospective study found that, in patients hospitalized with COVID-19, famotidine use was
associated with a reduced risk of clinical deterioration leading to intubation or death. The study
was premised on the assumption that use of famotidine represented a continuation of home use,
but documentation of why famotidine was given was poor. The results were specific for
famotidine (no protective association was seen for PPIs) and also specific for COVID-19 (no
protective association in patients without COVID-19). A lower peak ferritin value was observed
among users of famotidine, supporting the hypothesis that use of famotidine may decrease
cytokine release in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 infection. A randomized controlled trial is

currently underway to determine whether famotidine can improve clinical outcomes in
hospitalized COVID-19 patients (NCT04370262).

Famotidine has not previously been studied in patients for antiviral effects, and there is limited
relevant prior data. An untargeted computer modeling analysis identified famotidine as one of
the highest-ranked matches for drugs predicted to bind 3CLpro (3), a SARS-CoV-2 protease
which generates non-structure proteins critical to viral replication (4). In the 1990s, histamine-2
receptor antagonists including famotidine were shown to inhibit HIV replication without
affecting lymphocyte viability in vitro (2, 6, 7).

There are limitations to the study. It was observational, and we cannot exclude the possibility of
unmeasured confounders or hidden bias that account for the association between famotidine use
and improved outcomes. No samples were gathered, and mechanism cannot be directly assessed.
Finally, this was a single center study, which may limit generalizability of the findings.

In sum, in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and not initially intubated, famotidine use was
associated with a two-fold reduction in clinical deterioration leading to intubation or death.
These findings are observational and should not be interpreted to mean that famotidine has a
protective effect against COVID-19. Randomized controlled trials are underway.
