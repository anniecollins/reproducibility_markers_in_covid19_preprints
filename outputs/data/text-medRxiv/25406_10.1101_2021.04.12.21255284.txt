Abstract:

41

Background: We assessed the performance of CoronaCHEK lateral flow assay on samples from

42

Uganda and Baltimore to determine the impact of geographic origin on assay performance.

43

Methods: Serum samples from SARS-CoV-2 PCR+ individuals (Uganda: 78 samples from 78

44

individuals and Baltimore: 266 samples from 38 individuals) and from pre-pandemic individuals

45

(Uganda 1077 and Baltimore 532) were evaluated. Prevalence ratios (PR) were calculated to

46

identify factors associated with a false-positive test.

47

Results: After first positive PCR in Ugandan samples the sensitivity was: 45% (95% CI 24,68) at

48

0-7 days; 79% (95%CI 64,91) 8-14 days; and 76% (95%CI 50,93) >15 days. In samples from

49

Baltimore, sensitivity was: 39% (95% CI 30, 49) 0-7 days; 86% (95% CI 79,92) 8-14 days; and

50

100% (95% CI 89,100) 15 days post positive PCR. The specificity of 96.5% (95% CI 97.5,95.2) in

51

Ugandan samples was significantly lower than samples from Baltimore 99.3% (95% CI

52

98.1,99.8), p<0.01. In Ugandan samples, individuals with a false positive result were more likely

53

to be male (PR 2.04, 95% CI 1.03,3.69) or individuals who had a fever more than a month prior

54

to sample acquisition (PR 2.87, 95% CI 1.12,7.35).

55

Conclusions: Sensitivity of the CoronaCHEK was similar in samples from Uganda and Baltimore.

56

The specificity was significantly lower in Ugandan samples than in Baltimore samples. False

57

positive results in Ugandan samples appear to correlate with a recent history of a febrile illness,

58

potentially indicative of a cross-reactive immune response in individuals from East Africa.

INTRODUCTION
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection causes

61

coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (1), which has been detected on all continents and

62

continues to be a public health emergency globally (2). Critical to public health efforts to

63

combat the pandemic are accurate serologic assays to differentiate exposed from unexposed

64

individuals (3). Many studies investigate the performance of these assays on samples from Asia

65

(4), Western Europe (5), and the United States (6). However, little information is available on

66

the performance of these assays in an African setting, though initial studies provide evidence of

67

potential problems (7), particularly among febrile patients infected by other infectious

68

pathogens (8).

69

Serologic assays used for the detection of antibodies to different viral infections can

70

vary in performance based on the origin of the samples being tested, as has been seen in HIV

71

(9), HCV (10), and HSV-2 (11). It is thought that these differences in specificity result from host

72

genetics of the source population and the frequency and distribution of the infectious agents

73

exposed to the population (12). We sought to compare the performance of the CoronaCHEK

74

Lateral Flow Assay (LFA) on samples from Uganda and the United States to assess the impact of

75

geographic origin on the performance of this assay. Samples from known SARS-CoV-2 infected

76

individuals with known duration of infection and pre-pandemic samples were tested to

77

evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the assay and to identify factors associated with a

78

false positive result.

Ethics statement:
The use of samples from Baltimore was approved by The Johns Hopkins University

83

School of Medicine Institutional Review Board (IRB00247886, IRB00250798, and IRB00091667).

84

The use of samples from Uganda was approved by the Uganda Virus Research Institute’s

85

Research Ethics Committee (GC/127/20/04/773, GC/127/13/01/16), Western Institutional

86

Review Board, protocol 200313317 and the Uganda National Council for Science and

87

Technology (HS637ES). The parent studies were conducted according to the ethical standards of

88

the Helsinki Declaration of the World Medical Association, where all subjects provided written

89

informed consent. All samples were de-identified prior to testing.

90
91

Sample sets:

92

To assess sensitivity, samples from subjects known to be SARS-CoV-2 PCR+ from Uganda

93

and the United States with known duration from first PCR+ date were evaluated. Samples from

94

78 PCR+ individuals at different time intervals were identified at the Uganda Virus Research

95

Institute in Entebbe, and Makerere University in Kampala, Uganda. None of the Ugandan

96

individuals were hospitalized and all had mild disease. Samples (n=266) from the United States

97

were from 38 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, attending the Johns Hopkins Hospital in

98

Baltimore, Maryland in the United States (13).

99

To assess the specificity of the assay, pre-pandemic samples were tested. This included

100

1077 stored samples from the Rakai Community Cohort Study, collected between 2011 and

101

2013 (14). The Ugandan samples included 543 individuals who reported having been febrile

102

within the month prior to sample acquisition and 534 individuals who did not report a febrile

illness, matched by age and gender. The 532 pre-pandemic samples from the US were remnant

104

CBC samples collected from Johns Hopkins Hospital Emergency Department (JHH ED) patients

105

collected between December 2015 and January 2016 (15).

106
107
108

Laboratory Testing and Statistical Analysis:
All samples were analyzed with the CoronaCHEK LFA (Hangzhou Biotest Biotech Co Ltd)

109

according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Sensitivity by duration of infection and specificity

110

among pre-pandemic samples were assessed for the presence of either IgM or IgG bands for

111

any reactivity. Statistical analysis was performed with STATA 14.2 (Statacorp College Station,

112

Texas, USA), and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for sensitivity and specificity were

113

calculated with the Clopper-Pearson exact method. Bivariate Poisson regression models were

114

used to calculate prevalence ratios (PR) for factors associated with a false-positive test among

115

pre-pandemic samples.

116
117
118

RESULTS
There were significant differences in the performance for the CoronaCHEK LFA between

119

samples from Uganda and Baltimore (Table 1). When comparing any reactivity (IgM or IgG)

120

there was no significant difference in reactivity by duration of infection. Though 100% of

121

samples from Baltimore were seropositive by 14 days after their first time point, this was not

122

the case for the Ugandan samples. Specificity, when considering any reactive band as a false

123

positive result, was significantly lower in Ugandan samples at 96.9% (CI 95.2, 97.5) than in those

124

from Baltimore, 99.3% (CI 98.1, 99.8), p<0.01. When limited to Ugandan samples collected

125

from individuals with no reported febrile illness in the month prior to sample collection

126

(n=500), the specificity was still significantly lower 96.8% (CI 95.0,98.1) than in those samples

127

from Baltimore, p<0.05.

128

There were four and 38 false positive results in Baltimore pre-pandemic samples and

129

Ugandan samples, respectively. All four from Baltimore were all faint IgM bands while 82%

130

(31/38) of the false positive samples from Uganda had only reactive IgM bands. Of the seven

131

pre-pandemic Ugandan samples that were IgG reactive, two were also reactive for IgM.

132

Ugandan samples were significantly more likely to misclassify if they came from men (PR 2.04,

133

95% CI 1.03, 3.69, p=0.04) or the individual had reported fever more than a month prior to

134

sample collection (PR 2.87, 95% CI 1.12, 7.35, p=0.028). There was a trend to test positive if

135

they had reported pneumonia-like symptoms (PR 2.34, 95% CI 0.98, 5.59, p=0.056). Other

136

factors not associated with a false positive result included age, community type, and HIV status

137

(Table 2). There were too few misclassified samples from Baltimore to assess factors

138

associated with misclassification within this population.

139
140
141

DISCUSSION
This study demonstrates differential performance of the CoronaCHEK LFA on samples

142

collected from Uganda compared to those collected from Baltimore. Though sensitivity for both

143

IgG and IgM in samples from Baltimore was 100% by 14 days after the subjects first PCR+ date,

144

unlike samples from Uganda, this difference was not significantly different. Specificity was

145

significantly lower in the Ugandan pre-pandemic samples compared to those from Baltimore,

146

though this difference was all associated with the IgM band. False positive results in Ugandan

147

samples were higher among men and those who had reported a febrile episode more than a

148

month prior to sample acquisition. Of the false positive results detected, the vast majority

149

were IgM reactivity.

150

These results demonstrate that the performance characteristics of serological assays for

151

SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection cannot be extrapolated to different populations without

152

adequate validation studies. This study supports the need for validation studies on SARS-CoV-2

153

serologic assays in Africa, an area where little data exists (16). Though a lower specificity was

154

found in Ugandan samples than those from Baltimore, the specificity of 96.5% was much

155

greater than the 85% found for the Euroimmun IgG S1 ELISA in pre-pandemic samples from

156

Benin (8). As shown in the study by Mboumba Bouassa (7), our study demonstrated that the

157

main cause for false positive results was a reactive IgM test. If one ignores the presence of an

158

IgM band, the specificity of the CoronaCHEK increased to 99.4% (95% CI 98.7, 99.7) for Ugandan

159

samples and 100% (95% CI 99.3, 100) in Baltimore samples, with no loss of sensitivity at 14 days

160

post first positive PCR for SARS-CoV-2.

161

There are a number of limitations of our study. First, the samples from Uganda of SARS-

162

CoV-2 infected patients were limited, with only six samples within the first week post first PCR

163

positive test and no serial samples for a given individual. Additionally, these samples from

164

known infected Ugandan individuals had limited symptoms, while the Baltimore samples from

165

known SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals were all hospitalized subjects. The pre-pandemic

166

samples from Baltimore were not matched to those from Uganda based on symptomology,

167

though historically, individuals attending the ED in the United States have a high prevalence of

168

fever and viral infections (17). Samples from the JHH ED do have a high burden of chronic viral

169

infections, as demonstrated by a seroprevalence of 6%, 12% and 50% for HIV, HCV and HSV-2

170

respectively (18).

171

In summary, the geographical origin of the samples appeared to impact the

172

performance of the CoronaCHEK LFA. IgM reactivity was the main cause for the false positive

173

results. Given that IgM responses generally appear a couple days before IgG, it may be useful

174

not to measure IgM at all in serological studies given the improvement in specificity. Further

175

evaluations of serologic assays are needed to find appropriate tools for sero-surveillance in an

176

African setting.
