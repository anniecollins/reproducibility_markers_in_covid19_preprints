Abstract

Background: COVID-19 is an ongoing, global public health crisis for which safe and effective
treatments need to be identified. The benefit-risk balance for use of lopinavir-ritonavir in
COVID-19 needs to be monitored on an ongoing basis, therefore a systematic benefit-risk
assessment was designed and conducted. A key objective of this study was to provide a
platform for a dynamic systematic benefit-risk evaluation; although initially this evaluation is
likely to contain limited information, it is required due to the urgent unmet public need.
Importantly it allows additional data to be incorporated as it becomes available, and reevaluation of the benefit-risk profile.
Methods: A systematic benefit-risk assessment was conducted using the Benefit-Risk Action
team (BRAT) framework. The exposure of interest was lopinavir-ritonavir treatment in COVID19 compared to standard of care, placebo or other treatments. A literature search was
conducted in PubMed and EmBase to identify peer-reviewed papers reporting clinical
outcomes. Two clinicians constructed a value tree and ranked key benefits and risks in order
of considered clinical importance.
Results: In comparison to standard of care, data for several key benefits and risks were
identified for lopinavir-ritonavir. Time to clinical improvement was not significantly different
for lopinavir-ritonavir in comparison to standard of care (HR=1.31, 95% CI:0.95, 1.80). There
appeared to be fewer serious adverse events with lopinavir-ritonavir (20%) vs standard of
care (32%). In particular, there were fewer cases of acute respiratory distress syndrome with
lopinavir-ritonavir compared to standard of care (13% vs 27%). Limited data were available
for comparison of lopinavir-ritonavir to other treatments.
Conclusions: Based on currently available data, there was no clear benefit for use of
lopinavir-ritonavir compared to standard of care in severe COVID-19. Risk data suggested a
possible decrease in serious adverse events, including acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Overall, the benefit-risk profile for lopinavir-ritonavir in severe COVID-19 cannot be considered
positive until further efficacy and effectiveness data become available.

1 Introduction
Coronaviruses have circulated in human and animal populations for many years and in humans
they are a cause of respiratory tract infections [1]. More recently, Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019 [2, 3].
SARS-CoV-2 causes coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and this outbreak was declared a global
pandemic by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in March 2020 [4]. Fever, cough and
shortness of breath are the main reported symptoms of COVID-19 [5] but this disease also
has a concerning case mortality rate among certain populations, such as older adults and
those with underlying health conditions.
In the current COVID-19 pandemic, there is a need to identify effective, safe treatments as
rapidly as possible. Lopinavir-ritonavir (LPVr) is a combination protease inhibitor and
nucleoside analogue, used for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) [6].
The use of LPVr in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has been examined previously
and indicated a favourable clinical response [7]. For this reason, multiple trials in COVID-19
are currently being conducted to determine if LPVr is an effective treatment, including the
world-wide RECOVERY trial and the WHO’s SOLIDARITY trial [8-10]. It is essential to examine
the benefit-risk profile of all medications, but ongoing monitoring is especially important where
treatments may be used with limited evidence in new indications. Lopinavir-ritonavir is already
being used as a standard treatment for COVID-19 in some countries, although a systematic
benefit-risk assessment on the use of LPVr for COVID-19 treatment, based on currently
available evidence, has not yet been conducted.
The Benefit-Risk Action Team (BRAT) uses a structured, descriptive framework to outline the
key benefits and risks of a medication within a defined disease context. If sufficient relevant
data are available, additional quantitative assessment can be used to further examine the
benefit-risk profile [11]. BRAT was also designed to assist communication with regulatory
authorities [12]. The framework design allows for transparency in the decision making process
and assumptions can be explored further by sensitivity analyses using quantitative
methods[13].
The systematic benefit-risk assessment for LPVr was conducted based on publicly available
data to May 13th 2020. Due to continuous emerging data on the use of LPVr in COVID-19, the
framework can be subsequently used to repeat the assessment as further data arise, allowing
for rapid and dynamic evidence-based decision-making as more relevant data become
available.

2 Objectives
To examine the benefit-risk profile of lopinavir-ritonavir in COVID-19 patients compared to
standard of care, placebo or other treatments. A key objective of this study was to provide a
platform for a dynamic systematic benefit-risk evaluation; although initially this evaluation is
likely to contain limited information, it is required due to the urgent unmet public need.
Importantly it allows additional data to be incorporated as it becomes available, and reevaluation of the benefit-risk profile.

3 Methods
3.1

Benefit-Risk Framework

3.1.1 Population of interest
Patients with COVID-19 who were treated with LPVr were the population of interest, while
patients receiving standard of care, placebo or other treatments were the comparator of
interest.

3.1.2 Outcomes of interest
Key benefits and risks, i.e. those considered to be of clinical importance or potentially serious,
were included in the value tree which provides a visual representation of these outcomes in
the context of severe COVID-19 disease. These benefits and risks displayed in the value tree
were ranked according to perceived importance (benefits) and potential seriousness (risks).
Risks were categorised according to which system organ class (SOC) they belonged to, and
where multiple events were identified within the same SOC, the ranking was based on the
most serious event(s) within that SOC, with the most serious event(s) in each SOC presented
first.

3.1.3 Data sources and customisation of the framework
A literature search was performed in PubMed and Embase using the following search strategy:
(lopinavir AND ritonavir) AND (covid* OR SARS-CoV-2 OR n?CoV OR coronavirus)
Papers were included if they reported quantitative data on effectiveness and/or safety of LPVr
in patients with severe COVID-19. Case reports and case series were excluded. Results were
restricted to English language only (abstracts in English language were acceptable where

sufficient data provided) and peer-reviewed publications since 2019 to 13th May 2020. Data
were extracted for each benefit and risk, for LPVr and the comparator (standard of care,
placebo or other treatments), where available. EudraVigilance spontaneous reporting data (up
to 8th May 2020) for LPVr where used in COVID-19 were also examined.

3.2

Outcome assessment

Key benefits and risks associated with the use of LPVr were identified from available data
sources, including the product information, regulatory assessment reports, and published
literature. Predicted key benefits (clinical endpoints) were derived from both published
literature and in the case of ongoing studies, available clinical trial protocols. A summary
benefit-risk table was created to allow visualisation of the magnitude of each benefit and risk.
Risk differences and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for each
outcome where both numerator (number of events) and denominator (number of patients at
risk) were available for both the treatment group (LPVr) and comparator group. No
appropriate comparator groups were identified in EudraViligance for LPVr. Consequently,
spontaneous reports are not included in the benefit-risk table and are presented in the text
only.

4 Results
Figure 1 displays the value tree of the key benefits and risks related to LPVr treatment in
COVID-19.

4.1

Benefits

Key benefits have been listed in the value tree in descending order of perceived clinical
importance. At the current time, only one clinical trial was identified which provided empirical
data for any of the clinical endpoints listed in the value tree [14]. Whilst the primary objective
of this clinical trial was time to clinical improvement, additional data was provided for various
endpoints including mortality risk, risk and duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, risk of
non-invasive ventilation and oxygen requirement.

4.2

Risks

Key risks were identified for LPVr based on the current available evidence. It is acknowledged
that this product is not licenced for use in the treatment of COVID-19 disease, and whilst
safety data is available for its licenced use in HIV-1, its safety profile in the context of COVID19 is largely unknown. Furthermore, for the limited safety data that is available for its use in

COVID-19, it is often unclear whether the reported adverse event is due to the use of LPVr,
or attributable to the underlying disease. Potentially serious risks that are likely to still pose a
risk with the proposed short-term use of LPVr for COVID-19 have been summarised in the
value tree and ranked according to perceived seriousness.
One of the most serious risks is prolongation of the QT interval, and the subsequent increased
risk of sudden cardiac death [15-18]. Patients with COVID-19 are already predisposed to the
development of cardiac arrhythmia due to the effect of the virus on metabolic dysfunction,
myocardial inflammation and the sympathetic nervous system [16]. Also it is important to
note that LPVr is an inhibitor of CYP3A4, and therefore it cannot be used with other medicines
which are substrates of this enzyme, such as chloroquine, which itself can cause QT
prolongation [17]. In addition to the effects on QT prolongation, LPVr has also been shown to
cause modest asymptomatic prolongation of the PR interval in some healthy adult subjects,
with rare reports of 2nd or 3rd degree atrioventricular block in patients with underlying
structural heart disease and pre-existing conduction system abnormalities or in patients
receiving drugs known to prolong the PR interval (such as verapamil or atazanavir), and
therefore LPVr should be used with caution [19] in such patients.
Lopinavir/ritonavir are both inhibitors of the P450 isoform CYP3A, and therefore treatment is
likely to increase plasma concentrations of concomitant medicinal products that are primarily
metabolised by CYP3A [19]. Clinically significant drug interactions have been observed with
LPVr use during treatment for COVID-19, including increased plasma levels of direct oral
anticoagulants [20], and increased plasma levels of immunosuppressants in organ transplant
recipients [21].
Certain risks factors and clinical characteristics have been associated with the development of
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) amongst patients with COVID-19 [22]. Patients
who developed COVID-19 related ARDS were likely to require admission to the intensive care
unit (ICU). In the study by Cao et al, respiratory failure/ARDS was reported as a serious
adverse event in both treatment groups [14]. Whilst causality in these cases is not known, it
would seem likely that these cases were attributable to progression of the underlying COVID19 disease.
Hypersensitivity reactions such as urticaria and angioedema are reported to occur commonly
with the use of LPVr for the treatment of HIV, and rarely serious skin reactions such as
Stevens-Johnson syndrome and erythema multiforme have been reported with its use in this
treatment population [19]. Gastrointestinal side effects of LPVr are well recognised, and
diarrhoea and nausea are very common. Serious gastrointestinal adverse effects included in

the key risks for this assessment include pancreatitis, which has been associated with the use
of LPVr [19, 23, 24]; most patients who developed pancreatitis during treatment for HIV had
a prior history of this condition. Treatment with LPVr has been associated with an increase in
triglycerides in patients treated for HIV [19], and amongst patients treated for COVID-19 [2528], which is likely to be another contributory factor in the development of pancreatitis.
In the context of treatment for HIV, LPVr has been uncommonly associated with certain
adverse renal outcomes, including a reduction in creatine clearance, nephritis and haematuria
[19]. Cases of acute kidney injury have been reported in patients taking LPVr in COVID-19,
however it is unclear whether there is any association, as this outcome was reported more
frequently amongst patients in the standard of care comparator group [14] in addition to
overall limited safety data availability. Elevations of liver enzymes have also been commonly
reported with the use of LPVr in the treatment of HIV [19], and liver injury has been reported
in patients treated with LPVr for COVID-19 [29, 30].

Blood dyscrasias have also been

associated with the use of LPVr during HIV treatment [19], with reports of severe anaemia
amongst patients treated for COVID-19 [14].

4.3

Quantitative data

Data for outcomes are presented in the data extraction table and key benefit-risk summary
table (Tables 1 and 2, respectively). From literature searching we identified 143 papers from
PubMed and 264 papers from Embase for LPVr. After initial review and removal of duplicates,
15 papers were reviewed further to determine whether they met all inclusion criteria; seven
papers were included in the final benefit-risk assessment.
In comparison to standard of care, data for several key benefits and risks for LPVr were
identified. In the Cao et al trial [14], the benefit of time to clinical improvement (intention to
treat analysis) was not statistically significant after adjustment for other covariates in
comparison to standard of care (16 vs 16 days, HR=1.31, 95% CI: 0.95, 1.80). Other nonsignificant benefit data were identified in this trial including median duration of mechanical
ventilation (RD=-1 days, 95% CI: -4, 2) and death at 28 days (RD=-0.06, 95% CI: -0.17,
0.06).
Risk data were mainly available from the Cao et al trial, which reported fewer serious adverse
events in patients taking LPVr (20%) compared to standard of care (32%). There were fewer
cases of ARDS with LPVr compared to standard of care (13% vs 27%).
Limited data were available for comparison of LPVr to other treatments. Viral clearance at day
14 for LPVr was lower compared to arbidol (85% vs 91%), and there was minimal difference

in mean time to viral clearance (10.20 days vs 10.11 days, respectively). Data were only
available for one risk in comparison to arbidol; a lower proportion of those patients treated
with LPVr experienced increased ALT compared to arbidol (9% vs 19%, respectively).
In spontaneous reports from Eudravigilance, for LPVr used in COVID-19, there were 28 reports
of hepatocellular injury, 15 reports of acute kidney injury, 17 reports of prolongation of the
QT interval, six reports of ARDS and three reports of pancreatitis. Information on case reports
was only available from the publicly available dataset and so was limited.

5 Discussion
This paper provides a systematic benefit-risk assessment using the BRAT methodology and is
inclusive of available literature up to and including 13th May 2020. Therefore, this represents
a snapshot of the data available to date and outlines a clear and transparent framework into
which subsequent clinical trial and observational study data can be incorporated, and the
benefit-risk profile re-assessed.
At the current time, data relating to the benefits of LPVr are limited, with efficacy data available
from only one published clinical trial. This trial found no statistically significant difference in
the primary outcome of time to improvement (intention to treat analysis) between the two
groups (LPVr treatment in addition to standard supportive care vs. standard care alone),
however the sample size was small. There was some evidence (though not statistically
significant) that LPVr reduced mortality at 28 days [95% CI: 19.2% vs. 25.0%, difference of
-5.8% (95% CI: -17.3% to 5.70%)]. It is of note that the median time interval between
symptom onset and randomization was 13 days (IQR, 11 to 16 days), therefore it is unknown
whether more favourable results may have been seen if drug treatment had been initiated
earlier in the course of the disease.
The safety profile of LPVr in the treatment of severe COVID-19 disease is largely unknown.
We identified key risks from its usage in the treatment of HIV, in addition to the limited safety
data available from its use in COVID-19. Comparator safety data revealed a lower incidence
of both ARDS and all serious adverse events amongst patients receiving LPVr compared to
standard of care ([risk difference -147 events per 1000 patients], [-123 events per 1000
patients], respectively). Very small numbers of cases of other adverse events were reported
in the study by Cao et al., including severe anaemia, acute gastritis and lower gastrointestinal
bleeding, all of which were only reported amongst patients taking LPVr. The incidence of acute
kidney injury was lower in the Cao et al trial amongst patients taking LPVr compared to
standard of care (3% vs 6%).

Overall, there was a lack of efficacy data with no clear benefits identified for LPVr treatment
compared to standard of care. Risk data, although limited, suggested a possible decrease in
adverse events for some serious outcomes compared to standard of care. Further data is
needed on efficacy and effectiveness of LPVr for severe COVID-19.

5.1

Strengths and Limitations

A strength of this approach is the inclusion of all key benefits and risks in the same model and
a transparent framework into which further data can be included as and when this becomes
available. The method has a significant advantage compared to systematic reviews which are
equally comprehensive but focus only on efficacy. When sufficient data is available, the
methodology allows benefits and risks to be ranked, and weightings applied based on this
ranking, with further quantitative analysis. The reproducibility of this assessment allows
multiple treatments to be assessed using this approach, thereby allowing direct comparison
between different treatments. This is of great significance during the current COVID-19 crisis,
in which several potential interventions currently under evaluation need to be assessed and
evaluated in real time, and where new data needs to be incorporated quickly. Regulatory
decision makers are also familiar with this framework, facilitating interpretation.
A limitation of the benefit-risk assessment presented at this time is the relative paucity of data
that has been included in the model, as many clinical trials assessing LPVr are still ongoing.
In addition, trials for which data were available had very small sample sizes and were likely
to be underpowered when examining non-primary outcomes. Study quality was also not
considered in the assessment, although we only included peer-reviewed manuscripts.

5.2

Conclusions

Based on currently available data, there was no clear benefit for use of LPVr
compared to standard of care in severe COVID-19. Risk data suggested a possible decrease
in serious adverse events, including ARDS. Overall, the benefit-risk profile for LPVr in severe
COVID-19 cannot be considered positive until further efficacy and effectiveness data become
available.

Drug Interactions

1Both

Lopinavir/ritonavir acts as a CYP3A4 inhibitor resulting in clinically significant drug interactions

benefits and risks have been ranked according to perceived clinical significance. Risks have been categorised according to system organ class (SOC). The SOCs have been ranked based on the most serious events/events within each system, which have
been presented first; ECMO=Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation; ICU=Intensive Care Unit; ARDS=Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome; AST=Aspartate aminotransferase; ALT=Alanine aminotransferase; GGT=Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase
