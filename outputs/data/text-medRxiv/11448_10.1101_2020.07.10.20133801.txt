KEY-POINTS
Question: Do pregnant women with symptomatic COVID-19 infection exhibit signs shared

with preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome? Are these conditions ruled out by the measurement
of angiogenic factors?

Findings: In series of 27 pregnancies with symptomatic COVID-19 infection, 7 presented at

least one sign of suspected HELLP syndrome. In 6 of them, the level of angiogenic factors
ruled out preeclampsia.

Meaning: Symptomatic COVID-19 may simulate severe pregnancy in pregnancy. Angiogenic

factors may be essential to avoid false diagnosis and needless interventions.
These data were presented in a Virtual Symposium on Covid-19 and Pregnancy on 17 April:

ABSTRACT
Importance: The clinical presentation of hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet
count (HELLP) syndrome is one of the more severe forms of preeclampsia. COVID-19
infection exhibits signs that are shared with preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome, which may
lead to needless interventions and iatrogenic preterm delivery.
Objective: We evaluated the prevalence of HELLP-like signs in pregnant women admitted for
COVID-19 and the value of angiogenic factors to rule out preeclampsia.

Methods: a consecutive series of 27 pregnant women beyond 20 weeks of gestation, with
symptomatic COVID-19. Clinical and analytical features were recorded and those cases with
signs of HELLP syndrome were tested for sFlt-1/PlGF ratio.
Results: Seven patients (25.9%) presented at least one sign of suspected HELLP syndrome, of
which 2 (7.4%) were diagnosed clinically with PE because of hypertension and high
transaminases and 5 (18.5%) had only elevated transaminases. sFlt-1/PlGF ratio was normal
in 6 of 7.
Conclusion: Symptomatic COVID-19 may simulate severe preeclampsia in pregnancy.
Angiogenic factors may be essential to avoid false diagnosis and needless interventions.

Introduction
The COVID-19 outbreak has now rapidly spread worldwide, being declared by the WHO a
pandemic infection on March 11th, with more than 1.2 million reported infections and 67,000

deaths (April 6th) (1). With more than 130,000 infections and 12,000 deaths, Spain is the

second country in number of cases (1). The features of COVID-19 in pregnancy are still poorly
described.
Symptomatic COVID-19 is characterized by flu-like symptoms, but in around 15% of cases it is
developed a severe respiratory compromise or multi-organ failure (2).

Abnormal

aminotransferase and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels and proteinuria are common
features, not only in critically ill patients but also in milder forms of COVID-19 (3)(4). These
signs could be clinically relevant in pregnant women. In pregnancy, the clinical presentation
of hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count (HELLP) syndrome is one of the
more severe forms of preeclampsia because it has been associated with increased rates of
maternal morbidity and mortality. HELLP syndrome may have an insidious and atypical onset, with
up to 15% of the patients lacking either hypertension (5).

Therefore, COVID-19 signs in pregnant

women might lead to a misdiagnosis of preeclampsia and iatrogenic preterm delivery.
Maternal levels of the angiogenic factors placental growth factor (PlGF), soluble fms-like
tyrosine kinase , and particularly the ratio sFlt-1/PlGF have recently been proposed as highly
specific markers in ruling out suspected preeclampsia (6).
There is no previous information on the frequency of preeclampsia-like signs in COVID-19
pregnant women and whether angiogenic factors might help in the differential diagnosis with
true preeclampsia. In this series we recorded the clinical and analytical data of a consecutive
series of 27 pregnant women with symptomatic COVID-19. We describe the prevalence of
HELLP-like syndrome and the performance of sFlt-1/PlGF ratio to rule out true preeclampsia.

Methods
A case-series was created of consecutive pregnant women of more than 20 weeks of
gestation presenting with symptomatic COVID-19 between March 21st and April 7th 2020, at
two hospitals in Barcelona, with symptomatic and confirmed COVID-19 infection by
quantitative RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs.
This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Hospital Sant Joan de Deu (PIC-56-20).
Symptomatic disease was defined by the presence acute respiratory tract infection (sudden
onset of at least one of the following: cough, fever [central temperature >38ºC], shortness of
breath) with no other etiology that fully explains the clinical presentation
Management of patients followed the WHO guidance (7) .
In women in which there was a clinical suspicion of HELLP syndrome, maternal serum levels
of soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 [sFlt-1] and placental growth factor [PlGF] and sFlt1/PlGF ratio were determined by the fully automated Elecsys assays for sFlt-1 and PlGF on an
electrochemiluminescence immunoassay platform (Cobas analyzers, Roche Diagnostics).
Preeclampsia was defined according to ACOG criteria (5) and abnormal aminotransferase or
lactate dehydrogenase levels were defined when above twice the upper laboratory reference
value.

Results
A total of 27 pregnant women were included. Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of
the population. Overall, 7 patients (25.9%) presented at least one sign of suspected HELLP
syndrome, of which 2 (7.4%) were diagnosed clinically with PE because of hypertension and
proteinuria or elevated transaminases; 3 (11.1%) had significant proteinuria plus elevated
transaminases; and, 2 had isolated abnormal transaminase levels. sFlt-1/PlGF ratio was
elevated over the cut-off for preeclampsia in 1 of 7. Of note, magnesium sulphate was
initiated in 2 patients, and discontinued in those with normal levels. There were no other
obstetrical complications. Table 2 shows the clinical characteristics of these seven
pregnancies.

Discussion
The effect of COVID-19 infection on pregnancy is not well known because of the lack
of reliable data. Small series from China suggest that the clinical characteristics of
COVID-19 in pregnancy do not differ from those reported in non-pregnant adults
(8)(9)(10). In this series, rather than focusing on perinatal outcomes, we report that
26% of pregnant women presented clinical or analytical features currently considered
for the diagnosis of preeclampsia or HELLP syndrome.
As already described in adults (3), we found abnormal aminotransferase or lactate
dehydrogenase levels in one-third of cases. Massive proteinuria has also been
reported in one-third of adults with COVID-19 (4). These signs are shared with
preeclampsia, one of the most feared complications of pregnancy, which complicates
2% to 8% and is a leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality (11) and
iatrogenic prematurity (12). Accordingly, best practice guidelines for severe PE entails
early treatment with magnesium sulphate and elective preterm delivery (5). Thus,
obstetricians should be aware of the risk of misdiagnosing severe preeclampsia in
COVID-19.
Other obstetric and medical disorders share clinical and laboratory findings with
severe preeclampsia (13). Maternal levels of sFlt-1/PlGF, as markers of placental
vasculogenesis, have a high performance in ruling out suspicion of preeclampsia (6).
This preliminary series suggest that the performance of angiogenic factors is high in
women with COVID-19 infection, and thus measuring angiogenic factors seems critical
in COVID-19 pregnancies with PE-like analytical signs to rule out true PE, avoiding
needless interventions and iatrogenic preterm delivery.
