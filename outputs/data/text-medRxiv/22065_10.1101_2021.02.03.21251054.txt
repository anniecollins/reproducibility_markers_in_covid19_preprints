Abstract

46

Two dose mRNA vaccination provides excellent protection against SARS-CoV-2. However,

47

there are few data on vaccine efficacy in elderly individuals above the age of 801.

48

Additionally, new variants of concern (VOC) with reduced sensitivity to neutralising

49

antibodies have raised fears for vulnerable groups. Here we assessed humoral and cellular

50

immune responses following vaccination with mRNA vaccine BNT162b22 in elderly

51

participants prospectively recruited from the community and younger health care workers.

52

Median age was 72 years and 51% were females amongst 140 participants. Neutralising

53

antibody responses after the first vaccine dose diminished with increasing age, with a marked

54

drop in participants over 80 years old. Sera from participants below and above 80 showed

55

significantly lower neutralisation potency against B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1. variants of

56

concern as compared to wild type. Those over 80 were more likely to lack any neutralisation

57

against VOC compared to younger participants following first dose. The adjusted odds ratio

58

for inadequate neutralisation activity against the B.1.1.7, P.1 and B.1.351 variant in the older

59

versus younger age group was 4.3 (95% CI 2.0-9.3, p<0.001), 6.7 (95% CI 1.7- 26.3,

60

p=0.008) and 1.7 (95% CI 0.5-5.7, p=0.41). Binding IgG and IgA antibodies were lower in

61

the elderly, as was the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 Spike specific B-memory cells. We

62

observed a trend towards lower somatic hypermutation in participants with suboptimal

63

neutralisation, and elderly participants demonstrated clear reduction in class switched somatic

64

hypermutation, driven by the IgA1/2 isotype. SARS-CoV-2 Spike specific T- cell IFN𝛾 and

65

IL-2 responses fell with increasing age, and both cytokines were secreted primarily by CD4 T

66

cells. We conclude that the elderly are a high risk population that warrant specific measures

67

in order to mitigate against vaccine failure, particularly where variants of concern are

68

circulating.

Background

71

Vaccines designed to elicit protective immune responses remain the key hope for containing

72

the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In particular, mRNA vaccines have shown excellent efficacy

73

using a two-dose approach, separated by a three or four week gap2,3. Although data on

74

neutralising responses as a correlate of protection are increasing4,5, few data on neutralising

75

responses or vaccine efficacy in elderly individuals above the age of 80 are available in trial

76

settings1. This is even more pertinent for settings where a dosing interval of 12-16 weeks or

77

even more has been implemented to maximise first dose administration6. In the absence of

78

adequate clinical trial data, real world data on vaccine responses are vital in order to

79

understand the likely efficacy of vaccination using this dosing regime in those who are at

80

greatest risk of severe disease and death7.

81
82

Additionally, the emergence of new variants with increased transmissibility8, reduced

83

sensitivity to vaccine elicited antibodies9 and reduced clinical efficacy in preventing

84

infection10 has raised fears for vulnerable groups where magnitude and quality of immune

85

responses may be suboptimal. Here we assessed humoral and cellular immune responses

86

following vaccination with mRNA-based vaccine BNT162b22 in unselected elderly

87

participants from the community and younger health care workers.

Results

90

Neutralisation of SARS-CoV-2 following mRNA vaccination in the elderly

91

One hundred and forty participants received at least one vaccination, with median age 72

92

years (IQR 44-83) and 51% of participants female (Extended Data Figure 1). We first

93

validated the use of a pseudotyped virus (PV) system to investigate neutralisation, by

94

comparing geometric mean titres (GMT) between PV expressing Wuhan-1 D614G spike and

95

a B.1 lineage live virus isolate, using sera isolated from thirteen individuals after two vaccine

96

doses (Extended data Figure 2a). We observed high correlation between the two approaches,

97

consistent with previous literature11, and therefore proceeded with the PV system.

98
99

We explored the association between age and ability to neutralise virus by plotting the

100

proportion of individuals who had detectable virus neutralisation after the first dose at a given

101

age. This analysis showed a non-linear relationship with marked drop around the age of 80

102

(Figure 1a). Given this observation of a non-linear change in a correlate of protection we

103

performed selected subsequent analyses with age both as a continuous variable and as a

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.03.21251054; this version posted June 25, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

104

categorical variable. When individuals 80 years and above were tested between 3 and 12

105

weeks post first dose, around half had no evidence of neutralisation (Extended data Figure

106

2b). GMT was lower in participants 80 years and older than in younger individuals [48.2

107

(95% CI 34.6-67.1) vs 104.1 (95% CI 69.7-155.2) p<0.0001 Table 1, Figure 1b]. Geometric

108

mean neutralisation titre (GMT) after the first dose (but not second dose) showed evidence of

109

a modest inverse association with age (Extended data Figure 2c). The duration of the interval

110

between first and second dose (three versus twelve weeks) did not appear to impact GMT

111

following the second dose, though numbers were limited (Extended data Figure 2d). There

112

was evidence for prior COVID-19 infection in 5 individuals in each group using a clinically

113

accredited assay for N antibodies9 (Table 1), and this was adjusted for in multivariable

114

analyses (Table 2, Supplementary Table 1). Sera from vaccinated individuals exhibited an

115

increase in neutralising titres between the first and second doses for individuals both below

116

and above the age of 80 years (Figure 1b). In those participants with suboptimal or no

117

neutralisation who received second doses within the study period (examples shown in Figure

118

1c), testing after the second dose showed that all responded (Table 1 and Figure 1b).

119
120

Neutralisation of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern by vaccine elicited sera in the elderly

121

Given our observation that the participants 80 years old and older had lower neutralisation

122

responses following first dose, we hypothesised that this could lead to sub protective

123

neutralising responses against B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1 variants of concern (VOC),

124

originating in UK, South Africa and Brazil respectively (Figure 1d). We therefore examined

125

serum neutralisation by age group against PV bearing WT or the three VOC spike proteins

126

(Figure 1e, f). There was a clear reduction in neutralising titres against VOC as previously

127

noted (Figure 1e), with the over 80 year olds exhibiting lower titres than younger individuals

128

for all except B.1.351 where neutralisation was very poor universally following the first dose.

129

When we analysed the proportions of individuals with no detectable neutralisation we

130

observed the same pattern (Figure 1f). The adjusted odds ratio for achieving inadequate

131

neutralisation against WT was 3.7 (95% CI 1.7-8.1, p 0.001) for participants 80 years and

132

older versus those younger than 80 years (Table 2). The adjusted odds ratio for inadequate

133

neutralisation activity against the B.1.1.7, P.1 and B.1.351 variant in the older versus younger

134

age group was 4.3 (95% CI 2.0-9.3, p<0.001), 6.7 (95% CI 1.7- 26.3, p=0.008) and 1.7 (95%

135

CI 0.5-5.7, p=0.41) respectively (Table 2 and Supplementary Table 1).

Binding Antibody responses and B cell Repertoire Analyses

138

Binding antibody responses to full length WT Wuhan-1 Spike were comprehensively

139

measured using a clinically accredited particle based assay that we have previously

140

described9. IgG and all IgG subclasses against Spike increased between vaccine doses (Figure

141

2a), reaching levels after the second dose similar to those observed following natural

142

infection. IgG against Spike declined with age mirroring the neutralisation titres (Figure 2b,

143

Extended Data Figure 3a). The concentration of total and subclass anti-Spike IgGs were

144

significantly lower in the 80 years and older age group (Figure 2c). IgG and subclasses

145

showed correlation with neutralisation (Figure 2c and Extended Data Figure 3b). IgA

146

responses were detected both in convalescent sera (from individuals hospitalised in early-mid

147

2020) and after both doses, with an increase between the two time points (Extended Data

148

Figure 3c). Spike specific IgA also correlated with neutralisation after dose 1(Extended Data

149

Figure 3d). In addition, PBMC phenotyping by flow cytometry revealed neutralisation in the

150

over 80 age group was associated with higher proportion of spike specific IgG+ IgM- CD19+

151

B memory cells (Figure 3e). Interestingly this did not differentiate neutralisers from non-

152

neutralisers in the under 80 group (Figure 3e, Extended Data Figure 4b).

153
154

Next B cell Repertoire (BCR) sequencing on bulk PBMCs was performed to assess isotype

155

and variable gene usage, somatic hypermutation and diversity of the repertoire between the

156

two age groups and in relation to neutralisation. All patients analysed had been vaccinated at

157

a minimum 17 days prior. After correcting for multiple comparisons, there were no

158

differences in isotype proportions between the two age groups (Extended Data Figure 5), or

159

by neutralisation (Figure 3a). We next looked for skewing in V gene use (Figure 3b). We

160

found an increase in usage of the IGHV4 family in the older age group with an increased

161

proportion of IGHV4.34, IGHV4.39, IGHV4.59 and IGHV4.61 whilst in the younger age

162

group there was an increase in usage of the IGHV1 family with increases in IGHV1.18 and

163

IGHV1.69D. We did not find any significant differences in V gene usage with neutralisation

164

(Extended Data Figure 5).

165
166

Differences in somatic hypermutation could impact neutralisation through antibody affinity

167

maturation. We found that participants 80 years or older had a lower level of somatic

168

hypermutation compared with the under 80 year olds in class-switched BCRs, which was

169

driven by the IgA1/2 isotype (Figure 3c). There appeared to be a correlation between IC50

170

and degree of somatic hypermutation in class-switched BCRs (Figure 3d) driven

171

predominantly by IGHA (Figure 3e). We did not observe a relationship between titres of IgG

172

and mutation in BCRs for IgG1/2 (Extended Data Figure 5). To assess whether there

173

was greater clonal expansion in those younger than 80 years old that might explain higher

174

neutralising responses, we calculated richness, using the Chaol1 measure and diversity

175

using D50, Simpson's and Shannon-weiner indices. We did not find any significant

176

differences between age groups or a relationship between measures of diversity and

177

neutralisation potency (Figure 3f, Extended Data Figure 5).

178
179

We next examined the BCR for public clones known to be associated with SARS-CoV-2

180

neutralisation. We explored the convergence between BCR clones present in our study with

181

the CoV-AbDab database, a resource detailing all published antibodies shown to bind SARS-

182

CoV-212. Convergent clones were annotated with the same IGHV and IGHJ segments, had

183

the same CDR-H3 region length and were clustered based on 85% CDR-H3 sequence amino

184

acid homology. A cluster was considered convergent with the CoV-AbDab database if it

185

contained sequences from post-vaccinated individuals and from the database. This analysis

186

revealed that participants under 80 had a higher frequency of convergent clones in keeping

187

with increased neutralization when compared with the >80 age group (Figure 3g).

188
189

T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 spike following mRNA vaccination

190

Whilst neutralising antibodies are increasingly recognised as dominating protection against

191

initial infection4,13, T cells may also play a role where neutralising antibody titres are low14,

192

possibly limiting disease progression5. We therefore determined the T cell response to SARS-

193

CoV-2 spike protein in vaccinees by stimulating PBMC with overlapping peptide pools to the

194

wild type SARS-CoV-2 spike, using IFN and IL-2 FluoroSpot assay to enumerate spike

195

specific T cells. With the same peptide pool, we also stimulated i. PBMC that had been

196

collected and biobanked between 2014-2016 - representing a healthy SARS-CoV-2

197

unexposed population to provide a background control, ii. PBMC from donors who had RT-

198

PCR confirmed infection with SARS-CoV-2 for a comparison of T cell responses following

199

natural infection. When we plotted IFNγ spike specific T cell responses against age as a

200

continuous variable there was a negative correlation and drop off at around 80 years (Figure

201

4a). A similar though less pronounced effect was seen for IL-2 (Figure 4b). However, there

202

did not appear to be a relationship between cytokine production by PBMC and neutralisation

203

titre following first dose (Extended Data Figure 6).

204

205

Following the first dose of vaccine, the frequency of IFNγ secreting T cells against a peptide

206

pool including Cytomegalovirus, EBV and Flu (CEF+) specific peptides did not differ by age

207

category and was similar to healthy SARS-CoV-2 unexposed controls (Figure 4c).

208

This indicates that differences in observed responses were likely vaccine specific and

209

unlikely due to generalised suboptimal T cell responses/immune paresis. However, IFNγ

210

spike specific T cell responses were significantly larger than responses observed in an

211

unexposed population for individuals under 80 (Figure 4d). Importantly however, in the 80

212

years and older participants, the IFNγ spike specific T cell responses were not different from

213

the unexposed controls following first dose (Figure 4d). By contrast, spike specific IL-2 T

214

cell frequencies were significantly greater than unexposed control in both age groups (Figure

215

4e). Interestingly, it appeared that whilst spike specific IFNγ and IL2 responses in PBMC

216

were similar to those found after natural infection (Figure 4f,g), the second dose did not

217

increase these responses, either overall (Figure 4f,g) or within age categories (Figure 4h,i).

218
219

We separated T cell subsets to further clarify the cells producing IFNγ and IL-2. PBMC from

220

a sample of individuals <80 years and >80 years were depleted of CD4 or CD8 T cells and

221

stimulated with spike peptide pool as before. Our results showed that the majority of IFNγ

222

and IL-2 production was from the CD4+ T cells in vaccinated individuals (Figure 4j,k). The

223

over 80 year olds had markedly lower spike specific IL2 CD4 T cell responses than their

224

younger counterparts (Figure 4i).

225
226

CMV serostatus has been associated with poorer responses to vaccination and infections15,16

227

and we hypothesised that older individuals were more likely to be CMV positive and

228

therefore poorer associated T cell responses to mRNA vaccination. We therefore ascertained

229

CMV serostatus by ELISA testing and related this to T cell responses and serum

230

neutralisation. As expected, CMV IgG positivity was higher in the 80 years and older age

231

group (Extended Data Figure 7). Surprisingly however, CMV positive individuals in the 80

232

years and older group had significantly higher IFN but not IL2, responses to SARS-CoV-2

233

spike peptides compared to the under 80 year old group (Extended Data Figure 7).

234
235

Autoantibodies and inflammatory chemo/cytokines and responses to mRNA vaccination

236

Finally, we investigated possible interplay between senescence and mRNA vaccine responses.

237

Autoantibodies and inflammatory cyto/chemokines are associated with immune senescence17.

238

We first measured a panel of autoantibodies in the sera of 101 participants following the first

239

dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine. 8 participants had positive autoantibodies for anti-

240

myeloperoxidase (anti-MPO), 2 for anti-fibrillarin and 1 for anti-cardiolipin antibodies

241

(Extended Data Figure 8). As expected, all but one of the participants with anti-

242

myeloperoxidase autoantibody was over the age of 80 years (Extended Data Figure 8). There

243

was a trend towards reduced anti-Spike IgG levels and serum neutralisation against wild type

244

and B.1.17 Spike mutant in participants with positive autoantibodies, although this did not reach

245

statistical significance, likely due to small numbers (Extended Data Figure 8). Next, we

246

explored the association between serum cytokines/chemokines and neutralisation of SARS-

247

CoV-2 PV as well as their association with age. PIDF, a known SASP (senescence associated

248

secretory phenotype) molecule was the only molecule enriched in sera from participants over

249

80 years, and there was no association between any of these molecules and ability of sera to

250

neutralise SARS-CoV-2 PV (Extended Data Figure 8).

251
252
253

Discussion

254

Immune senescence is a well described phenomenon whereby responses to pathogens 18 and

255

indeed vaccines are impaired/dysregulated with age19. As an example, effective seasonal

256

influenza vaccination of the elderly is a significant public health challenge due to greater

257

morbidity and mortality in this group. Lower neutralizing antibody titres using standard dose

258

influenza vaccines in elderly individuals has been addressed by using higher dose vaccine,

259

highlighting that understanding of age related heterogeneity in vaccine responses can lead to

260

policy change and mitigation 20.

261
262

Neutralising antibodies are likely the strongest correlate of protection from SARS-CoV-2

263

infection, as shown by vaccine efficacy studies, animal studies in mice and non-human

264

primates, and data from early use of convalescent plasma in elderly patients 4,5,13,14,21,22.

265

There is a lack of data on neutralising antibody immune responses following mRNA

266

vaccination in the elderly and no data on variants of concern in this group. In a clinical study

267

specifically looking at older adults vaccinated with BNT162b2 the GMT (geometric mean

268

titre) after first dose was 12 in a set of 12 subjects between ages of 65 and 85 years, rising to

269

149 seven days after the second dose 1. Furthermore, in the Moderna 1273 mRNA vaccine

270

study in older individuals (above 55 years), neutralisation was only detectable after the

271

second dose, whilst binding antibodies were detectable after both doses 23. In a randomised

272

phase 1 study on BNT162b1 in younger (18-55) and older adults (65-85), Li et al observed

273

lower virus neutralisation in the older age group at day 22 post first dose 24. These data

274

parallel those in aged mice where ChAdOx nCov-19 vaccine responses were reported as

275

being lower as compared to younger mice, and this was overcome by booster dosing25.

276
277

Here, in a substantial cohort of 140 individuals, we have shown not only an inverse

278

relationship between age and neutralising responses following first dose of BNT162b2, but a

279

more precipitous decline around the age of 80. Individuals 80 and above were prioritised for

280

vaccination in the UK and elsewhere as they represented the group at greatest risk of severe

281

COVID-1926. We found that around half of those above the age of 80 have a suboptimal

282

neutralising antibody response after first dose vaccination with BNT162b2, accompanied by

283

lower T cell responses compared to younger individuals. Individuals over 80 differed in four

284

main respects that could explain poorer neutralisation of SARS-CoV-2. Firstly, serum IgG

285

levels were lower, accompanied by a lower proportion of peripheral spike specific IgG+ IgM-

286

CD19+ B memory cells. Secondly, the elderly displayed lower SHM in the BCR gene.

287

Thirdly, the elderly had lower enrichment for public BCR clonotypes that are associated with

288

neutralisation. Fourthly, the elderly displayed a marked reduction in IL-2 producing spike

289

reactive CD4 T cells. Therefore possible explanations for poorer neutralising responses

290

include lower concentrations (quantity) and/or lower affinity antibodies (quality) due to B

291

cell selection, CD4 T cell help, or a combination of both.

292
293

Critically, we show that elderly individuals are likely at greater risk from VOC. When

B.1.1.7 and P.1 variant spike PV were tested against sera in this study, a greater proportion of

295

individuals in the over 80 age group lost all neutralising activity following first dose as

296

compared to the wild type. As expected, B.1.351, known to have the highest degree of

297

resistance to NAb27, did not appear to have preferential impact on the elderly after one dose,

298

because sera from all ages had poor activity. The lack of neutralising activity against VOC

299

following first dose in the elderly is of great concern in the current climate where variants are

300

expanding globally and countries are struggling to acquire adequate vaccine supplies to

301

ensure timely administration of both doses. We observed robust neutralising responses across

302

all age groups after the second dose.

303
304

Following the second dose, binding IgG and IgA antibodies to Spike increased, mirroring

305

levels seen in natural infection. Consistent with these data, the UK REACT study, a large,

306

observational community based study, has shown that the prevalence of IgG positivity was

307

34.7% 21 days after the first dose of BNT162b2 in those over 80 years, increasing to 87.8%

308

after the second dose28.

309
310

Although neutralising antibody responses appear critical, studies in rhesus macaques also

311

show that CD8 T cells may play a role in contributing to protection from SARS-CoV-2

312

disease when neutralising antibody levels are low14. We speculate that this may explain why

313

recent observational studies have demonstrated some effect against hospitalisation after 1

314

dose of the BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1nCoV-19 in the context of VOC 10,29-32. SARS-CoV-2

315

infection generates robust T cell responses to spike protein in the majority of individuals

316

post infection. The IL2 response is predominantly produced by CD4+ T cells and that IFN𝛾

317

production was seen in both spike specific CD4 and CD8+ T cell subsets33,34. By contrast,

318

and in agreement with Anderson et al for the 1273 mRNA vaccine23, we found that spike

319

specific IFN and IL-2 T cell responses to BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine were largely CD4 T

320

cell derived. Phase I/II clinical trials of adenovirus vectored SARS-COV-2 vaccines have

321

similarly showed a Th1 skewed response with elevated TNF , IL2 and IFN𝛾 being secreted

322

by both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells23,35-38.

323
324

We found that both IFN and IL-2 PBMC responses were significantly lower in the over 80

325

age group and did not increase after the second dose, similar to findings for ChAdOx139.

326

Parry et al also reported suboptimal IFN responses in over 80 year olds following two doses

327

of BNT162b2 (https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3816840). In particular it appeared that lower

328

IL2 responses in PBMC may reflect very low spike specific CD4 IL2 responses in the over

329

80 age group.

330
331

SARS CoV-2 mRNA vaccination has been shown to generate potent TFH and GC responses,

332

correlating with neutralisation40. Interactions between B-cells and T follicular helper (TFH) in

333

the germinal centre (GC) are needed for long-lived memory B cells/ plasma cells and high-

334

affinity, class-switched antibodies41,42. In our B cell repertoire analyses we explored

335

correlates for the impaired virus neutralisation by antibodies observed in a high proportion of

336

older individuals. We found that participants >80 had a lower mean somatic hypermutation in

337

class-switched BCRs, driven by the IgA1/2 isotype. There was a trend towards significant

338

correlation between IC50 and somatic hypermutation in class-switched and in IGHA BCR.

339

Our data hint towards a mechanism whereby impaired T cell responses, as indicated by our

340

data showing lower SARS-CoV-2 spike induced T cell cytokine production in the elderly,

341

could impair generation of high affinity, class-switched, potently neutralising antibodies. In

342

addition the lack of public BRC clones associated with neutralising antibodies in the elderly

343

may relate to altered selection of B cell clones.

344
345

Conclusion

346

In vitro virus neutralisation is increasingly recognised as the most significant correlate of

347

protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection4,5,13,14. Whilst significant public health impact of

348

vaccines is anticipated, and indeed has been demonstrated43, a significant proportion of

349

individuals above 80 appear to require the second dose to achieve virus neutralisation and are

350

disproportionately vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 variants after the first dose. Our data caution

351

against extending the dosing interval of BNT162b2 in the elderly population, particularly

352

during periods of high transmission and risk from variants that are less susceptible to

353

vaccine-elicited neutralising antibodies44-47. The mechanism of reduced neutralising

354

responses in the elderly needs to be further delineated in order to inform mitigation strategies.

Methods

378

Study Design

379

Community participants or health care workers receiving the first dose of the BNT162b2

380

vaccine between the 14th of December 2020 to the 10th of February 2021 were consecutively

381

recruited at Addenbrookes Hospital into the COVID-19 cohort of the NIHR Bioresource.

382

Participants were followed up for up to 3 weeks after receiving their second dose of the

383

BNT162b2 vaccine. They provided blood samples 3 to 12 weeks after their first dose and again

384

3 weeks after the second dose of the vaccine. Consecutive participants were eligible without

385

exclusion. The exposure of interest was age, categorised into 2 exposure levels- < 80 and ≥ 80

386

years. The outcome of interest was inadequate vaccine-elicited serum antibody neutralisation

387

activity at least 3 weeks after the first dose. This was measured as the dilution of serum required

388

to inhibit infection by 50% (ID50) in an in vitro neutralisation assay. An ID50 of 20 or below

389

was deemed as inadequate neutralisation. Binding antibody responses to Spike, Receptor

390

binding domain and Nucleocapsid were measured by multiplex particle-based flow cytometry

391

and Spike-specific T cell responses were measured by IFN and IL-2 FLUOROSPOT assays.

392

Measurement of serum autoantibodies and characterisation of the B cell receptor repertoire

393

(BCR) following the first vaccine dose were exploratory outcomes.

394
395

We assumed a risk ratio of non-neutralisation in the ≥80 years group compared with <80 years

396

group of 5. Using an alpha of 0.05 and power of 90% required a sample size of 50 with a 1:1

397

ratio in each group.

Statistical Analyses

408

Descriptive analyses of demographic and clinical data are presented as median and interquartile

409

range (IQR) when continuous and as frequency and proportion (%) when categorical. The

410

difference in continuous and categorical data were tested using Wilcoxon rank sum and Chi-

411

square test respectively. Logistic regression was used to model the association between age

412

group and neutralisation by vaccine-elicited antibodies after the first dose of the BNT162b2

413

vaccine. The effect of sex and time interval from vaccination to sampling as confounders were

414

adjusted for. Linear regression was also used to explore the association between age as a

415

continuous variable and log transformed ID50, binding antibody levels, antibody subclass

416

levels and T cell response after dose 1 and dose 2 of the BNT162b2 vaccine. The time interval

417

from vaccination to sampling was adjusted for. Bonferroni adjustment was made for multiple

418

comparisons in the linear correlation analyses between binding antibody levels, ID50, age and

419

T cell responses. The Pearson s correlation coefficient for linear data and Spearman s

420

correlation for non-linear data was reported. Statistical analyses were done using Stata v13,

421

Prism v9 and R (version 3.5.1).

Generation of Mutants and pseudotyped viruses

424

Wild-type (WT) bearing 614G and B.1.1.7 bearing mutations del-69/70, del-144,

425

N501Y, A570D, D614G, P681H, S982A, T716I and D1118H or K417N, E484K and N501Y

426

pseudotyped viruses were generated as previously described44. In brief, amino acid substitutions

427

were introduced into the D614G pCDNA_SARS-CoV-2_S plasmid as previously described48

428

using the QuikChange Lightening Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit, following the manufacturer s

429

instructions (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA). Sequences were verified by Sanger

430

sequencing. The pseudoviruses were generated in a triple plasmid transfection system whereby

431

the Spike expressing plasmid along with a lentviral packaging vector- p8.9 and luciferase

432

expression vector- psCSFLW where transfected into 293T cells with Fugene HD transfection

433

reagent (Promega). The viruses were harvested after 48 hours and stored at -80oC. TCID50 was

434

determined by titration of the viruses on 293Ts expressing ACE-2 and TMPRSS2.

436

Pseudotyped virus neutralisation assays

437

Spike pseudotype assays have been shown to have similar characteristics as neutralisation

438

testing using fully infectious wild type SARS-CoV-211. Virus neutralisation assays were

439

performed on 293T cell transiently transfected with ACE2 and TMPRSS2 using SARS-CoV-2

440

Spike pseudotyped virus expressing luciferase49. Pseudotyped virus was incubated with serial

441

dilution of heat inactivated human serum samples or sera from vaccinees in duplicate for 1h at

442

37 C. Virus and cell only controls were also included. Then, freshly trypsinized 293T

443

ACE2/TMPRSS2 expressing cells were added to each well. Following 48h incubation in a 5%

444

CO2 environment at 37°C, luminescence was measured using the Steady-Glo Luciferase assay

445

system (Promega). Neutralization was calculated relative to virus only controls. Dilution curves

446

were presented as a mean neutralization with standard error of the mean (SEM). 50%

447

neutralization- ID50 values were calculated in GraphPad Prism. The limit of detection for 50%

448

neutralisation was set at an ID50 of 20. The ID50 within groups were summarised as a

449

geometric mean titre (GMT) and statistical comparison between groups were made with Mann-

450

Whitney or Wilxocon ranked sign test.

452

Live virus serum neutralisation assays

453

A549-Ace2-TMPRSS2 cells were seeded at a cell density of 2.4x10^4/well in a 96 well plate

454

24hrs before inoculation. Serum was titrated starting at a final 1:50 dilution with live B.1

455

virus PHE2 (EPI_ISL_407073) isolate being added at an MOI 0.01. The mixture was then

456

incubating for 1hr prior to adding to the cells. 72hrs post infection the plates were fixed with

457

8% formaldehyde then stained with Coomassie blue for 30 minutes. The plates were washed

458

and dried overnight before using a Celigo Imaging Cytometer (Nexcelom) to measure the

459

staining intensity. Percentage cell survival was determined by comparing the intensity of the

460

staining to an uninfected well. A non-linear sigmoidal 4PL model (Graphpad Prism 9) was

461

used to determine the IC50 for each serum. The correlation between log transformed ID50

462

obtained from the pseudotyped virus and live virus systems were explored using linear

463

regression. Pearson s correlation coefficient was determined.

B Cell Receptor Repertoire Library Preparation

507

PBMC were lysed and RNA extracted using Qiagen AllPrep® DNA/RNA mini kits and

508

Allprep® DNA/RNA Micro kits according to the manufactures protocol. The RNA was

509

quantified using a Qubit. B cell receptor repertoire libraries were generated for 52 COVID-19

510

patients (58 samples) using as follows: 200ng of total RNA from PAXgenes (14ul volume)

511

was combined with 1uL 10mM dNTP and 10uM reverse primer mix (2uL) and incubated for

512

5 min at 70°C. The mixture was immediately placed on ice for 1 minute and then

513

subsequently combined with 1uL DTT (0.1 M), 1uL SuperScriptIV (Thermo Fisher

514

Scientific), 4ul SSIV Buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 1uL RNAse inhibitor. The

515

solution was incubated at 50 °C for 60 min followed by 15 min inactivation at 70 °C. cDNA

516

was cleaned with AMPure XP beads and PCR-amplified with a 5 V-gene multiplex primer

517

mix and 3 universal reverse primer using the KAPA protocol and the following thermal

518

cycling conditions: 1cycle (95°C, 5min); 5cycles (98°C, 20s; 72°C, 30s); 5cycles (98°C, 15s;

519

65°C, 30s; 72°C, 30s); 19cycles (98 °C, 15s; 60°C, 30s; 72°C, 30s); 1 step (72°C, 5 min).

520

Sequencing libraries were prepared using Illumina protocols and sequenced using 300-bp

521

paired-end sequencing on a MiSeq machine.

522
523

Sequence analysis

524

Raw reads were filtered for base quality using a median Phred score of >32

525

(http://sourceforge.net/projects/quasr/). Forward and reverse reads were merged where a

526

minimum 20bp identical overlapping region was present. Sequences were retained where over

527

80% base sequence similarity was present between all sequences with the same barcode. The

528

constant-region allele with highest sequence similarity was identified by 10-mer matching to

529

the reference constant-region genes from the IMGT database. Sequences without complete

530

reading frames and non-immunoglobulin sequences were removed and only reads with

531

significant similarity to reference IGHV and J genes from the IMGT database using BLAST

532

were retained. Immunoglobulin gene use and sequence annotation were performed in IMGT V-

533

QUEST, and repertoire differences were performed by custom scripts in Python.

576

unstimulated (media only) and positive control mix (containing anti-CD3 (Mabtech AB) and

577

Staphylococcus Enterotoxin B (SEB), (Sigma Aldrich)) at 37ºC in a humidified

578

579

the assay developed following the manufacturer s instructions. Developed plates were read

580

using an AID iSpot reader (Oxford Biosystems, Oxford, UK) and counted using AID EliSpot

581

v7 software (Autoimmun Diagnostika GmbH, Strasberg, Germany). Peptide specific

582

frequencies were calculated by subtracting for background cytokine specific spots

583

(unstimulated control) and expressed as SFU/Million PBMC.

CD4 and CD8 depletion from PBMC for subsequent FLUOROSpot analysis

586

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were depleted of either CD4+ or CD8+ T cells by MACS

587

using anti-CD4+ or anti-CD8+ direct beads (Miltenyi Biotec), according to manufacturer s

588

instructions, and separated by using an AutoMACS Pro (Miltenyi Biotec). Efficiency of

589

depletion was determined by staining cells with a CD3-FITC, CD4-PE, and CD8-

590

PerCPCy5.5 antibody mix (all BioLegend) and analyzed by flow cytometry.

PV after the first dose of Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccine by age. Cut off for serum neutralisation is the inhibitory dilution at which 50% inhibition of
infection is achieved, ID50 of 20. The probability is bound by 95% confidence interval. b. SARS-CoV-2 PV neutralisation by Pfizer BNT162b2
first and second dose vaccine sera. Data are shown as mean ID50 values for individuals after Dose 1 (n=138) and after Dose 2 (n=32).
Geometric mean with s.d is shown. Each point is a mean of technical replicates from two experiment repeats. c. Serum neutralisation of PV
after Dose 1 (blue) or dose 2 (red) by age-group <80 years (n=79), ≥80 years (n=59). c. Neutralisation curves for serum from six individuals
with reduced responses after first dose (blue) and increased neutralization activity after second dose (red) of Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccine
against pseudovirus expressing wild type Spike (D614G). Neutralisation curves are means of technical replicates, plotted with error bars
representing standard error of mean.d. diagram depicting spike mutations in variants of concern, along with number of sequences in GISAID
e. Impact of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern on neutralisation by Pfizer BNT162b2 dose 1 vaccine sera. WT (n=138), B.1.1.7 (n=135) Spike
mutant B.1.351 (n=82) Spike mutant, P.1 (n=82). Geometric mean titre and s.d are shown. f. The proportion of participant vaccine sera with
undetectable neutralistion of WT and Spike mutant (ID50 < 1 in 20 dilution of sera). WT (n=138), B.1.1.7 (n=135) Spike mutant; B.1.351
(n=82) spike mutant, P.1 (n=82) spike mutant. GMT with s.d are representative of two independent experiments each with two technical
repeats. Mann-Whitney test was used for unpaired comparisons and Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test for paired comparisons. pvalues * <0.05, ** <0.01, **** <0.0001, ns not significant, HS – human AB serum control, r– Pearson’s correlation coefficient, βslope/regression coefficient, p p-value. Bonferroni adjustment was made for multiple comparisons in linear regression.

public clones known to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 neutralisation via the CoV-AbDab database (Raybould et al.,
2020). Convergent clones were annotated with the same IGHV and IGHJ segments, had the same CDR-H3 region length
and were clustered based on 85% CDR-H3 sequence amino acid homology. A cluster was considered convergent with
the CoV-AbDab database if it contained sequences from post-vaccinated individuals and from the database.

Extended Data Figure 8: Autoantibodies and inflammatory markers in participants receiving at least one dose of the
Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccine and relationship to SARS-CoV-2 spike specific IgG and SARS-CoV-2 PV neutralisation.
(n=101). a. Heatmap of log2 transformed fluorescence intensity(FI) of 19 autoantibodies, positive (red), negative
(blue). b. Age in years by anti-MPO antibody positive (red) or negative (blue) status. Plotted is the mean age and s.d.
c. (n=100) IgG subclass responses to Spike post first dose Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccine comparing individuals with antiMPO antibody positive (red) or negative (blue) status. d. GMT with s.d of first dose Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccine sera
against wild type and B.1.1.7 Spike mutant SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped viruses by anti-MPO antibody positive (red) or
negative (blue) status. Ab+ antibody positive, Ab- antibody negative, MPO- myeloperoxidase, P – pvalue, WT- wild
type, B.1.1.7 Spike mutant with N501Y, A570D, !H69/V70, !144/145, P681H, T716I, S982A and D1118H.
e.Nonparametric rank correlation (Kendall’s tau-b) of wild type (WT), variant (B.1.17) and age (<>80 years) against
each of 53 cyto/chemokines. Heatmaps illustrate Tau-b statistic (left) and significance (right, –log10FDR).
