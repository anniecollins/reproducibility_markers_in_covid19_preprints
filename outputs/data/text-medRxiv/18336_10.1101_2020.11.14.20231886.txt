Abstract
The application, timing, and duration of lockdown strategies during a pandemic remain poorly quantified
with regards to expected public health outcomes. Previous projection models have reached conflicting
conclusions about the effect of complete lockdowns on COVID-19 outcomes. We developed a stochastic
continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) model with eight states including the environment (SEAMHQRDV), and derived a formula for the basic reproduction number, R0, for that model. Applying the 𝑅0 formula
as a function in previously-published social contact matrices from 152 countries, we produced the
distribution and four categories of possible 𝑅0 for the 152 countries and chose one country from each quarter
as a representative for four social contact categories (Canada, China, Mexico, and Niger). The model was
then used to predict the effects of lockdown timing in those four categories through the representative
countries. The analysis for the effect of a lockdown was performed without the influence of the other control
measures, like social distancing and mask wearing, to quantify its absolute effect. Hypothetical lockdown
timing was shown to be the critical parameter in ameliorating pandemic peak incidence. More importantly,
we found that well-timed lockdowns can split the peak of hospitalizations into two smaller distant peaks
while extending the overall pandemic duration. The timing of lockdowns reveals that a “tunneling” effect
on incidence can be achieved to bypass the peak and prevent pandemic caseloads from exceeding hospital
capacity.

Introduction
A cluster of viral pneumonia cases led to identification of a new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
first reported in Wuhan, China on December 31, 2019. Subsequent reports of human transmission [1] and
travel-related cases [2] seeded outbreaks in many other countries. The WHO declared a global pandemic,
Phase 6 emergency on January 30, 2020 [3].
Different country responses to early identified travel-related cases included quarantines and contact tracing
[4] to identify and isolate potentially infected individuals, as containment measures. As the outbreaks
developed, countries increased diagnostic testing of individuals with COVID-19 risk factors, respiratory
symptoms and influenza like illness. However, once widespread local community was confirmed,
transmission was present, frequently followed by discrete acceleration events [5], it rapidly overwhelmed
the ability of many public health departments to conduct effective contact tracing and that of the health care
system to take care of patients with critical, severe, and moderately severe illness; In response, many
jurisdictions adopted mitigation broader strategies to manage the outbreak and slow down the rate of
transmissions within the country such as social distancing, quarantines and lockdowns.
The surge in COVID-19 cases during the global pandemic put substantial strain on hospitals and intensive
care units in China and other countries [6]. Interventions in China showed that contact tracing with
quarantine, social distancing, and lockdowns to isolate cities and regions with community transmission was
effective. The interventions in China were encouraging for modulating and containing the COVID-19
outbreak.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) that limit contact between individuals are proven to be efficacious
in reducing COVID-19 transmission [7]. Contact limiting strategies include school closures, workplace
closures (e.g. work-from-home mandate), stay at home orders and restrictions (e.g. for individuals, regions
or entire countries), preventing gatherings (e.g. cancellation of larger events and smaller meetings), limiting
visitors to institutional settings (e.g. hospitals, long term care facilities and prisons), voluntary or
involuntary quarantine of potentially exposed individuals, quarantine of buildings, regions or lockdowns of
entire countries (e.g. stopping most border traffic and international air travel). Various intervention
strategies to reduce transmission can be utilized and are viewed as temporary public health measures [8].
Limiting contact is a strategy that attempts to decrease both the frequency and duration of contacts which
in turn reduces the basic reproduction number, R0, the average number of persons to whom one case
transmits the disease during his/her incubation period. Studies on social contact estimated that schools and
daycare centers were the most socially dense locations compared with offices and homes [9]. When school
closures and work-from-home strategies are activated, the transmission dynamics shift to the withinhouseholds contacts. In this regard, family structures, country population density, country population
demographics, and socioeconomics can affect the number of social contacts occurring within the home. In
addition, there is a problem of increased contact between individuals house-to-house, which may warrant a
complete lockdown within the home.
Modelling with data fitted to Wuhan’s lockdown in China revealed a positive effect reducing the contact
rate through isolation and quarantine that decreased and delayed COVID-19 infections [10]. However,
other research studies suggest ongoing uncertainty over whether lockdown measures are sufficient to
control 2019-nCoV [11].
To better understand the effect of lockdown dynamics for duration and timing, we created a stochastic
continuous-time Markov chain model to analyze different hypothetical lockdown scenarios for four

countries (Canada, China, Mexico, and Niger). The countries were chosen for their variation in social
contact rates and ordered by increasing contacts using a scale of differential contract rates based on 𝑅0 .
Methods and Model
Model Description
We used an SEAMHQRD-V disease transmission model to depict the spread of SARS-CoV 2 (the cause
of COVID-19) in the community, and within households. The model is constructed from a stochastic
continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) with eight states or compartments: susceptible (S), exposed (E),
infected but asymptomatic (A), mildly infected and symptomatic (M), severely infected, symptomatic and
hospitalized (H), detected and quarantined (Q), recovered (R), and dead (D) (Fig. 1). The equivalent number
of infected persons represented by deposition of virus particles by infected persons (A+M) in the
environment is denoted by V, with removal of virus from the environment by ρ. Compartments were split
into three age groups: children (0–18 years), denoted by a (c) subscript, adults (19–64 years) denoted by an
(a) subscript, and senior (65 years and more), denoted by an (s) subscript. The possible transitions of
individuals between compartments are represented by arrows with rates given above the arrows in Fig. 1.
The subpopulation sizes are denoted by 𝑁𝑐 , 𝑁𝑎 , and 𝑁𝑠 , respectively, and they add up to the total population
size 𝑁 which is assumed to be fixed. See the supplementary material (S1. Model Description) for full
description and Table S3 for definition of model’s parameters. We used the methods introduced by Allen
and van den Driessche [12] to derive 𝑅0 for the CTMC model by approximating it by a multi-type branching
process [12], see supplementary material (S2. The Basic Reproduction Number R 0 and Probability of
Extinction).
We used the CTMC to simulate different epidemiological measures and find their statistics. The first
measure was the actual incidence, defined to be the proportion of the newly infected individuals to the
population every day over the course of the epidemic. The second measure was the total attack rate, defined
as the fraction of people that contract the disease in an at-risk population over the epidemic period. The
third measure is hospital case load, defined to be the fraction of the population that is hospitalized for
COVID-19 treatment at any given time and find its peak. We used the total population as the denominator
for all of the measures so as to be able to compare between different counties with different population
sizes.

rates are indicated over the arrows. See Table S3 for definition of model’s parameters. The force of infection 𝛬𝑗 is

The social contact matrices used in the CTMC model were adapted from the study by Prem et. al. (2017)
[13], which projected the data from population-based contact diaries in eight European countries from the
POLYMOD study [14] to 144 other countries using a Bayesian hierarchical model that estimated age-andlocation-specific contact patterns for the different countries. Applying household-level demographic and
health survey data from the 152 countries to Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations, they produced five
different types of social contact rates for various settings: work, school, home, other and all. The resulting
social contact matrices were available for 5-year age increments from age 0 to 80.
To calculate the contact rates for our study for the assigned age groups of 0-18, 19-64 and 65+, we added
up the contact rates of all columns (of the consequents) of the matrices (see Supplementary Material S1)
representing age increments in each of these three age categories, and then averaged the totals across the
rows (of the antecedent) for the corresponding compiled age groups. We assumed that environmental
contact matrix is a proportion 𝑟 of the all-contact matrix. The home contact matrix was normalized by the
number of household members in each age group [15]. We obtained data about household sizes and
population sizes classified by age groups in different countries from the United Nations, Department of
Economic and Social Affairs, Population Dynamics [16].
We used the formula of 𝑅0 (calculated at β=3.5%) as a function in the contact matrices and demographics
to produce the distribution and four categories of 𝑅0 for the 152 countries (Fig. S1) [13]; and chose one
country from each quartile as a representative for each of four social contract categories. For this procedure,
it was assumed that the probability of infection is the same in all situations and places. Quartiles of 𝑅0 split
the countries into four groups (see S3. Countries Categorization for more details). We picked one country
from each one of the four categories, that would also fall in a different continent: Canada, China, Mexico,
and Niger; increasing from the lowest to the highest social contact category.
We used the tau-leap method [17] to simulate the stochastic CTMC model for 1,000 times. It is known that
the size of the epidemic has a chance to be zero in CTMC models [18], which we exclude given that attack
rates cannot, epidemiologically, have a value of zero and the COVID-19 virus has already a significant
potential to spread between individuals. In all the simulations, the initial number of infected individuals
was assumed to be one adult who is mildly infected. The list of parameters of the model, their description
and values are shown in Table S3. Some of the parameters were found in the literature or guesstimated by
experts and the rest of the parameters are found using calibration. We calibrated the model using the mean
scenario that was estimated by [19] to be 𝑅0 = 6.47 since the model’s structure in [19] is very close to our
model. That value was also very close to the mean value of the 152 values of 𝑅0 shown in Figure S1. We
used that value for all the chosen countries to factor out the effect of the reproduction rate of secondary
cases on the influence of the lockdown, thus allowing us to compare between the four countries.
To make a run-by-run comparison of the course of the epidemic with and without the lockdown, we
simulated the model using a fixed random seed for each one of the 1,000 runs. In all those runs, we assumed
that the only control measure is the complete lockdown starting before the peak of the actual incidence and
for a specified period. The comparison of the effect of the start of the lockdown was done using two
measures, which compute the relative reduction of measure X, RD(X), in 𝑅0 , the total attack rate, and peak
of hospitalization for the non-zero simulation runs with the following formula,

where 𝑋0 is the epidemiological quantity (𝑅0 , attack rate or peak of hospitalization) under no control
measure and 𝑋𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑑𝑜𝑤𝑛 is the same measure with the lockdown. The mean, median and 2.5% and 97.5%
percentiles of 𝑅𝐷 were calculated for the two measures. We also simulated the actual incidence and
hospitalized normalized by the total population sizes for visual comparisons.

The proportionality constant is dependent on the disease parameters, whereas the matrix 𝐁 depends on

strength of the virus and human culture and behavior.
The basic reproduction number 𝑅0 given in equation (3) shows direct dependence on the rates of viral
environmental shedding and the fraction of contacts individuals make with the environment. Decreasing
contact with the environment by use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and increasing environmental
decontamination by frequent cleaning, disinfection, hand washing will result in a decrease in basic
reproduction number. On the other hand, increasing rates of “removal” of both asymptomatic and mild
cases, operationalized through contact tracing, isolation and quarantine, will lower the denominators of the
term on the right side of equation (3) to a degree proportional to the spectral radius of the matrix 𝑩 in
equation (4). Strict adherence to social distancing and stopping insalubrious cultural habits by the three age
groups can decrease the likelihood of disease transmission (through β’s) resulting in shrinking 𝑅0 .

partial or full lockdowns.
A full lockdown results in a reduction in the basic reproduction number 𝑅0 by more than 64% and up to
85% (Fig. 2). We can conclude that with using this model, household contacts and demographics are among
the major factors contributing to 𝑅0 .

Figure 2. Histogram of percentage reduction in values of 𝑅0 for the 152 countries [13] calculated at β = 3.5% (see
equation (2)). The percentage reduction of the four selected countries are as follows: Canada 82%, China 76%, Mexico
74%, and Niger 73%.

The start and length of lockdown affects attack rates, and hospital flux (Fig. 3 and 4) with different degrees.
This is consistent with the various possible levels of reduction in the basic reproduction numbers as can be
seen in Fig. 2. While the magnitude of relative reduction is not the same for the four selected counties, the
consequences of timing and length of lockdown appears to be consistent. It appears that starting a complete
lockdown will have its optimal reduction on the total attack rate if it starts 5 days before the peak of the
actual incidence and lasting for 90 days. While starting a 90-days lockdown 30 days before the peak has a
small relative reduction of the total attack rate (Fig. 2), it reduces the peak of the actual incidence (Fig S4).
Shorter lockdowns seem to be of larger relative effect on the total attack rate if they start close enough to
the peak of the actual incidence.

Lockdown, however, has its maximum effect on the hospital case load if it starts 15 days to 20 days prior
to the peak of actual incidence, See Fig. 4. The timing is less consistent between the four countries but
shows an overall qualitative resemblance. It appears that a shorter than a 90-days lockdown can achieve the
goal of hospital case load reduction.

While the location of the peak of the proportion of the actual incidence of COVID-19 cases to the total
population is different for the four countries, the magnitudes of the peaks are very close, as shown in Fig.
5-8 (a), which might be an outcome of the contact matrices and demographics while keeping 𝑅0 constant.
Starting the lockdown 15 days before the actual incidence’s peak results in a tunneling effect of the
incidence curve as seen in the simulation runs and their average, Fig. 5-8 (b) (see also Fig. S4), which
resulted in a decrease in the magnitude of the attack rates. The tunneling effect appears as a theoretical
solution in environmental Kuznets curves of pollution emission [20]. Here it also results in dividing the
flux of cases arriving at hospitals into two distinct, smaller peaks which would allow hospitals to deal with
a smaller initial peak before restocking for the second smaller peak, Fig. 5-8 (c) and (d). Dividing the peak
of hospitalization into two smaller peaks creates a more manageable outbreak scenario. Thus, hospitals can
“divide and conquer” the expected larger peak of cases with a well-timed lockdown. The benefit of not
exceeding hospital capacity is decreased mortality (not explicitly modeled here).

While the effect of the length of the lockdown on the two measures is expected, the effect of its start is
subtle. In Fig. 9, we can see some transitions in the hospitalizations based on the decision to start the
lockdown according to the four timing options 20, 15, 10, and 5 days before the actual incidence peaks.
The model output shows the 15-days before the peak lockdown option to be the most effective for Canada
and China while the 20-days option seems best for Mexico and Niger.

Similarly, the actual incidence show transitions (Fig. S4) with the maximum effect on the peak happening
when the lockdown starts 15-20 days before the peak of the actual incidence. Simulations of the total attack
rates show reductions consistent with the results (Fig. S5-8)
Discussion
Continuous time Markov chain models are regularly used to model transmission of diseases. To date most
of the work done to model COVID-19 has used deterministic modelling which gives an approximation of
the mean of the stochastic epidemic curves [12, 21-23]. However, the deterministic curves will miss the
likely timing of the peak of incidence since averaging over values does not imply averaging over time. The
outputs of our carefully crafted simulations of the (stochastic) CTMC model demonstrate that the timing of
the lockdown relative to the epidemic peak is a key factor in controlling COVID-19 and prevent hospital
systems from becoming overwhelmed.

According to this CTMC model, countries with different social contact rates revealed that the optimal
starting time to decrease the total attack rate occurs when the lockdown begins about 5 days before the
actual peak of the epidemic, which is the peak of incidence. Benefits from lockdown in terms of relative
reduction in COVID-19 hospitalizations are also observed around 15-20 days before the epidemic peak.
This provides a limited window for public health decision-makers to mobilize and take full advantage of
lockdown as an NPI. Lockdowns appear to have a maximum effect if they start close to the actual peak of
incidence and last for three months.
Timing the start of a complete lockdown 30 days or more prior to the epidemic peak will have little
appreciable effect on reducing either the total attack rate or the peak of hospitalizations (as shown in Fig. 3
and 4). Accurate knowledge of the actual peak of incidence, not just of the reported cases may be required
for optimal control of the epidemic using lockdown as an intervention, but obtaining a realistic timing of
the peak and the actual incidence seem unattainable given the uncertainties involving the COVID-19
pandemic.
Starting the lockdown too early or too late can miss the chance of optimal benefit in controlling the disease.
The output of this model illustrates that likely there is an optimal window to start the lockdown and provide
maximum benefits for COVID-19 incidence and hospitalizations relative to the width of the 95% quartile
interval of the location of the peak. Interventions must take into consideration repercussions such as major
economic impacts, mental health consequences, and increased morbidity and mortality from non-COVID19 diseases [24]. Poor timing will result in a wasted lockdown effort with little impact on the outbreak
while incurring economic losses and psychological tolls to the public and healthcare workers during
extended isolation including response and lockdown fatigue [25].
While the decision of when to begin a lockdown will vary from one country to another, based on their
specific outbreak context, the knowledge of the location of the actual peaks makes a difference when
comparing the difference between starting at 5 days and 15 days before the peak. Knowledge about delays
in testing and reporting COVID-19 cases as well as accurate estimates of the epidemic are required to make
evidence-based decisions.
When faced with COVID-19, countries have used multiple NPIs concurrently in various combinations and
timings including lockdowns to reduce 𝑅0 [26]. Curbing 𝑅0 (see Equation 2) can be achieved by decreasing
the probability of transmission via social distance and changes in cultural norms. Limiting contact, frequent
cleaning and environmental disinfection as well as wearing masks and face coverings can also result in a
linear decrease in 𝑅0 .
Past studies showed that the strongest approach to limit social contacts is achieved through a partial or
complete lockdown; e.g. China used aggressive city and regional lockdowns to prevent transmission from
symptomatic and asymptomatic cases, thus flattening the epidemic curve and pushing the peak further into
the future. Use of strict lockdowns along with other NPIs allow healthcare systems to treat a more
manageable case load and gain time to plan, educate the public optimize the public health response while
advancing efforts for vaccine development [27].
We modelled hypothetical lockdowns four weeks longer than those used in Wuhan and other Chinese cities
without other NPIs, revealing that the timing of lockdowns is critical for its effectiveness in reducing actual
incidence [28-29]. Our modeling shows the benefit of an accurately timed lockdown which results in a
tunneling effect and can provide relief by avoiding overwhelming the hospitals, the public health response
capabilities and the health care system. However, the lockdown, while reducing case load, can be expected
to extend the duration of the epidemic. Extending its duration could result in unforeseen outcomes in

healthcare such as higher immediate healthcare costs (e.g. extended need for personal protective equipment,
testing kits, laboratory diagnostics, and increased intense hospital cleaning), decreased utilization of
healthcare services for other diseases resulting in worse outcomes and increased mortality (e.g., reduced
cancer screening or treatment for heart disease or diabetes), increased incidence of psychological outcomes
(e.g., suicide), and health care worker psycho-social impacts (stress, fatigue, and burn out) which may need
further evaluation when applying the results of this model.
One important limitation of compartmental models, as used in this paper, are less suitable to model
household infection dynamics since homes have limited numbers of individuals and once infected, they are
removed from the ongoing epidemic. This modeling weakness is difficult to incorporate by compartmental
models in general, so incidence may be overestimated. On the other hand, since household contact rates
tend to increase during lockdowns the resulting incidence might also increase, counter-balancing this issue;
which we did not incorporate in this model trying to overcome some of the inherent limitations to this type
of compartmental modeling of household transmission. Also, all timing scenarios in this paper are subjected
to the same limitation and so the qualitative rather than quantitative findings of the paper are to be
considered.
Finally, estimation of the pandemic peak by individual countries at the start of a pandemic with limited
epidemiological case data remains a significant challenge for public health officials. Accurately timing
lockdowns to achieve a “tunneling effect” is vital to maximize its benefits. Our results endorse that
hypothetical lockdown scenarios for representative countries (Canada, China, Mexico, and Niger) spanning
a continuum of increasing rates of social contact can all benefit from well-timed lockdown interventions.
