Summary
During the current COVID-19 pandemic, governments must make decisions based on a variety
of information including estimations of infection spread, health care capacity, economic and
psychosocial considerations. The disparate validity of current short-term forecasts of these
factors is a major challenge to governments. By causally linking an established epidemiological
spread model with dynamically evolving psychosocial variables, using Bayesian inference we
estimate the strength and direction of these interactions for German and Danish data of
disease spread, human mobility, and psychosocial factors based on the serial cross-sectional
COVID-19 Snapshot Monitoring (COSMO; N = 16,981). We demonstrate that the strength of
cumulative influence of psychosocial variables on infection rates is of a similar magnitude as
the influence of physical distancing. We further show that the efficacy of political
interventions to contain the disease strongly depends on societal diversity, in particular groupspecific sensitivity to affective risk perception. As a consequence, the model may assist in
quantifying the effect and timing of interventions, forecasting future scenarios, and
differentiating the impact on diverse groups as a function of their societal organization.
Importantly, the careful handling of societal factors, including support to the more vulnerable
groups, adds another direct instrument to the battery of political interventions fighting
epidemic spread.

Introduction
The current Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is more than a health crisis; it is
also an economic, social and, in many countries, political crisis. Governmental decisions to
fight
COVID-19 must consider a range of factors including infection spread, health care

worldwide dynamic context. Importantly, these variables influence each other and evolve
over time. The specific trajectory of these interactions will determine the consequences for
each nation (e.g., deaths, duration of lock-down, economic loss, etc.). Indeed, for the battle
against COVID-19 to be successful, it has been suggested to “inform and qualify action with
evidence from behavioral and cultural research” (1) to create high acceptance of and
compliance with measures, even after restrictions are lifted. While science offers this evidence
to inform policy making (2,3), the influence of psychosocial (PS) variables is not integrated into
epidemiological models to predict further disease transmission. Feeling risk of contracting the
disease but also other, more remote psychosocial constructs such as trust in the regulating
bodies and acceptance of policies (1) may be important to take up protective behavior (e.g.,
physical distancing, wearing a face mask). In current approaches the time invariance of these
behaviors is assumed and adapted when an intervention occurs (4). Any violation of model
assumptions reduces the predictive power of the model and limits its validity to short terms.
A potential interaction of psychosocial variables with mobility is such a violation: high
psychological strain felt during a lock-down may lead people to reject the preventative
measures, which is then related to increased mobility (5). Consequently, model parameters
need to be continuously updated to counter for the accumulating model errors (6, 7). As
governmental decisions and interventions need to be planned further ahead, the mechanistic
correction of the forecast model by integrating the interactions of PS variables with mobility
is crucial. Here we use the weekly cross-sectional COVID-19 Snapshot Monitoring (COSMO)
data (5, 8), which allow rapid and adaptive monitoring of psychosocial variables and gain a
real-time insight into the knowledge, perceptions, and behaviors of the population – the
"psychological COVID-19 situation" (9). Our objective is to improve the accuracy of longerterm predictions of epidemic spread models by integrating the influence of PS variables into
disease dynamics.

Integrating psychosocial variables in epidemic transmission model of COVID-19
Studies such as COSMO suggest that as PS variables change over time, behavioral responses
will change over a similar time scale. The temporal alignment of PS variables, mobility, and
infectious spread provides a framework that enables a causal analysis and testing of this
hypothesis (10). As a first step, we express the influence of PS variables upon behavior as a
causal hypothesis, where its coupling strength and direction is inferred from the empirical
data. Changes in behavior are expressed by modulation of the contact rate and quantified by
the mixing matrix 𝛽, which describes the number of infection-producing contacts per unit
time. R0 is the reproduction number of an infection and reflects the expected number of cases
directly generated by one case in a homogeneously mixed population where all individuals are
susceptible to infection (11). Both quantities, 𝛽 and R0, cannot currently be modified through
vaccination or other changes in population susceptibility, but can be modified by physical
distancing and other political interventions. These measures, however, are only effective if
large parts of the population comply with them. However, certain groups in the population
may have less resources and capacity to adapt and thus perceive different levels of affect, e.g.
due to age or variations in personal situations, such as a loss of income during a lock-down,
exposed working conditions, or restricted living space. We hypothesize that these groups will
show different degrees of acceptance of the measures, leading to variation in mobility and
ultimately disease transmission, which then again causally loops onto itself, contributing to
further changes in PS levels.

We formalize this emergent and dynamic process in Figure 1, using a compartmental SIR
model for infectious disease transmission comprising three populations of susceptible (S) and
infected (I) cases, as well as recovered or dead (R) cases. The total number of people is
N=S+I+R. As a government imposes political interventions J such as a lock-down, the mixing
matrix 𝛽 and the subsequent reproduction number R0 are reduced. Additional seasonal
modulations of 𝛽 add an important temporal variation to the epidemic transmission
mechanisms (12). We expand 𝛽 along two additional dimensions. First, 𝛽 can slowly evolve
over time as a consequence of modulations with the PS variables. The time scale separation
between infectious transmission and PS variables justifies the mathematical assumption of
weak coupling and its expression as an additive modulation (13). Second, groups within the
population can be differentially affected depending on their resources and capacity to adapt
to the situation (1), which we separate into vulnerable and resilient groups for the purposes
of the model. The affective state 𝜙$ of the i-th group is a longer lasting state, which is not
caused by a single stimulus but results from an accumulation of experiences. The
accumulation of PS effects, 𝑢$ , accrues over time due to prolonged restrictions, indicating the
capacity of the i-th group to adapt to the imposed political interventions. It varies with the
pandemic containment efforts such as physical distancing and travel restrictions, but also
economic factors such as business closures. Behavioral changes are absorbed in the mixing
matrix 𝛽$ , which establishes the link to the SIR variables and only depends on the political
interventions J and the affective state 𝜙$ of the i-th group.
To infer the strength and direction of the interactions, we use the COSMO data of Germany
and Denmark. The measures derived from the COSMO data sets were collected weekly from
early-March in Germany (overall N = 11,669) and started a few weeks later in Denmark (overall
N = 5,312). The measures focused mainly on the perception of the COVID-19 pandemic,
including: AFFECT variables that estimated how serious the threat was to the respondent (e.g.,
“Is the virus near to you?”; “Is the virus spreading fast?”; “Are you worried about the virus?”),
POLICY adjustments and acceptance (e.g., “Should the government close schools?”) and
TRUST in institutions (“Do you trust the performance of the government?”; “Do you trust the
healthcare system?”; see Appendix for more details on questions). Germany and Denmark
show both an early increase in the concern around the spread of the virus (AFFECT), and
agreement with the governmental interventions (POLICY), especially around school closings.
This peaked around March 23, when the country-wide lock-down was instituted in Germany
(Figure 2). This trend declined across time, indicating less concern with the pandemic, to levels
similar to where they stood when data were first collected. The data from Denmark were
collected starting immediately after the country-wide lock-down but showed a comparable
declining trend with more recent measurement waves. Figure 2 shows the time-aligned
COVID-19 infection and death rates over the same time period (4), and the mobility of the
population based on cell phone tracking indicating sharply reduced mobility during the
lockdown and then increasing mobility as AFFECT and POLICY declined (14).

Psychosocial (PS) variables modulate human mobility through changes of the mixing matrix 𝛽$ . As the perceived
consequences of political interventions, such as lock-down effects, accrue, the subsequent accumulation changes
the affective state 𝜙$ of the i-th sub-population. 𝛽$ affects 𝜙$ through the influence 𝑓$ of accumulated PS variables
and 𝜙$ affects 𝛽$ through the influence 𝑔$ , e.g., affective risk perception. The index i signals group-specific
variation of parameters and variables across the whole population, defining a group structure of vulnerable vs.
resilient groups with varying resources and capacity to adapt. Changes in the mixing matrix 𝛽$ directly affect the
dynamics of the infectious disease in the SIR model.

Figure 2. Data available for Germany and Denmark from February 15th to early of May 2020. In the first two
rows, estimates for daily infections (4) and reproduction number R0 are presented as time varying means and
standard deviations. Third row shows three selected variables from the AFFECT group in the COSMO surveys (see
Appendix for more details; higher values indicate that COVID-19 was seen as something one does not think about
all the time, rather not terrifying, and something not to worry about); their weighted mean (derived from PCA)
labeled as COSMO(t) is used in the model inversion. The last row presents the scatter plots of the Google mobility
report overlaid with lines marking the 7-day weighted moving averages, where the mean of the blue "retail and
recreation" variable is used in the model inversion.

Sampling of psychosocial and behavioral interactions during COVID-19
In order to assess the strength, direction, and significance of the coupling of PS variables on
the time-varying reproduction number R0, we submit the above extended SIR model with PS
interactions to Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Bayesian inference. Three parameters are
inferred: 𝛾 and 𝑐 are the strength and direction of the couplings 𝑔$ and 𝑓$ , respectively (Figure

1), and 𝛤 is the time scale of PS accumulation. For simplicity we dropped the group-specific
indices of 𝛾 and 𝑐, as we do not have access to group-specific mobility data from Google.
Figure 3 shows the results of the inference and the data used in the process. The two top rows
show the time series for the reproduction number R0(t) estimates (4) for Germany (DE) and
Denmark (DK), respectively, and the corresponding fit of the model as lines with the same
color scheme. The bottom row shows posterior distributions for model parameters of interest
along with the priors (in grey) placed on those parameters. While in Bayesian terms, the
coupling strength 𝛾 is well identified by the data of both Denmark and Germany, 𝛤, 𝑐 are
identified strongly only for data from Germany. For Denmark these posteriors follow the prior,
which are likely due to the lack of COSMO data during the onset of confinement in Denmark.
As our primary goal is to determine whether 𝛾 is non-zero, i.e., PS factors have an effect on
reproduction rate, we implement our null hypothesis as a normal prior on 𝛾, centered at 0.1,
i.e., a small effect. MCMC sampling from the posterior distribution allow the data to then
identify 𝛾, 𝛤, 𝑐. The point estimates (medians) of 𝛾 are 0.21 and 0.23 for Germany and
Denmark, respectively, and 95% confidence intervals are (0.17, 0.25) and (0.18, 0.30) for
Germany and Denmark, respectively. This indicates that PS variables significantly impact the
reproduction rate with a non-zero and positive coupling strength, i.e. the less stress people
felt about COVID-19, the higher R0. This defines a baseline, which allows individual
parametrization of the models for Germany and Denmark.

rate estimates (see Fig 2), for Germany (DE) and Denmark (DK) in blue and orange circles, respectively, and the
fit of the model as lines with the same color scheme. Middle: time series are shown for COSMO AFFECT data, for
Germany and Denmark in blue and orange circles, respectively, and the fit of the model as lines with the same
color scheme. Lower values indicate higher negative affect such as more fear and worries due to the Coronavirus.
Bottom: MCMC posterior distributions for key model parameters (𝛾: coupling strength of 𝑔$ ; 𝛤: time scale of
psychosocial accumulation; c: coupling strength of 𝑓$ ) for Germany and Denmark (blue and orange histograms,
respectively) and their respective priors (grey lines). On the left, the histograms of posterior samples for 𝛾 for
both countries, which deviate significantly from the prior (grey line); the data thus identify a strong and robust
effect of PS factors on SIR dynamics. Similar effects are seen for 𝛤 and 𝑐 for Germany, while Denmark follows the
prior on these parameters likely because of missing COSMO data at the onset of confinement.

Exploring the effects of PS variation on pandemic spread
We initialize each model with its respective past values for epidemic, mobility, and PS
variables and provide simulations for the upcoming months. To estimate robustness of the
forecast simulations and sensitivity upon the inferred parameters, we run simulations for all
values of coupling parameters sampled from the posterior distributions. The panels of Figure
4 show a comparison of simulations for the scenarios with and without PS coupling, displaying
the forecast trajectory evolution until April 2021 for the number of infected individuals I,
reproduction number R0, affective state 𝜙$ , and estimated strength of political interventions
J. The left column displays the situation for Germany, the right for Denmark. Further
differentiation comprises group structure as indexed by i, simulating the population into
groups of vulnerable and resilient based on different levels of PS variables in response to

the cumulative impact before the relaxation on 14/04 and before the predicted intervention in autumn; and dark
green is the predicted impact in autumn 2020, separated per group.

The seasonality of transmission (12) is included in the simulations where more transmissions
are assumed in autumn/winter than in spring/summer. Together, PS variables and seasonality
cause the predicted epidemic wave in autumn/winter of 2020 to be larger than the previous
one in spring 2020, despite the same stringency level of lock-down. This effect is also partly
responsible (together with the government interventions) for the lower level of infections
observed during May and June 2020 than later on in autumn. For every simulation of the SIR
model without PS variables (magenta dashed lines in Figure 4A), the efficacy of political
interventions J is overestimated. When comparing the forecast epidemic spread with and
without PS coupling (𝛾=0), the political intervention J would have proven sufficient to control
the epidemic spread in the latter case, but not the former, because the PS variables cause a
surge of infections towards the second part of 2020. Even though the mean inferred impact
of the PS subsystem is slightly lower for Germany than for Denmark, 𝑅1 and the second
infection wave related to the seasonality is predicted to be larger in Germany. The sensitivity
of the simulations to the choice of parameters is explored in Figure 4B. Here the coupling
parameters 𝛾 are drawn from the posterior distributions for a sample of 4,000 model
realizations for each country, and then used in the simulations with all other parameter
settings equal. The shaded areas indicate a confidence interval of 95%. All simulated
trajectories show qualitatively the same behavior, that is a surge of infection towards the end
of 2020. To provide a quantitative impression of the strength of PS coupling as compared to
lock-down and seasonal variation, Figure 4C shows a comparison of the impact of different
interventions with the seasonality and the PS influence, illustrated for the case of Denmark.
Analysis for Germany provides the same results and is provided in the appendix Fig S2. The
inclusion of group structure into the PS coupling generally enhances its strength, where more
heterogeneity cause stronger PS effects (see also appendix Fig S1 for further elaboration). The
impact is computed as the difference of cumulative infections with and without cause
(intervention, seasonality, and PS variables). Given the cumulative nature of PS effects, the
effect strength has been inferred for a particular time after the onset of the cause, in particular
the cumulative impact of PS is shown before the relaxation on 14/04 and before the predicted
intervention in autumn (light green); furthermore, the cumulative impact of group structure
is also shown (dark green), clearly demonstrating its epidemic spread-reinforcing effect.
Political interventions via mobility restrictions show the strongest effect, seasonality is factor
2 smaller than mobility constraint, and a factor 3 to 4 larger than PS factors.

Grouping PS variables in the COSMO data
Given the importance of the group structure on the relation between PS variables and SIR
suggested by the model, we further analyzed the COSMO survey data to determine if
significant grouping variables could be extracted. We tested age (young, middle, and old age),
sex, and education (three levels) and compared the aggregate PS variables across all available
waves using multivariate Partial Least Squares (PLS) analysis (15, 16). Employment status and
household income were less consistently collected so were not considered for this analysis. In
both German and Danish data, differences based on sex (Figure 5) and age (Supplementary
Figure S1) were observed. Differences related to education were less reliable but existent. We
also observed that the aggregate PS measure was reliably related to subjective psychological

stress and resilience in a subset of the COSMO data, suggesting the aggregate captured
broader psychosocial aspects beyond risk perception (see Appendix Fig S4). For Germany, data
collection started earlier and shows an initial overlapping transient with a faster rebound for
males than for females (Figure 5 left), resulting in a group difference which remains preserved
as time evolves. The same situation is observed for Denmark, even more pronounced (Figure
5 right), but without the initial transient as data collection started later. The interaction of age
and sex was not significant, indicating these were additive factors in these data. Older adults
and females showed larger overall values on the PS effect, suggesting these groups felt higher
affective risk and that the COVID-19 pandemic was more of a crisis relative to younger groups
or males.

PS Indicators suggests increase in affect risk perception and great institutional and policy trust in March, followed
by a general relative reduction.

Discussion
Although mechanisms of COVID-19 transmission are indiscriminate, this may not extend to a
complex society fighting epidemic spread (17). Societies have a rich inter-individual variability,
different cultures, wealth distribution, and ways of functioning, but most epidemic models
describe the dynamics of a homogeneous population in different disease stages. The model
parameters absorb all properties characterizing the diversity of society including psychosocial
factors. With the introduction of psychosocial coupling in epidemic disease models, the
consideration of effects linked to societal diversity becomes possible.
We estimated the strength and direction of psychosocial causes within a causal inference
framework and demonstrated their effect upon the infectious spread to be smaller, but on a
similar scale of magnitude as current political interventions (approx. factor 8 smaller than lockdown effects and social distancing) and seasonal variation (approx. factor 4-5 smaller). In
particular, affect variables that estimated how serious the threat was to the respondent
provide strong evidence for the causal effect of psychosocial factors on mobility and
subsequently infectious spread. Our cause-effect analysis considered minor parametric
changes due to psychosocial variation, but has the capacity to integrate a large range of multidimensional data including societal, national and cultural differences, political strategies, and
trust in the government and media. For instance, multidimensional approaches could
integrate additional psychological and sociocultural indicators, affecting the mixing matrix,
thereby establishing a battery of mutually dependent behaviors. Given the here estimated
size of psychosocial causes, the synergy of these interactions may likely reach scales that
cannot be ignored in epidemic spread. Furthermore, heterogeneity within a society generates
groups that are not equally affected by the same political intervention. The group structuring
differences are plotted in Figure 5 and supplemental figures, demonstrating that a highly
heterogeneous society would show acceleration and augmentation of infections across the
entire population due to group structure (Figure S1). Despite the fact that the resilient
population experiences no change in its affective state, the uniform mixing of the populations
causes increases of total numbers of infections in both groups, vulnerable and resilient. A
detailed quantitative understanding of these effects provides an added means to guide
political decisions to influence the infectious spread by considering parameters linked to
demographic factors of societal organization. In the continuum spanned by group
heterogeneity and timing of interventions, the choice of the best lock-down duration will
depend on the heterogeneity within the social structure and allow the optimization of political
interventions for a given society, and thus minimize economic damage while respecting the
efficiency for epidemic transmission control. This is particularly important as interventions
have optimal working domains (such as lock-down strength or duration), but outside of these
windows they are inefficient. For example, in Figure S1A for Denmark, showing that extending
lock-down durations do not alter the trajectory of epidemic spread significantly. Alternatively,
the same mechanism in the our model may be used to increase the efficacy of political
interventions by changing societal factors, in particular reducing societal heterogeneity and
increasing support to the more vulnerable groups (1).

Partly because of a lack of specific data in the COSMO surveys, we have left explicit economic
factors aside in this discussion, although such factors would be relevant to the grouping
structure. It has been suggested that psych-socio-economic variables such as income,
education, and ethnicity play an important role in the transmission of infectious diseases (18–
20), not only because they reflect resilience, but also because they influence the adoption of
protective behaviors during pandemics (21). As a consequence, models taking into
consideration PS-SIR interactions can provide stronger support for political interventions that
support less resilient groups socially and economically as this is a factor in reducing
heterogeneity (22, 23). The model framework also underscores that psychological knowledge
from personality and health psychology can be put to very concrete use in a crisis (24). Future
efforts should quantitatively assess the impact of communication and behavioural
interventions that address PS factors to enhance compliance.
The COVID-19 pandemic is exacerbating existing global and national inequalities, which
typically hit the most vulnerable groups hardest (25, 26). The focus of policymakers has been
on containing the spread of COVID-19 and mitigating the socioeconomic effects of the
pandemic. Our findings demonstrate that addressing these vulnerabilities nation- or even
worldwide through policy action (for instance, temporary basic income strategy (17, 27, 28)
may not only be a mean to fight the socioeconomic consequences of COVID-19, but also
represent a mean to directly fight its spread across all groups, both vulnerable and resilient,
through non-pharmaceutical actions containing the disease.

Methods

Model
We express the influence of 𝜙$ and 𝛽$ by the coupling functions 𝑓$ (𝑢$ , 𝐽, 𝜙$ ) and 𝑔$ (𝜙$ , 𝐽, 𝛽$ ),
which shall be inferred from the data. As a first step in model building, we recognize
similarities with many physical and biological systems, which are coupled indirectly through a
slowly evolving dynamic medium. Such slow modulations of a coupling medium are effectively
equivalent to a linear weak coupling of the dynamic systems, prescribing their interaction
around a working point as additive in a first approximation, but leaving the mathematical form
of the actual interaction functions themselves open. We harness this effect to extend the
transmission dynamics of the SIR model to include psychosocial interactions and infer the
precise form of the influence functions using Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) methods.
The full set of equations reads:

where the coupling functions 𝑔$ (𝜙$ , 𝐽, 𝛽$ ) and 𝑓$ (𝐽, 𝛽$ , t) affect the growth rates of the mixing
matrix 𝛽$ and affective state 𝜙$ . The back-coupling of 𝛽$ on 𝜙$ is communicated via an
accumulation of lock-down effects, aka deviations from normal mobility, through an auxiliary
variable 𝑢$ . For both types of interactions, the political intervention J is included in the
coupling and subject to the inference. The coupling function 𝑓$ is assumed to increase linearly
and then saturates at a maximal value of 1, whereas 𝑔$ shows the same behavior but remains
restricted to the linear signal range. The strength and direction of the coupling is equivalent
to the scale and sign of 𝛾$ and 𝑐$ of the couplings 𝑔$ and 𝑓$ , respectively, subject to inference
from empirical data using a stochastic model (see below). As we will not discuss group-specific
mobility changes due to changes in PS variables, we drop the index of 𝛾$ , leading to the
following closed loop equations:

ḃ $ = -( bi − b0 ) − 𝐽bi − 𝛾 ∙ (𝜙$ − 𝜙1 )
𝜙̇$ = −(𝜙$ − 𝜙1 + ℎ𝐽) − 𝑐$ tanh(2𝑢$ )
u̇ $ = −𝛤$ (bi − b0 )

where 𝑢$ = 0 for 𝐽 = 0, and during the relaxation of restrictions 𝑢$ is reset such that 𝑢$ (𝑡) =
tanhLM (𝑢(𝑡 − 1)(𝐽(𝑡)/𝐽(𝑡 − 1))P ). Here Γ$ <<1 reflects the time scale separation, that is both
mobility via 𝛽$ and affective state via 𝜙$ evolve on a time scale of the order of 1, whereas PS
effects accumulate on a time scale of the order of Γ$ . To include the impact of seasonality on
the transmission ability of the virus (12), we adapt sinusoidal modulation of 𝛽1 with a period
of one year and the peak being in Mid-January for the northern hemisphere. The seasonally
varying 𝛽1 (𝑡) hence reads:
𝛽1 (𝑡) = 𝛽1 −

with 𝐽Q being the magnitude of the variation that depends on the latitude and the climate. For
the both Germany and Denmark, it is fixed at 40%, which is the level predicted for New York
(12).
The statistical model was implemented in v2.22.1 of the Stan probabilistic programming
