Abstract
The role of mathematical models in controlling infectious diseases cannot be overemphasized. COVID-19 is a
viral disease that is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which has no
approved vaccine. The available control measures are non-pharmacological interventions like wearing face
masks, social distancing, and lockdown which are being advocated for by the WHO. This work assesses the
impact of non-pharmaceutical control measures (social distancing and use of face-masks) and mass testing on
the spread of COVID-19 in Nigeria. A community-based transmission model for COVID-19 in Nigeria is
formulated with observing social distancing, wearing face masks in public and mass testing. The model is
parameterized using Nigeria data on COVID-19 in Nigeria. The basic reproduction number is found to be less
than unity( 𝑅0 < 1) when the compliance with intervention measures is moderate (50% ≤ 𝛼 < 70%) and the
testing rate per day is moderate (0.5 ≤ 𝜎2 < 0.7) or when the compliance with intervention measures is strict
(𝛼 ≥ 70%) and the testing rate per day is poor (𝜎2 = 0.3). This implies that Nigeria will be able to halt the
spread of COVID-19 under these two conditions. However, it will be easier to enforce strict compliance with
intervention measures in the presence of poor testing rate due to the limited availability of testing facilities and
manpower in Nigeria. Hence, this study advocates that Nigerian governments (Federal and States) should aim
at achieving a testing rate of at least 0.3 per day while ensuring that all the citizens strictly comply with wearing
face masks and observing social distancing in public.

1. Introduction
Mathematical models are logical descriptions of real-life phenomena using mathematical techniques and
language. The process of developing a mathematical model is referred to as mathematical modeling [1]. Most
of these models formulated are prototypes of real-life occurrences arising from science and engineering,
physical system, psychology, medicine, economics and virtually all aspect of human life. These models also
answer questions that emanate from changes in the behavior of the infectious organism to proffer solutions to
the infections. The models use basic assumptions and mathematical approaches to determine the parameters
that drive the infections and use them to proffer solutions for treatments and preventions including vaccine
production [2].

Over the years, mathematical models have been tested and proven to be one of the efficient and reliable tools
used in proffering control and mitigation measures to epidemics and pandemics of infectious diseases. In
modeling infectious diseases, mathematical models provide practical and factual guides useful in making
decisions on health policies especially concerning controlling or mitigating the virulence of infectious
organisms. It can also advise health-decisions such as cost-effectiveness and optimal control of containment
and intervention measures [2, 3].
The coronavirus disease 2019 simply referred to as COVID-19, is a viral disease that was first reported in
Wuhan China in 2019 [4]. It is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
It has a high rate of infectivity but a low mortality rate when compared with the outbreaks of the Middle East
Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) 2012 and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) 2003 [5, 6]. It is known
to spread through exposure to the droplets from infected persons during coughing and sneezing. As for now,
Covid-19 has neither known vaccine nor specific treatments [7]. The World Health Organization (WHO)
declared COVID-19 a global pandemic in March 2020 [4].
This pandemic has disrupted activities all over the world and forced many countries to reset their economic
priorities [3, 8]. Different control policies recommended by the WHO such as lockdown, quarantine, isolation,
social distancing and restriction of the movement were implemented by the governments of many countries to
halt the spread of COVID-19 [4, 9, 10]. Sadly, these control policies have caused economic down-turn,
mortalities and morbidities, inflation, high rate of crime, lawlessness, and hunger in many countries [10, 11].
The WHO and researchers have stated that COVID-19 will remain in the world until there is a vaccine [12, 13].
Though, the disease emanated from China, it spread rapidly to Europe, America, Asia, Australia and Africa
within two months. As of May 13, 2020, every African country has recorded an infection, Lesotho being the
last [14]. As at 7:00 GMT on June 7, 2020, Africa had a total of 492,805 confirmed cases; 244,104 active cases;
227,204 discharge/recovered persons and 11,659 mortality due to COVID-19. South Africa is the most affected
country, with Egypt and Nigeria coming second and third respectively [9, 14].
Nigeria recorded her first case on February 27, 2020, from an Italian immigrant. Within four months the country
recorded as at July 7, 2020, about 29,286 confirmed cases; 16,804 active cases, 11,828 discharges and 654
deaths [9]. The government of Nigeria implemented various control policies as advocated by the WHO to halt
the spread of COVID-19, yet the country is still reporting outrageous new cases daily [9]. These daily new cases
have been attributed to either incompatibility of the control measures with Nigerian socioeconomic environment
or error on the part of stakeholders [10, 11]. For instance, the enforcement of total or partial lockdown and
shutdown of humans and the economies in the entire country especially Lagos state (the most populated and
industrial state in the country), Abuja the Federal Capital Territory (the seat of administrative power of the
country), Kano (the commercial centre of Northern Nigeria) and Ogun state (another industrial state in southwestern Nigeria) except for essential workers (like Food vendors, the media, healthcare workers, law
enforcement agencies, etc) caused a drastic decline in the gross domestic product of the country. Other
consequences include; strangulation of small and medium enterprises, increase in crime due to hardship,
inflation due to scare resources available and poverty in the country. The attitude of the citizens towards the
disease is frustrating the fight of COVID-19 in the country: many people still believe the disease does not kill
Africans, some believe that ‘COVID-19 is just a scam to enrich some cabal’ [11]. Many are still
organizing/attending banned public gatherings, while many are still not adhering to basic safety precautions of
wearing face-mask and washing of hands with running water or use of hand sanitizers [8, 10, 11].

Few researchers have attempted to mathematically model the Nigerian scenario in a bid to control and mitigate
COVID-19 in the country. The work of Madubueze et al. [3], is one of the very few mathematical models of
COVID-19 that seeks to consider the optimal control analysis of some of these control/containment measures
advocated by WHO. Their result revealed that the combined implementation of quarantine, isolation and public
health education will greatly mitigate the virus if timely implemented. However, the study did not incorporate
testing for COVID-19. Iboi et al. [8] presented a mathematical model and analysis of COVID-19 to assess the
impact of face-mask in the COVID-19 spread in Nigeria. Their model also revealed that COVID-19 will be
eliminated in Nigeria if the wearing of face-mask in public is complemented in Nigeria with a social distancing
strategy. Although all the available data on COVID-19 in Nigeria was utilized, the study did not incorporate
testing for COVID-19 in their model. Okuonghae and Omane [10] formulated a mathematical model of COVID19 to assess the impact of non-pharmacological control measures such as social distancing, use of face-mask
and case detection (contact tracing and subsequent testing). Their findings revealed that with intensified disease
case detection rate and at least 55% of the population adhering to the observance of social distancing and the
use of face-mask in public, the disease will eventually die out. However, their model analysis utilized the data
on COVID-19 cases in Lagos State alone. While Ibrahim and Ekundayo [11] outlined the importance and the
need for mathematical epidemiologists in times such as this, and the general misconstrued perception of
COVID-19 in Nigeria. Their findings straightened the wrong perceptions and attitudes of most Nigerians
towards the disease, emphasized the need for total adherence to the control/mitigation measures recommended
by the government, and also affirmed the needs for mathematical models as the most urgent and necessary tools
needed to effectively control/mitigate COVID-19 in Nigeria.
From the literature the authors were able to assess, none studied the impact of the non-pharmaceutical control
measures (social distancing and wearing face-masks) and testing rates on COVID-19 using all the available data
in Nigeria. The study done on Lagos state may not capture the true picture of the Nigerian scenario since
COVID-19 has spread to all the states in Nigeria. Therefore, this study will assess the impact of nonpharmaceutical control measures (social distancing, use of face-masks) and testing rate on the spread of
COVID-19 in Nigeria.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2, is devoted to the formulation of the model and the
computation of and interpretation of the basic reproduction number are presented in Section 3. In Section 4,
numerical simulations are carried out to display the effect of the testing rate and intervention measures on
COVID-19 dynamics. Discussion is described in Section 5 while Section 6 is the conclusion.
2. Model Formulation
In this section, the formulation of a deterministic community-based transmission model for COVID-19 in
Nigeria is presented. The total population, 𝑁(𝑡), at time, 𝑡, is divided into subpopulations; Susceptible
population, 𝑆(𝑡), Exposed population, 𝐸(𝑡), Infected population, 𝐼(𝑡), Isolated Infected individuals through
mass testing, 𝐼𝐽 (𝑡), Infected individuals that escaped mass testing, 𝐼𝑁𝑇 (𝑡), Hospitalized infectious population,
𝐻(𝑡), and Recovered individuals, 𝑅(𝑡).
The human population at any given time, 𝑡, is given by
N(𝑡) = S(𝑡) + E(𝑡) + I(𝑡) + IJ (𝑡) + INT (𝑡) + H(𝑡) + R(𝑡)
(1)
The entire population is assumed to be constant, hence there is no immigration or emigration due to border
closure, birth and natural death within the pandemic is negligible. The Susceptible population, 𝑆(𝑡), exits the
compartment due to the force of infection at the rate, 𝜆.

with 𝛼 ∈ (0,1) as the intervention measures which reduce the

transmission between the susceptible individuals and infected individuals. These intervention measures include
wearing a face mask and social distancing. The parameters, 𝜂1 , 𝜂2 , 𝜂3 are the modification parameters for the
subpopulation, INT (𝑡), ITP (𝑡), and H(t) respectively with 𝜂1 > 𝜂2 , 𝜂3 . The parameters, 𝜂2 , 𝜂3 are associated
with the hygiene consciousness of the infected individuals that know their status that is detected and the
hospitalized/isolated individuals.
The Exposed compartment gains population from the infected susceptible individuals at the force of infection
rate, 𝜆. They exit the exposed population after the incubation period of the virus, which is 5 – 6 days and become
infected at a rate, 𝜎. This is given by
𝑑𝐸

= 𝜆𝑆 − 𝜎𝐸. .

𝑑𝑡

The Infected compartment, 𝐼(𝑡), gains population from the Exposed individuals at the rate, 𝜎. Mandatory mass
testing is introduced in the Infected population as a diagnostic measure. This is to fish out infected individuals
in the population especially those asymptomatic infected that are not aware of their status. A proportion, 𝑝 ∈
[0,1] of the infected individuals know their status through mass testing a rate, 𝜎2 , and are isolated while the
proportion, (1 − 𝑝), of the infected population escaped the mass testing at a rate, 𝜎1 . This yields
𝑑𝐼
𝑑𝑡

= 𝜎𝐸 − (1 − 𝑝)𝜎1 𝐼 − 𝑝𝜎2 I.

On the other hand, the Infected individuals that escaped mass testing, 𝐼𝑁𝑇 (𝑡), gains population from the
proportion, (1 − 𝑝), of the infected individuals, at a rate, 𝜎1 . Some of them (symptomatic infected) becomes
hospitalized at the progression rate, 𝑘, while some die of the virus at a rate, 𝜆1 . The asymptomatic infected
individuals among them recover through a boost in their body immunity at a rate, 𝛾1 .
𝑑𝐼𝑁𝑇
𝑑𝑡

= (1 − 𝑝)𝜎1 𝐸 − (𝑘 + 𝛾1 + 𝜆1 )𝐼𝑁𝑇 .

The Isolated Infected compartment, 𝐼𝐽 (𝑡), gains population from the proportion, 𝑝, of the infected individuals,
at a testing rate, 𝜎2 . They are isolated at home or a facility for observation of symptoms. The asymptomatic
among them recovered at the rate, 𝛾2 , while the symptomatic are hospitalized at the rate, 𝜃, with the probability,
𝜌, of developing symptoms. This gives
𝑑𝐼𝐽
𝑑𝑡

= 𝑝𝜎2 I − (𝜌𝜃 + 𝛾2 )𝐼𝐽 .

The Hospitalized infectious compartment, 𝐻(𝑡), gains population from the infected individuals that miss mass
testing at a rate, 𝑘, and the Isolated infected individuals that become symptomatic at a rate, 𝜃, and 𝜌, the
probability of developing symptoms. Some people in the hospitalized compartment recovers at the rate, 𝛾3 ,
while some died of the disease at the rate, 𝜆2 .
𝑑𝐻
𝑑𝑡

= 𝜅𝐼𝑁𝑇 + 𝜃𝐽 − (𝜆2 + 𝛾3 )H.

The Recovered compartment, 𝑅(𝑡), gains population from the infectious individuals that escape testing, the
isolated infected individuals and the hospitalized individuals at the respective rates, 𝛾1 , 𝛾2 , and 𝛾3.

The following are the assumptions of the model.
i.

iii.
iv.
v.
vi.

The model assumes that COVID-19 is an epidemic, hence demographic processes of birth and natural
death are negligible during the epidemic.
The model assumes a constant population during the epidemic since borders have been closed (i.e. no
immigration or emigration), hence the model is a community-based transmission model of COVID-19
in Nigeria.
It is assumed that recovered individuals developed permanent immunity to COVID-19 since it has not
been proven that recovered individuals become susceptible again. It is based on literature [3, 8].
Infection is acquired via direct contact and inhalation or swallowing of infectious human fluid droplets.
Rodent infection is not considered due to the reality that present infections that are bedeviling the
country are a secondary infection and do not originate in Nigeria.
For an individual to become infectious, he/she must pass through the latent stage.

The schematic diagram of the transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 model is shown in Figure 1 below.

3. Basic Reproduction Number
The basic reproduction number, 𝑅0 , in an epidemiological study shows how transmissible or infectious an
infection is. It is the average number of new infections an infected person can infect in an infective period. From
the value of the reproduction number, we can predict if an infection will spread in exponential progression, die
off after some time or remain constant without any further spread. When 𝑅0 < 1, the infection will die off as
each infected will infect less than one person in the infective period. When R0 = 1, the infection becomes
endemic and stays with each infected person infecting one new person. When 𝑅0 > 1, an infection spreads and
the number of infected people will grow in an exponential proportion which will eventually lead to a pandemic
as is seen in Nigeria and most of the world now for COVID-19 cases.
The basic reproduction number is computed at the disease-free equilibrium state using the next-generation
approach by Van den Driessche and Watmough [15]. It is defined as the maximum eigenvalue of the matrix,
𝐹𝑉 −1 where matrices, 𝐹 and 𝑉 are the Jacobian matrices for new infections and the movement in or out of the
infected populations by other means respectively. This is evaluated at disease-free equilibrium state, 𝐸0 =
(𝑆(0), 0,0, 0, 0, 0, 0,0) and the infected populations are 𝐸, 𝐼, 𝐼𝑁𝑇 , 𝐼𝐽 , 𝐻. These matrices are given as

R1 means that the infected individuals in I(t) with meantime, , have contact with susceptible individuals, S(t)
f
at a rate, 𝛽 ∗ .

R 2 means that out of the infected individuals in I(t) with meantime, f , a proportion (1-p) of them miss the mass

testing at a rate, σ1 and are represented as INT (t) and spend g average time in INT (t) population. The INT (t)
population have contact with susceptible individuals, S(t) at a rate, 𝛽 ∗ .

R 3 implies that a proportion p of I(t) population with meantime, f , participate in the mass testing at a testing
1

rate, σ2 and are represented as IJ population with mean-time, h. The IJ (𝑡) population have contact with
susceptible individuals like health workers and family members at a rate, 𝛽 ∗ n1 .
R 4 contributes in two ways, the infected individuals that miss mass testing,

H(t) population and have contact with susceptible individuals, S(t) at a rate, 𝛽 ∗ n3 .
4. Numerical Simulation
Nigeria COVID-19 cases started with an imported case of a 44-year-old Italian citizen who arrived in Nigeria
on 24th February 2020. He presented himself to the staff clinic of his company in Gun state on 26th February
2020 and later confirmed as the first official case of COVID-19 in Nigeria on 27th February 2020. Cumulatively,
five cases were confirmed from 27th February 2020 to 18th March 2020. From 19th March 2020 to 7th June
2020, the Nigeria COVID-19 cases have risen to a five-digit number of 12801 cumulative cases [16]. On 22nd
March 2020, Nigeria recorded the first death of COVID-19. The first hundred days of daily confirmed cases of
Nigeria COVID-19 with their dates are displayed graphically in Figure 2 (a). The COVID-19 model of equation
(3) is fit to the first hundred days of Nigeria's cumulative cases using parameter values from the literature [3,
8]. This helps to estimate parameter values used in this work and they are presented in Table 2 with their sources.
The Nigeria cumulative cases of the first hundred days with the COVID-19 model (3) are shown in Figure 2(b).
The main focus of this work is to show how mass testing and intervention measures will help in curtailing the

intervention measures are already put in place by the Nigerian government. The sources in Table 2 and estimated

For the ease of understanding, we define intervention measures (face mask and social distancing) compliance
as follows: i. Poor compliance: < 50% ; ii. Moderate compliance: 50% ≤ 𝛼 < 70% ; iii. Strict compliance:
𝛼 ≥ 70%. Similarly, we define the testing rate as follows: i. Poor testing rate: 𝜎2 < 0.5; ii. Moderate testing
rate: 0.5 ≤ 𝜎2 < 0.7; iii. High testing rate: 𝜎2 ≥ 0.7.
Using the parameter values in Table 2, the basic reproduction number (𝑅0 ) for Nigeria is 1.916. This is obtained
when the compliance of intervention measures is moderate (𝛼 = 50%) and the testing rate is poor. (𝜎2 =
0.061). In Figure 3, the numbers in the square boxes are the basic reproduction number values which occur at
the intersection of intervention measures, 𝛼, and the testing rate, 𝜎2 . The compliance with intervention measures
is represented on the y − axis while the testing rate is on the x − axis. The basic reproduction number is greater
than unity when the compliance with intervention measures is poor (𝛼 < 50%) and the testing rate is high
(𝜎2 ≥ 0.7). However, the basic reproduction number is less than unity( 𝑅0 < 1) when the compliance with
intervention measures is moderate (50% ≤ 𝛼 < 70%) and the testing rate is also moderate (0.5 ≤ 𝜎2 < 0.7)
or when the compliance with intervention measures is strict (𝛼 = 70%) and the testing rate is poor (𝜎2 = 0.3).
This implies that Nigeria will be able to halt the spread of COVID-19 under these two conditions. It will be
easier to enforce strict compliance with intervention measures compliance in the presence of poor testing rate
caused by the limited availability of testing facilities and manpower in Nigeria. On the other hand, poor
intervention measures compliance and the high testing rate will not keep the 𝑅0 less than unity. Moderate
intervention measures and moderate testing rate will be needed for the 𝑅0 to be less than unity.
We observed in Figures 4(a) that when the compliance with intervention measures is moderate, the number of
infected individuals in the population reduces as the testing rate increases. Also, in Figure 5(a), when the testing
rate is poor (𝜎2 = 0.061), the number of infected individuals in the population reduces as the intervention
measures compliance increases.
Increasing both interventions reduces the number of infected individuals that could have died of COVID-19 in
the country (see Figure 4(b) and 5(b)). This is expected as the infected individuals who may have contacted the
virus will start treatment immediately especially the isolated asymptomatic infected individuals that have a high
probability of early treatment when they develop symptoms. Death may be averted with the early
commencement of proper treatment.
Figure 6(a) estimate the number of persons that will be infected when the intervention measures and the testing
rates are compared at different values. For instance, when the compliance with intervention measures is poor
and the testing rate is poor (𝜎2 = 0.3), 160,900 persons will be infected in the population. Similarly, when the
compliance with intervention measures is poor and the testing rate is moderate (𝜎2 = 0.5), 34,460 persons will
be infected. When the compliance with intervention measures is moderate and the testing rate is poor (𝜎2 =
0.3), 14,830 persons will also be infected. These conditions support our earlier observation that the basic
reproduction number is greater than unity when the compliance with intervention measures is poor (𝛼 < 50%)
and the testing rate is high (𝜎2 ≥ 0.7). This implies that COVID-19 will remain in the population unless there
is an additional intervention such as vaccination.
However, when the compliance with intervention measures is moderate and the testing rate is moderate, about
168 persons will be infected in the population. Also, when the compliance with intervention measures is strict
and the testing rate is poor (𝜎2 = 0.3), it will result in 151 persons being infected. Any of the two scenarios
will keep the basic reproduction number less than unity which implies that the chance of an infected person
transmitting the infection to another person is very unlikely. These will reduce the spread of COVID-19 in
Nigeria. This is similar to the finding by Okuonghae and Omame [10] who reported that the case detection rate

of 0.8 per day with 55% of social distancing will eradicate COVID-19 in Lagos State Nigeria. It is also supported
by the work of Iboi et al. [8] who reported that COVID-19 can be eliminated in Nigeria if social distancing and
face mask compliance were at least moderate. Thus we advocate that based on limited testing facilities and lack
of man-power, it will be easier to achieve strict compliance with the intervention measures even under the
existing poor testing rate in Nigeria for COVID-19 to be eradicated in the population. Furthermore, Figure 6b
showed that the number of dead persons will be reduced regardless of the various intervention measures
compliance and testing rate combinations.
6. Conclusion
In conclusion, instead of the existing focus on ramping up testing rate without a set target, we advocate that
Nigerian governments (Federal and States) should aim at achieving a testing rate of at least 0.3 per day while
ensuring that all citizens strictly comply with social distancing and wearing of face masks. The recommended
world best practices includes observing social distancing and wearing face masks.
Based on this research, it is recommended that Nigeria should target strict compliance with social distancing
and wearing of face masks, and achieving at least a testing rate of 0.3 per day. This is the most plausible option
with the potential to flatten the epidemiological curve of COVID-19 in Nigeria given the poor economic outlook
in the country.
