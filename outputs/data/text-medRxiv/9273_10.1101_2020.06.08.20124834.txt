Research in context
Evidence before this study: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) was first diagnosed in
Scotland on the 1st of March 2020 following the emergence of the causative severe acute
respiratory system coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus in China in December 2019. During
the first month of the outbreak in Scotland, 2310 positive cases of COVID-19 were detected,
associated with 1832 hospital admissions, 207 intensive care admissions and 126 deaths. The
number of introductions into Scotland and the source of those introductions was not known
prior to this study.
Added value of this study Using a combined phylogenetic and epidemiological approach
following real-time next generation sequencing of 452 SARS-CoV-2 samples, it was
estimated that the virus was introduced to Scotland on at least 113 occasions, mostly from
other European countries, including Italy, Austria and Spain. Localised outbreaks occurred in
the community across multiple Scottish health boards, within healthcare facilities and an
international conference and community transmission was established rapidly, before local
and international lockdown measures were introduced.

Abstract
SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, emerged in Wuhan, China in December
2019 and spread rapidly throughout the world. Understanding the introductions of this new
coronavirus in different settings may assist control efforts and the establishment of
frameworks to support rapid response in future infectious disease outbreaks.
We investigated the first four weeks of emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in Scotland after
the first case reported on the 1st March 2020. We obtained full genome sequences from 452
individuals with a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, representing 20% of all
cases until 1st April 2020 (n=2310). This permitted a genomic epidemiology approach to
study the introductions and spread of the SARS-2 virus in Scotland.
From combined phylogenetic and epidemiological analysis, we estimated at least 113
introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into Scotland during this period. Clusters containing multiple
sequences suggestive of onward transmission occurred in 48/86 (56%). 42/86 (51%) clusters
had no known international travel history indicating undetected introductions.
The majority of viral sequences were most closely related to those circulating in other
European countries, including Italy, Austria and Spain. Travel-associated introductions of
SARS-CoV-2 into Scotland predated travel restrictions in the UK and other European
countries. The first local transmission occurred three days after the first case. A shift from
travel-associated to sustained community transmission was apparent after only 11 days.
Undetected introductions occurred prior to the first known case of COVID-19. Earlier travel
restrictions and quarantine measures might have resulted in fewer introductions into Scotland,
thereby reducing the number of cases and the subsequent burden on health services. The high
number of introductions and transmission rates were likely to have impacted on national
contact tracing efforts. Our results also demonstrate that local real-time genomic
epidemiology can be used to monitor transmission clusters and facilitate control efforts to
restrict the spread of COVID-19.

Background
The pandemic virus severe acute respiratory system coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread
rapidly throughout the world, including Europe, following its emergence in Wuhan, China in
December 2019 (1-4). SARS-CoV-2 is a highly transmissible Betacoronavirus, related to the
first SARS virus (5). It causes the clinical syndrome coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19),
characterised by nonspecific respiratory or gastrointestinal viral symptoms and anosmia. In
severe cases, acute respiratory distress syndrome, cardiovascular disease, neurological
manifestations, thrombosis and renal failure may occur (6, 7). A rare Kawasaki-like disease
has recently been described in children (8). Despite the mobilisation of significant resources
to contain the outbreak, COVID-19 was declared a Public Health Emergency of International
Concern (PHEIC) by the World Health Organisation on 30th January 2020 and a pandemic
on 11th March 2020 (9, 10). Many countries are now responding to large outbreaks triggering
unprecedented social and economic disruption and challenges to local healthcare systems.
The WHO has declared a PHEIC on five occasions since 2009, all as a result of RNA virus
outbreaks (H1N1 influenza, Zika, polio and Ebola). Pathogen genomic sequencing is now
established as a core component of the modern epidemiological response to such outbreaks,
driven by modern nucleic acid sequencing technologies that can immediately yield entire
pathogen genomes from clinical samples (11). The integration of viral genomic data with
spatial, temporal and other metadata in a genomic epidemiology framework has allowed
enhanced inference of the origin and transmission dynamics of disease outbreaks (12-14).
Such an approach is particularly applicable to RNA viruses, as their relatively low-fidelity
replication cycle generates mutations in the viral genome at a rate observable over the rapid
time scale of an outbreak (15).
In this study, we sequenced laboratory-confirmed positive cases of COVID-19 in Scotland,
and analysed them alongside available international data, in order to estimate the number of
introduction events and early spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the country. We also aimed to
investigate outbreaks in health-care settings in real-time. During the sampling period, 2310
positive cases of COVID-19 were detected (https://statistics.gov.scot), associated with 1832
hospital admissions, 207 intensive care admissions and 126 deaths. Applying a genomic
epidemiology approach to the data, we demonstrate the outbreak is the result of multiple
separate introductions of the virus associated with international travel, and that community
transmission was quickly established in Scotland, well before the introduction of ‘lockdown’
countermeasures on the 23rd March.
Methods
Samples. Up to 300 samples per week were selected prospectively following ethical approval
from the relevant national biorepository authorities (16/WS/0207NHS and10/S1402/33)
between 1st March and 1st April 2020. 50% of samples were randomly selected to achieve a
representative target for all Scottish health boards and 50% to cover suspected healthcarerelated nosocomial infections as they occurred. Health boards with a small population size
were reported at a minimum of 5 sequences per region to avoid deductive disclosure. The
Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh and West of Scotland Specialist Virology Centre, NHSGGC
conducted diagnostic real-time RT-PCR to detect SARS-CoV-2 positive samples, following
nucleic acid extraction utilising the NucliSENS® EasyMag® and Roche MG96
platforms(16). Residual nucleic acid from 452 samples underwent whole genome next
generation sequencing at the MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research (CVR)
and the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh. Clinical details including recent travel history were

obtained from assay request forms submitted to the diagnostic laboratory and where available
electronic patient records.
Sequencing: Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) Following extraction, samples
underwent DNase treatment (AM2222) and libraries were prepared utilising protocols
developed by the ARTIC network (v1 and v2) https://artic.network/ncov-2019. 50 fmol of
library pools were loaded onto each flow cell (R9.4.1). Sequencing was conducted in
MinKNOW version 19.12.5. Raw FAST5 files were basecalled using Guppy version 3.4.5 in
high accuracy mode using a minimum quality score of 7. RAMPART v1.0.5 was used to
visualise read mapping in real-time. Reads were size filtered, demultiplexed and trimmed
with Porechop (https://github.com/rrwick/Porechop), and mapped against reference strain
Wuhan-Hu-1 (MN908947). Variants were called using Nanopolish 0.11.3 and accepted if
they had a log-likelihood score of greater than 200 and minimum read coverage of 20.
Sequencing: Illumina MiSeq. Amplicons were generated as described above. DNA
fragments were cleaned using AMPURE beads (Beckman Coulter) and 40 ng used to prepare
Illumina sequencing libraries with a DNA KAPA library preparation kit (Roche). Indexing
was carried out with NEBNext multiplex oligos (NEB), using 7 cycles of PCR. Libraries
were pooled in equimolar amounts and loaded on a MiSeqV2 cartridge (500 cycles). To
estimate sequencing error rate, seven samples were processed in duplicate from extracted
RNA with a target enrichment protocol using NimbleGen probes (Roche). Reads were
trimmed with trim_galore (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/)
and mapped with BWA (17) to the Wuhan-Hu-1 (MN908947) reference sequence, followed
by primer trimming and consensus calling with iVar (18) and a minimum read coverage of
10.
Sequence Data. Consensus sequences with >90% coverage were included. All consensus
genomes are available from the GISAID database (https://www.gisaid.org), the COG-UK
consortium website (https://www.cogconsortium.uk/data/) and BAM files from the European
Nucleotide Archive’s Sequence Read Archive service, BioProject PRJEB37886
(https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/PRJEB37886). See supplementary table 1 for IDs and
dates of sampling.
Phylogenetic analysis. Sequences from GISAID were downloaded on the 10th April and
aligned in CoV-GLUE (http://cov-glue.cvr.gla.ac.uk). Consensus sequences were aligned
using MAFFT (19). A maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree was constructed using IQTREE with the HKY nucleotide substitution model as determined by modeltest-NG (20, 21)
and visualised with Figtree. PANGOLIN (https://github.com/hCoV-2019/pangolin) was used
for assigning phylogenetic lineages with the additional step of removal of identical sequences
(22). The estimated number of introductions into Scotland was calculated by combining
lineage assignment with travel history and date of sampling to allow for multiple travelassociated introductions with identical sequences. A Scottish-specific cluster analysis was
carried out using the following rules: identical sequences from individuals residing in
Scotland were assumed to be linked unless there was a history of travel outside Scotland.
Scottish lineages were identified where a basal Scottish sequence was present. Clusters
including at least two Scottish sequences were included as evidence of onward transmission
if no travel history was present for at least one individual.

Findings
Multiple introductions of SARS-CoV-2 in Scotland. 452 SARS-CoV-2 genomes were
generated with >90% genome coverage, representing 20% of laboratory-confirmed Scottish
COVID-19 cases. The median Ct value was 28.98 (range 16-39). Of 452 individuals, 272 (60%)
reported no travel, and 61 (14%) reported travel outside Scotland. No travel history was
recorded for 119 (26%) individuals. Countries visited included Italy (n=37), Spain (n=7),
Austria (n=5), Switzerland (n=3), France (n=2), England (n=1), Ireland (n=1), Poland (n=1)
and Thailand (n=1). Three individuals returned from Caribbean cruise holidays.
The first case of COVID-19 in Scotland was a 51-year-old male from Tayside with mild
respiratory symptoms who was tested on the 28th February 2020 (and reported positive on the
1st March 2020). He had returned from Italy after attending a rugby match 9 days earlier (23).
The first confirmed case who had not travelled occurred three days later, on 2nd March 2020.
Reflecting the change from returning travellers to an older disease-susceptible demographic,
the median age of cases increased from 44 (IQR 32-51) in the first week of the epidemic to 62
(IQR 47-76) in the fourth, as infections moved from travel-associated to local community
transmission (Figure 1; p<0.001).

To determine the relationship of the viruses identified in Scotland to circulating SARS-CoV2 variants, we inferred an evolutionary tree using viruses sequenced in this study against all
complete genomes available from GISAID (Figure 2; Supplementary Figure 1). Overall
limited variability in the genome was observed in keeping with the lower evolutionary rate of

coronaviruses compared to other RNA viruses and the recent introduction of the virus into the
human population. The 452 genomes displayed an average of 3.4 nonsynonymous and 1.8
synonymous nucleotide substitutions in comparison to Wuhan-Hu-1 (Figure 3). Analysis of
sequencing error indicated that one genome out of seven re-sequenced using target
enrichment contained a single insertion error, which would not have impacted clustering in
the phylogenetic analysis. The strains introduced into Scotland are diverse with the majority
fitting within the B lineage (n= 432) and only 20 from lineage A (22) (Figure 2). Two
common amino acid replacements encoding 614D/G and 323P/L in spike and nsp12
respectively were observed. D614G has been hypothesised to be associated with increased
transmissibility(24). Similarly another Spike replacement N439K (reported by the CoVsurver
receptor binding surveillance GISAID, https://www.gisaid.org/covsurver) occurs with D614G
and is circulating in a Scottish cluster of 12 sequences.

SARS-CoV-2 genomes available from GISAID with known travel histories (A) and UK

Scottish variant assignment within recently defined lineages. The scale bar indicates
substitutions per nucleotide site.
Introductions were estimated based on both the phylogeny (22) and by travel history and date
of sampling. The phylogenetic analysis combined with the epidemiological history permitted
the identification of least 113 introductions into Scotland. Notably if identical basal
sequences and singleton sequences without a significant travel history were to be counted as
separate introductions, the phylogeny was suggestive of as many as 276 introductions into
Scotland. Given some of the latter are probably linked infections the true number in our
sample will be between these two numbers.

Many of the introductions of COVID-19 into Scotland were from known returning travellers
from Europe, mostly Italy (37 out of 113 introductions). 38/86 (44%) of inferred introduction
clusters were single cases not linked with further cases over time. Several singleton lineages
were not associated with travel, likely corresponding to undetected community transmission
clusters. 48 of the introductions resulted in clusters of at least two individuals and were
associated with transmission in varied settings (Figure 4), for example, in the Shetland
islands with travel links to Italy (Figure 4A), within a care home facility, community
transmission across central Scotland and transmission related to an international conference
event in Edinburgh at the end of February, prior to the first documented SARS-CoV-2 case in
Scotland (Figure 5). The latter demonstrates the extent to which conferences and other large
gatherings may contribute to the spread of the virus, supporting findings from similar events
in China and Singapore (25, 26).

Shift to community transmission. While early cases were most often associated with travel,
later cases were almost all associated with community transmission in Scotland. Of 113
introductions, 50 (44%) had no associated travel links, 58 (51%) were linked to travel in
Europe, three (3%) were linked to a Caribbean cruise and one was related to travel to
Thailand and Italy. Of 86 phylogenetic clusters, 44 (51%) were linked to sequences from
within the UK, outside Scotland. The first case of documented community transmission
occurred on the 2nd March 2020 and community transmission was well-established by the 11th
March (Figures 1, 4). A cluster occurring between the 12th and 24th March from Greater
Glasgow contained an index case with travel history to Spain (Figure 4D) but all subsequent
cases in the cluster did not report travel. This shift to community transmission is evident in
other example clusters: Figure 4B represents a cluster from a care home, Figure 4C represents
a large cluster which spread across the central belt between the 13th March and 1st April 2020
with no known associated travel.
We also investigated the possibility of local transmission chains in healthcare settings. A
healthcare worker (HCW) working on a COVID-19 ward became infected at the beginning of
the outbreak. To investigate the possibility of nosocomial transmission, all sequences from
patients on the ward were compared with that of the HCW. However, the HCW, CVR10,
showed evidence of infection from a virus strain distinct from other samples from the hospital
within lineage B.2.2, whilst the ward patient sequences were from lineages B.1.5(CVR76),
B.2.1(CVR07) and B.1.10(CVR79), indicating community rather than nosocomial infection
(Supplementary Figure 2). While the phylogenetic signal is low owing to the low levels of
variation in SARS-CoV-2 genome, this analysis demonstrates it is possible to exclude
transmission events with high certainty. Such information is useful in complex settings such
as health and care facilities where a case might indicate infection acquired elsewhere or a
breakdown in control measures.

Interpretation
Our study indicates that SARS-CoV-2 entered the Scottish population through at least 113
separate travel-related introductions, leading to at least 48 clusters of sustained community
transmission and 38 singleton sequences with no evidence of onward transmission. 44/86
(49%) of phylogenetic clusters included sequences from individuals with a known history of
international travel. The majority returned to Scotland from Europe at the end of February
and early March following travel to Italy and less commonly to Spain, Austria, Switzerland,
France, England, Ireland, Poland, the Caribbean and Thailand.
Travel to continental Europe in February and March 2020, the epicentre of the global
COVID-19 pandemic, was a clear driver of the Scottish outbreak; the majority of the lineages
detected in this study were related to European sequences. Cases with direct links to SouthEast Asia were rare. 20 lineage A sequences, a lineage present in China at the beginning of
the outbreak (but which is now globally distributed) appear to have been introduced to
Scotland via Spain. On the 28th January, the UK government recommended against all but
essential travel to China and for returning travellers to self-isolate for two weeks upon their
return regardless of symptoms (27). However, despite evidence of local transmission in Italy
as early as February 21st, advice from the Scottish Government for returning travellers from
Italy to self-isolate was issued only on the 25th of February and was limited to those having
returned from specific lockdown areas (28-30). By the time this advice was extended to all
travellers on 10th March, the COVID-19 outbreak within Scotland was already being driven
by community transmission. A lack of robust measures to manage ingress of infected
travellers from emerging pandemic hotspots may have accelerated the course of the outbreak
in Scotland and the UK as a whole.
Our data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 was introduced to Scotland on multiple occasions,
including at an international conference held in Edinburgh several days before the first
Scottish case was confirmed. Whilst multiple local cases are linked to this event, the last case
within the cluster in the UK occurred on the 27th March, suggesting that the local public
health response to this event may have been effective and did not account for the majority of
cases in Scotland. However, the geographical distribution of other sequences is striking,
spanning four continents and ten countries. The role of this event in dispersing the virus
locally and internationally, before a single case had been identified in Scotland, demonstrates
that governments should be wary of prematurely relaxing restrictions on large gatherings and
international travel.
Importantly, we identified viral lineages with no epidemiological link to travel as early as two
days after the first detection of infection, indicating earlier introduction to Scotland than the
first detected case, reported on the 1st March 2020 (23). 42/86 (49%) clusters were linked to
sequences within the UK but outside Scotland. The majority of individuals had no recorded
link to travel by the 12th March, only 2 days after substantial travel and physical distancing
restrictions were put in place. Importantly these data are suggestive of introductions and
community spread before initial detection. The epidemic in the UK expanded rapidly,
prompting the government to respond with restrictive public health measures or “lockdown”
to disrupt transmission. As the number of cases subside, this phylogenetic data will provide a
baseline for granular real-time sequencing of infections. This will be used as a measure of the
success of current measures and has the potential to contribute to decision-making around the
easing (or tightening) of public health measures.

Integration of genomic sequence data with traditional case-finding and contact tracing has the
potential to enhance descriptive epidemiology and deliver more targeted control measures.
However previous interventions of this type have been largely retrospective. The challenge
will be to develop a framework where phylogenetic information is delivered in real-time in an
easily actionable format to public health and infection control teams.
This study has some limitations. We sampled only 20% of those detected during the initial
outbreak, therefore some introduction events will have been missed. Further, public health
records were not accessed to record linkage with sequence data. While introduction of
erroneous variation during sequencing or genome assembly is possible, we estimated
experimentally that such rates were extremely low and should not affect clustering patterns in
phylogenetic analyses. This analysis, based on the available phylogeny, is most likely to be
an under-estimate, despite dense sampling of the beginning of the outbreak.
Linkage of sequences do not categorically prove that transmission events have occurred and
require correlation with epidemiological information. Many events may be linked to an
identical sequence because SARS-CoV-2 is a slowly evolving RNA virus. Exclusion of
linkage may be inferred with more certainty. As the variation present in the global diversity is
well-represented in Scotland, reflecting a high number of near simultaneous introductions,
tracking of the outbreak is feasible and can be used to refine public health interventions. Our
analysis may also have been affected by a shift in sampling all symptomatic individuals to
hospitalised patients only during mid-March. Some travel-related introductions may therefore
not have been detected (as evidenced by several clusters with no evidence of travel related
infection after this time).
The utility of genomic epidemiology to inform local level policy is highlighted by the case of
a healthcare worker in this study who tested positive for COVID-19 whilst working on a
high-risk ward. The sequence from the healthcare worker was clearly distinct from those
from the patients on the ward (Supplementary figure 2), suggesting that nosocomial
transmission was unlikely. Such information can inform targeted infection control
interventions such as the effectiveness of personal protective equipment (PPE). In contrast,
several healthcare associated clusters were detected later in the outbreak that included
healthcare workers.
In summary, the first month of the COVID-19 outbreak in Scotland was associated with
multiple introductions related to returning travellers from Europe, increased evidence of
ongoing non-travel related transmissions as time passed, and clusters related to events and
healthcare facilities. Since the onset of lockdown interventions, introductions into the
community have subsided. An earlier lockdown from countries with a high burden of cases
such as Italy and other measures such as quarantine of travellers from high-risk areas might
have prevented escalation of the outbreak and multiple clusters of ongoing community
transmission.
