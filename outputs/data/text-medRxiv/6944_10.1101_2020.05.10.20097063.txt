COVID-19 infection has created a panic across the globe in recent times. Early detection of COVID19 infection can save many lives in the prevailing situation. This virus affects the respiratory system
of a person and creates white patchy shadows in the lungs. Deep learning is one of the most effective
Artificial Intelligence techniques to analyse chest X-ray images for efficient and reliable COVID-19
screening. In this paper, we have proposed a Deep Convolutional Neural Network method for fast
and dependable identification of COVID-19 infection cases from the patient chest X-ray images. To
validate the performance of the proposed system, chest X-ray images of more than 150 confirmed
COVID-19 patients from the Kaggle data repository are used in the experimentation. The results
show that the proposed system identifies the cases with an accuracy of 93%.

1. Introduction
The COVID-19 commonly known as the novel coronavirus has become a pandemic disease causing a total of
2,01,502 deaths till 26𝑡ℎ April 2020 [16]. Since the first reporting in the Wuhan city of China in December 2019, it
has spread to most of the countries of the world. Subsequently, the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared
this ongoing outbreak as a global public health emergency
[1]. The total number of confirmed and fatal COVID-19
cases in some of the highly affected countries are shown in
Fig. 1. COVID-19 mainly affects the respiratory system of
human and damages the alveoli of lungs. Although COVID19 infection cases are mild in general, it causes severe disease with 2% fatality rate [17].
This COVID-19 virus transmits from person to person
and creates pneumonia in the human body. The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 infection includes respiratory tract illness, severe viral pneumonia with respiratory failure [18].
F. Zhou et al. [18] made a survey of 813 adult patients who
were hospitalised in Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital and found
that most of the patients who died were male. Different diseases were present in nearly half of the cases, hypertension
being the most common, followed by coronary heart disease
and diabetes. The regular symptoms on hospital admission
were cough and high fever, followed by sputum production
and fatigue. In a serious situation, the infection can cause
pneumonia, multi-organ failure, and even death [8].
The infection of COVID-19 virus can easily be identified
by using the X-ray of chest. A chest X-ray shows multiple white patchy shadows in both the lungs of a COVID-19
affected person [17]. Artificial Intelligence (AI) with image processing could be an efficient and accurate technique
to differentiate this normal and affected chest X-ray images

with good accuracy. It has the potential to improve the speed
of COVID-19 case identification and reduce its spread particularly in resource-constraint environments where expert
radiologist and high-end medical equipment are not available for early diagnosis and management of patients [10].
Deep Convolutional Neural Network is an important AI
tool which is used for detection of diseases from the medical
images ([7], [9], [11]). Lopes et al. [7] identified tuberculosis from chest X-ray images using the CNN technique with
an accuracy of more than 92%. Sergio et al. [9] and Saman
et al. [11] detected Alzheimer and Brain tumor from MRI
images using the same technique. Similarly, Ali et al. [8]
and Linda et al. [15] developed a ResNet architecture and a
CNN architecture respectively to detect COVID-19 infection
from 76 and 50 confirmed chest X-ray images respectively.
In both of these experiments, they directly applied the feature extraction and classification processes to the raw images
without any segmentation and removal of the artifacts. How-

ever both of these steps are very important to reduce the false
COVID-19 alarm. Nevertheless, all these contributions provide motivation to use AI techniques in identifying diseases
accurately with lesser time and without any human expert
intervention.
In this research, we have used CNN to identify the presence of COVID-19 infection from the chest X-ray image of a
patient. To improve the accuracy level further, we have used
a Gaussian filter to reduce the artifact, and a segmentation
technique based on the gray level thresholding to extract the
important portion from the X-ray images. To conduct the
experiment, we have used a chest X-ray image dataset collected from Kaggle [6]. Performance of the proposed system
is measured and compared with some relevant schemes in
terms of accuracy, false positives, and false negatives. Our
proposed scheme is seen to outperform those in all the aspects.

In this research, we have used two different datasets: one
for statistical analysis of symptoms [13] and the other for
chest X-ray identification [6]. Both the datasets are collected
from the Kaggle data repository. The first dataset was generated by John Hopkins University [14] which collected the
daily information from the COVID-19 affected cases, deaths
and recovery statistics of Wuhan City. This dataset contains
more than 14000 patients information with 44 different attributes including age, gender, date of onset, date of confirmation, travel history, symptoms, chronic diseases, etc. The
second dataset contains chest X-ray images along with clinical symptoms of more than 150 different COVID-19 patients
collected from Wuhan city.

3. Analysis of COVID-19 clinical symptoms
The initial symptoms of COVID-19 includes fever, cough,
dyspnea, myalgia or fatigue, headache, sputum production,
diarrhea, hemoptysis, etc. [5]. To explore the prominent
symptoms associated with this disease, we have analysed an
COVID-19 dataset collected from kaggle. Detail description of the dataset is available in the Section 2. The analysis
revealed that 12% of the total patients died with an average
age of 65.4 years. In that dataset, 59% of the total COVID19 patients were male and the remaining 41% were female.
Fever and cough were the most prominent characteristics of
COVID-19 patients being available with 95% and 71% cases
respectively. It was also observed that 95% of patients who
died had fever whereas 80% had pneumonia. As shown in
Table. 2, the average time from illness onset to hospital admission was high in case of death patient compared to discharged patient.

In addition to these clinical symptoms, COVID-19 also
shows its effect on lungs. A detail comparison of normal and
COVID-19 patient lungs has been shown in Fig. 2. It clearly
shows the white patchy ground-glass shadows present in the
lungs of COVID-19 patient. H. Chen et al. [1] performed a
study on lungs of nine different corona patients. They collected the different Chest X-ray and CT scan images from
these patients. The study found that out of nine, eight patients had white patchy ground glass shadow in lungs.

4. The Proposed Method
The automatic COVID-19 detection based on the chest
X-ray image is a complicated image identification problem
due to varying image quality across equipments used and
patients. As shown in Fig. 3, the typical workflow of our
proposed system mainly consists of five major steps: i) data
acquisition, ii) pre-processing, iii) segmentation, iv) feature
extraction, and v) classification model. These steps are explained in the following subsections.

value and second image is the filtered image with 10dB SNR
value.

5. Here, set A and set B show normal lungs and COVID19 lungs respectively. It can clearly be observed that the
COVID-19 lungs has less white pixels compared to normal
one. Mathematically the gray level thresholding can be expressed as shown in the following equation.
{
1, if 𝐼(𝑥, 𝑦) >= 𝑇
𝑅(𝑥, 𝑦) =
0, otherwise

4.1. Data Acquisition
To carry out the experiment, we have collected the chest
X-ray image dataset from kaggle. This dataset was generated
from the admitted patients in designated hospitals located in
Wuhan city of China from Dec 16, 2019 to Jan 2, 2020.

4.2. Pre-processing
Pre-processing is an essential step in classification process to improve the system accuracy. In pre-processing, we
have removed the noise present in the images. In medical images, Gaussian noise is common due to thermal fluctuations
of electronic components [4]. In X-ray images, the amount
of noise present is dependent on the sensitivity of the receptor [3]. In order to reduce this noise, we have used the 2D
Gaussian filter. A 2D Gaussian filter can be mathematically
expressed as follows:
𝐺(𝑥, 𝑦) =

1
√
𝑒𝑥𝑝(−(𝑥2
2𝜋𝛿

Here, I(x, y) and R(x, y) are the input image and resulting image pixels respectively and T is the threshold value.
Proper threshold selection is an important task in thresholdbased segmentation techniques to improve segmentation efficiency. Various researchers use the histogram of an image
to determine the threshold value based on the pixel value
with minimum frequency [12]. Histogram of chest X-ray image is shown in Fig. 6, where image A and B are of normal
and COVID-19 affected X-ray images respectively. From
this figure it can be observed that the pixel value with minimum frequency lies between 25 to 30 for both the images.
Hence we have set the threshold value as 30.

+ 𝑦2 )∕2𝛿 2 )

Here, 𝛿 2 is the variance and size of the filter kernal 𝑙 (−𝑙 <=
𝑥, 𝑦 <= 𝑙) [2]. By applying this filter, the Signal to Noise
Ratio (SNR) of the images have been enhanced. In Fig. 4,
we have shown the filtered and original X-ray images with
10dB and 4dB SNR values respectively.

4.4. Feature Extraction
A multi-layer CNN architecture is developed to extract
the important features from the X-ray images for automatic
identification of COVID-19 infection which is shown in Fig.
7. Convolution layer produces some high-level complex features which are reduced by the pooling layers. In this progressive manner, CNN can learn hierarchical features layer
by layer automatically. The developed CNN architecture consists of four convolutional layers, four maxpooling layers and
we have used ReLU activation function. During convolution
we have used a kernal size of 3𝑥3 and 0 stride size during
pooling. After final convolution and maxpooling we have
finally received 22 features value as output.

4.3. Segmentation
Segmentation is the method of dividing an image into
some sections with related properties such as gray level, color,
brightness, and contrast. Proper segmentation of medical
images is an essential step in disease identification by identifying the region of interest, locating the tumor, measuring
the tissue volume, etc. In this research, we have segmented
the chest X-ray images based on the gray level thresholding as the lungs of a COVID-19 patient contains many white
patches. All the gray regions are separated from others by
converting gray pixels into white pixels and remaining into
black pixels. In this way, one can easily differentiate the normal and abnormal chest X-ray images. Segmentation of normal and COVID-19 patient lungs images are shown in Fig.

4.5. Classification Model
The fully connected layer is an essential component of
CNN; it helps in the classification of an object. It takes input
from the output of the previous layer i.e., from the last feature

In this research to identify the presence of Covid-19 infection, we have used chest x-ray images. The identification
process is based on the presence of a white patchy shadow
in the lungs. For proper detection, we have pre-processed
all the images by segmenting the important lungs section
from the others. Before segmentation, we have cleared all
the artifacts using the Gaussian filter. In this experiment, a
threshold-based segmentation is done to separate gray pixels from the others. During the segmentation, we have set
the threshold value into 30. In noise removal step, the image
quality has increased from SNR 4 dB to 10 dB. The output
of segmentation has shown in Fig. 5, where we have clearly
separated the gray pixels from the white pixels. From the
segmentation results, it is also clear that the number of gray
pixels in Covid-19 affected lungs is very less compared to the
normal lungs. After segmentation, features were extracted
from the segmented images using the above mentioned CNN
architecture and finally all the extracted features were fed
into the softmax classifier for the detection. During the experiment, the dataset was divided into two parts where 80%
was kept for training and the remaining 20% was used for
testing. The experimental results of our proposed system
during training and testing has shown in Table. 4. To analyse the performance of our proposed system, we have used
a confusion matrix as shown in Fig. 9. It measures three
different parameters: accuracy, false positive, and false negative using the equations 1, 2, and 3 respectively.

extraction layer. The flatten layer turns the feature matrix
into a single vector and passes it to the first fully connected
layer. These feature values are multiplied by weight vectors and passed to the softmax activation function just like
a traditional artificial neural network. To learn the feature
more accurately and to reduce the error, weights of the fully
connected layers are updated by using the back-propagation
algorithm. The neuron of the output layer gives the classification level of each input image. In our classification model,
there are two fully connected layers and one softmax activation layer. Each fully connected layer has 128 numbers of

During training, we have achieved 100%, 0%, and 0% accuracy, false positive, and false negative respectively. But,
during testing, we have achieved 93%, 4%, and 3% in accuracy, false positive, and false negative respectively. The
comparison of our proposed method with existing COVIDNet [15] and DCNN [8] is presented in the form of a bar
graph which is shown in Fig. 8. From the result it is apparent that our DEEP-CNN based proposed system is able to detect the presence of COVID-19 with 93% accuracy with very
less false positive and false negative rates. In this experiment
both COVID-Net & DCNN has achieved a very less acuuracy compared to proposed method since they have directly
applied the classification without performing any noise removal and segmentation. The experimental results proves
the essence of the proposed method by outperforming the
other two.

within a short time. The proposed system could not be tested
in extensive environment as very limited number of COVID19 X-ray images are available till date. Even though CT scan
images might have yielded more accuracy, such experiments
could not be conducted as COVID-19 CT scan image dataset
is not yet available publicly.
