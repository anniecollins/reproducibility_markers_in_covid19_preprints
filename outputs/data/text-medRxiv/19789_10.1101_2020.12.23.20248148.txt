ABSTRACT
HLA haplotypes were found to be associated with increased risk for viral infections or disease
severity in various diseases, including SARS. Several genetic variants are associated with
Covid-19 severity. However, no clear association between HLA and Covid-19 incidence or
severity has been reported. We conducted a large scale HLA analysis of Israeli individuals who
tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection by PCR. Overall, 72,912 individuals with known HLA
haplotypes were included in the study, of whom 6,413 (8.8%) were found to have SARS-CoV-2
by PCR. a Total of 20,937 subjects were of Ashkenazi origin (at least 2/4 grandparents). One
hundred eighty-one patients (2.8% of the infected) were hospitalized due to the disease. None
of the 66 most common HLA loci (within the five HLA subgroups; A, B, C, DQB1, DRB1) was
found to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection or hospitalization. Similarly, no association

was detected in the Ashkenazi Jewish subset. Moreover, no association was found between
heterozygosity in any of the HLA loci and either infection or hospitalization.
We conclude that HLA haplotypes are not a major risk/protecting factor among the Israeli

MAIN TEXT
The Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules are cell surface protein complexes
encoded in the Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLA) locus. The HLA locus is highly polymorphic
with thousands of different alleles and millions of haplotypes reported1,2. HLAs are associated
with several infectious diseases. Previous disease association studies showed that some HLA
haplotypes are highly correlated with multiple viral infections3,4,5 and have been reported to
confer differential susceptibility to infection and the severity of the resulting disease6. In
particular, HLA class I alleles are key players in the immune defense against viruses as they
initiate the activity of T cells against the invading intracellular pathogens

7,8

. Although

presentation of viral antigens relies classically on MHC class I molecules, MHC class II genes
have also been associated with the outcome of many viral infections9,10,11. Studies in a range of
species12,13,14,15, including humans16,17, imply a heterozygous selection mechanism operating on
the HLA loci as an explanation for the extensive variability of the MHC molecules18,19. However,
recent results on human populations suggest that such an advantage may be limited20.
In the context of Covid-19, specific HLAs have been associated with coronaviruses in the past,
including SARS coronavirus infections21,22. Several efforts were made to identify HLA-related
susceptibility to SARS-CoV-1 after the first SARS epidemic in East Asia23,24,25,26 and the MERSCoV outbreak in 2014 in Saudi Arabia27. Most of these case studies provided weak or conflicting
results and required further validation due to the relatively small sample size. An association
between the geographic distributions of Covid-19 and HLA alleles has been suggested28.
Similarly, an association between severe disease outcome and specific HLAs was suggested by
another small-scale whole-genome sequencing study29. In silico model raised the possibility that
HLA supertypes may have a role in the severity of the disease30. Moreover, a reduced
expression of human leukocyte antigen class DR (HLA-DR) was detected in peripheral blood
mononuclear cells of Covid-19 patients31. Nevertheless, genome-wide association study

(GWAS) among 1980 Italian and Spanish patients with severe Covid-19 detected a few loci
associated with that state but no association with the HLA loci at chromosome 6 or heterozygote
advantage was found32. However another GWAS study analyzing 2244 critically-ill Covid-19
patients in the UK detected an association between HLA-G and HLA-DPB1 and Covid-1933.
Two other large unpublished GWAS studies did not report a signal at the HLA locus on
chromosome 634,35. To the best of our knowledge there are no previous studies looking
specifically at HLA subgroups among individuals with Covid-19.

HLA allele and haplotype frequencies differ between populations belonging to different ethnic
groups36,37. For example, among Jewish populations, similarities of HLA alleles may be seen
within ethnicities, allowing an estimation of an individual's origin based on his HLA genotypes38.
It has been estimated that decreased HLA variability may assist to detect signals relevant to a
specific disease state. Indeed, specific HLAs were associated with different disorders in the
Ashkenazi population, a large genetically isolated group39,40,41. Given the diversity of HLAs
among populations, testing genetically isolated and genetically homogenous populations may
provide an advantage in detecting the effects of specific genetic variants, in particular in
Ashkenazi Jews.

Our study aimed to utilize the presence of a large-scale cohort having HLA genotypes and a
high rate of Covid-19 to test the possible role of specific HLA alleles in SARS-CoV-2 infection
and its severity. Using a data set of this magnitude also allowed us to analyze associations
between Covid-19 infection and HLA zygosity. Understanding how variation in HLA may affect
both susceptibility and severity of Covid-19 infection could help to identify and stratify individuals
at higher risk for the disease and may support future vaccination strategies.

A case-control study with a test-negative design42 was used to evaluate the infection outcome,
while a retrospective cohort study was used to evaluate the hospitalization outcome. In the
case-control design, patients tested positive or negative for SARS-CoV-2 were evaluated for
their HLA alleles. In the cohort design, patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 were
followed-up to see who were hospitalized.
The study was based on patient data taken from the data warehouse of Clalit Health Care
(CHS), a large integrated payer-provider healthcare organization operating in Israel. CHS
insures over 4.6 million Israelis (~50%), which are a representative sample of the entire
population.

HLA alleles were obtained from the Ezer Mizion Bone Marrow Donor Registry, which enlists the
highest number of registered unrelated volunteer donors per capita in the world. The HLA
resolution varies from serologic to DNA-based testing at low, intermediate, and allele
resolution43. The initial analysis included HLA genotypes of 1,040,250 donors which represent
all the populations composing the Ezer Mizion registry. High-resolution five-locus typing was
imputed for all donors using GRIMM (GRaph IMputation and Matching for HLA Genotypes)44,
which produces the most likely five-locus genotype consistent with the low-resolution typing and
the self-defined ethnicity. For each subject in the dataset, we chose the unphased genotype
with the highest probability. We also used the low resolution two-digit typing of each subject, as
well as the homozygosity status of each allele.

The study included all patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR that were members of CHS at
the date of testing and had HLA data available. Cases were those patients tested positive, while
controls were patients tested negative. Covariates for adjustment included age, sex, number of
children in the household, population sector (ultra-orthodox vs. general, which has had an
important impact on the epidemic in Israel), socioeconomic status, and ethnic origin (Ashkenazi

vs. other). These covariates were extracted as of the test date. The number of children in the
household was calculated based on CHS' demographic registry. The population sector was
determined using the patient's primary-care clinic address. Socioeconomic status was
determined based on a patient's home address. Patients were defined as Ashkenazi if they
were Jewish and were born themselves or had at least one parent or 2 grandparents born in
central or western Europe. A severe disease course was defined by hospitalization less than 2
weeks after the molecular diagnosis.
The association between each HLA allele and the outcome, adjusted for the covariates listed
above, was tested separately for each allele using logistic regression. Homozygosity was tested
similarly, as a binary predictor, separately for each locus. Bonferroni correction was applied to
the p-values and confidence intervals. The results were similar when the Benjamini-Hochberg
false discovery rate was controlled45. Zygosity was computed based on two-digit HLA alleles at
the appropriate locus. The study was performed with the approval of the Institutional Research
Community (IRB) #0080-20-COM2).
Overall, 72,912 individuals with HLA genotyping and at least one PCR test for Covid-19 were
included in the study between March 1st, 2020 and October 31th 2020. Of them, 8.8% (6,413)
tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR. Demographic and socioeconomic data related to the
population is available in Table 1.
All HLA alleles were grouped by two-digit representations to minimize the number of tests, and
only alleles with a frequency of at least 1 % were used. A total of 16 HLA-A, 20 HLA-B, 13 HLAC, 5 HLA-DQB1, and 12 HLA-DRB1 (Table 2) met the criteria for analysis. No significant
differences in HLA- allele frequency were detected between individuals with negative and
positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR (Figure 1 Left panel).

We further tested whether HLA genotypes may be associated with severe Covid-19 infection. Of
the 6,413 infected individuals, 181 (2.6%) were hospitalized within 2 weeks. Again, no
significant HLA genotypes were found to be associated with hospitalization among individuals
positive for SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 1 Right panel).
Given the association between HLA and ethnic origin and the fact that the Ashkenazi Jewish
population is genetically isolated35, we tested for SARS-CoV-2 presence and severity within the
Ashkenazi population. This analysis included 20,937 Ashkenazi donors, of which 1,495 were
positive for SARS-CoV-2, and 45 were hospitalized. No significant association was observed
between either SARS-CoV-2 positive frequency (Figure 2 Left panel) or Covid-19 severity
(Figure 2 Right panel) and any HLA subgroup in the Ashkenazi population (Figure 2).
To investigate whether HLA heterozygosity is associated with the outcome of SARS-CoV-2
infection we further tested whether an increased probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection or severe
disease course are associated with a higher homozygous rate of each of the 5 HLA loci
subgroup. No such association was detected either in the general population or in the
Ashkenazi population (Figure 3).
The Covid-19 pandemic is associated with heavy medical, economic, and social costs. A few
factors were associated with decreased or increased risks of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including
smoking46 and gender (male)47. Genetic factors were also found to be associated with Covid-19
disease severity 48, including a genomic segment of around 50 kilobases in size that is inherited
from Neanderthals49. Similarly, a meta-analysis of GWAS studies of patients from Spain and
Italy with severe Covid-19, which was defined as a hospitalization with respiratory failure,
detected three significant loci with odd ratios of 1.32-1.77 per loci32. Given the important role of
HLA in several viral infections, the above study analyzed the extended HLA region

(chromosome 6, 25 through 34 Mb) but did not find significant SNP association signals at the
HLA complex.
Our study, performed on a large scale dataset, did not detect any specific HLA subgroups
associated with increased or decreased risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection, or a severe disease
course causing hospitalization. We also did not detect any associations of heterozygote
advantage with Covid-19 when we analyzed the entire study population or when analyzing a
sub-population. In contrast with GWAS studies, in which a very large number of loci are
compared and thus increasing the multiple testing burden, we incorporated HLA alleles with a
prevalence of >1% in the Israeli population. Ths approach enabled a large-scale analysis not of
a few HLA subtypes but of f 66 variants.
Two main caveats should be considered. First, the imputation of HLA alleles may induce errors.
However, the precision of the imputation was previously established50. Moreover, no association
was found with the A alleles that were typed in the vast majority of subjects. Finally, the analysis
was performed at the two-digit level, which is practically unaffected by imputation. Another
possible limitation is the age distribution. Our study included only a small proportion of
hospitalized cases 181/6,413 (2.6%). This may be related to the average young age of
individuals for whom we have HLA data. However, this should not affect the results related to
SARS-CoV-2 infection. While hospitalization alone may not be an indicator of disease severity,
we expect a significant enrichment of severe cases in hospitalized patients.
The lack of HLA association reported here and in previous smaller studies, and the absence of
advantage for heterozygote may suggest that heterozygote advantage in HLA may be more
limited in general than often considered. This is in agreement with more recent claims that other
mechanisms beyond heterozygote advantage or pathogen-driven balancing selection may be
the source of the large HLA polymorphism2,20.

We did not detect an HLA association with the initial phases of infection and hospitalization. As
in other diseases, the initial response to the disease in the first few days is mainly mediated by
the innate immune response, limiting the involvement of HLA and T Cells. HLA may still be
involved in the later phases of the disease progression, such as long term sequels, or
complications following hospitalization. A long-term follow-up will be needed to test for those.

Figure Titles and Legends
Figure 1: Odds Ratio (OR) as a function of HLA allele. In all figures, the dot represents the
odds ratio, and the interval represents the 95% confidence intervals (Bonferroni correction). The
left plot is for SARS-CoV-2 infection and the right plot is for hospitalization. We trim error bars at
3 for better visualization. The analysis presented here is for the full population. One can see that
no HLA allele is significantly associated.

Figure 2: Odds Ratio (OR) as a function of HLA allele in the Ashkenazi population. In all
figures, the dot represents the odds ratio, and the interval represents the 95% confidence
intervals (Bonferroni correction). The left plot is for SARS-CoV-2 infection and the right plot is for
hospitalization. We trim error bars at 3 for better visualization. The analysis presented here is for
the Ashkenazi population. One can see that no HLA allele is significantly associated

Figure 3: Effect of homozygosity on either infection or hospitalization in the entire
studied population or the Ashkenazi population. Again no significant association was found.
Homozygosity at a given locus is defined as having the same low-resolution allele in this locus.
