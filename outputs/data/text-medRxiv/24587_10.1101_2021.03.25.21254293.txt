Abstract (100 words)
Patients with lasting symptoms of COVID-19 should be offered a comprehensive recovery
programme. Patients that completed a six week, twice supervised adapted pulmonary rehabilitation
programme demonstrated statistically significant improvements in exercise capacity, respiratory
symptoms, fatigue and cognition. Participants improved by 112m on the Incremental Shuttle
Walking Test and 544 seconds on the Endurance Shuttle Walking Test. There were no serious
adverse events recorded, and there were no dropouts related to symptom worsening. COVID-19
rehabilitation appears feasible and significantly improves clinical outcomes.
Introduction
COVID-19 can lead to a number of lasting symptoms such as breathlessness, fatigue and reduced
ability to engage in activities of daily living1. It became apparent that a recovery or rehabilitation
programme would be necessary to support those to return to normal following infection. The
European Respiratory Society taskforce identified a need for a formal assessment to understand
physical and emotional functioning to determine rehabilitation needs following COVID-19 infection2.
This statement identifies the need for a rehabilitative intervention following hospital discharge and
includes a comprehensive programme. It has been acknowledged that a unidimensional programme
will not meet the needs of COVID-19 survivors who will present with a variety of different
symptoms3. However, there is invariably some overlap between the needs of COVID-19 survivors
and a Pulmonary Rehabilitation (PR) population. PR is a highly evidenced based intervention and
addresses many symptoms reported in the post COVID population, but it will likely need
modifications. Therefore this model was adapted when developing COVID-19 rehabilitation to meet
the complex needs of these patients2. This study presents the results of the initial COVID-19
rehabilitation programme using a modified PR programme.
Methods
This study reports the experiences of the first 32 patients that completed rehabilitation following
COVID-19 infection. This observational study was approved by the National Health Service Research
Ethics Committee (reference 17/EM/0156) and registered through the ISRCTN (ISRCTN45695543).
Patients
were referred through a discharge follow up pathway; at COVID-19 medical follow up or; a

referral from their GP. Patients were included if they self-identified rehabilitation needs, and were
excluded if they demonstrated acute symptoms or were not medically stable. Patients that had
COVID-19 but managed in the community were eligible for the programme and were referred by
their GP. All patients were screened for unexplained symptoms and unstable cardiovascular disease.
The rehabilitation programme was six weeks in duration, with two supervised sessions per week.
The programme comprised of aerobic exercise (walking/treadmill based), strength training of upper
and lower limbs and educational discussions with handouts from the www.yourcovidrecovery.nhs.uk
website. The Borg breathlessness scale and rate of perceived exertion were used alongside selfreported symptoms to determine progression of the exercises. The outcomes were: the incremental
and endurance shuttle walking test (ISWT/ESWT), COPD Assessment Test (CAT)4, Functional
Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue Scale (FACIT), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale
(HADS), EuroQual 5 domains (EQ5D) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). The ISWT and
ESWT were completed in line with gold standards on a 10m course and performed a familiarisation
test at baseline5.
Data was analysed using SPSS v25. Patients were considered completers if they attended eight out of
12 scheduled sessions. A paired t-test was used to compare changes before and after rehabilitation.
Results
30 patients completed the COVID-19 rehabilitation programme (52% male, mean [SD] age 58[16]
years, length of stay 10[14] days ). 5(14%) patients required mechanical ventilation during their
admission and were managed in an ITU setting. The mean[SD] time from confirmed infection to
enrolment onto the programme was 125[54] days. The mean [SD] number of sessions completed
was 11[2] out of a scheduled 12 sessions. 30 patients completed at least eight sessions of
rehabilitation, with 2 drop outs due to social circumstances.
Baseline scores identified reduced exercise capacity and health related quality of life but relatively
well preserved anxiety, depression and cognition as measured by the HADS and MoCA respectively.
Patients that completed rehabilitation had a mean [SD] improvement in the ISWT of 112[105]m
(p<0.01), and 544[377] seconds (p<0.01). The FACIT improved by 5[7] points (p<0.01), the EQ5D
thermometer improved by 8[19] (p=0.05) and MoCA by 2[2] points (p<0.01) The CAT score improved
by a score of 3[6] (p<0.05). The HADS anxiety and depression scores improved by 0[4] and 1[4]
respectively which was not statistically significant, however the baseline scores were low (table 1).
Figure 1 demonstrates the changes in FACIT and ISWT.

Discussion
This adapted rehabilitation programme for patients following COVID-19 has demonstrated feasibility
and promising improvements in clinical outcomes. There was a high completion rate of COVID
rehabilitation in the first 32 patients as demonstrated by this study, with no dropouts attributed to a
worsening of symptoms, indicating acceptability to the participants of the intervention. There were
significant improvements in clinical outcomes of walking capacity and symptoms of fatigue,
cognition and respiratory symptoms (measured by the CAT). Whilst there are no known minimal
important differences for these outcomes in patients with COVID-19; the ISWT, ESWT, CAT, FACIT
and, MoCA all exceed the known minimal important differences in patients undergoing conventional
pulmonary rehabilitation, or with a chronic respiratory condition. It is possible that there is some
natural recovery in this cohort of patients, however, as the mean length of time between infection
and enrolment onto the programme was 125 days it is likely that natural recovery had slowed down.
There has been concern that rehabilitation may worsen or trigger symptoms of post-viral fatigue and
that exercise therapy may exacerbate fatigue. The exercise element of this programme is progressed
(by staff experienced in delivering pulmonary and cardiac rehabilitation programmes) in line with
patient’s symptoms throughout the programme and provides a holistic and pragmatic approach to
exercise therapy. The educational component of the programme supports management techniques
useful for these symptoms (such as pacing and prioritising). There were no serious adverse events
during the course of the programme supporting the safety of this intervention. The majority of
patients improved both the symptom of fatigue and exercise capacity. One patient did not improve
either fatigue or exercise capacity (due to a previous stroke). The remainder (n= 4) who reported an
increase in fatigue recorded meaningful improvements in their exercise capacity.COVID-19
Rehabilitation programmes should aim to provide a holistic and multi-faceted approach to managing
post-COVID symptoms. Clinicians should aim to individualise programmes and to monitor adverse
events and symptoms, given the limited evidence in the field.
To conclude, an adapted pulmonary rehabilitation programme to support patients with lasting
symptoms of COVID-19 is safe and demonstrates improvements in exercise capacity and symptoms
of breathlessness, fatigue and cognition.
