Assessing the plausibility of subcritical transmission of 2019-nCoV in the United States

Abstract: The 2019-nCoV outbreak has raised concern of global spread. While
person-to-person transmission within the Wuhan district has led to a large
outbreak, the transmission potential outside of the region remains unclear. Here
we present a simple approach for determining whether the upper limit of the
confidence interval for the reproduction number exceeds one for transmission in
the United States, which would allow endemic transmission. As of February 7,
2020, the number of cases in the United states support subcritical transmission,
rather than ongoing transmission. However, this conclusion can change if
pre-symptomatic cases resulting from human-to-human transmission have not
yet been identified.
The 2019-nCoV outbreak is a global health risk, especially considering the number of patients
who have already died after becoming infected in Wuhan, China. Many initial characterizations
of the virus have focused on the basic reproduction number, ​R​, which reflects the average
number of infections that each new infection causes in a susceptible population. Whenever ​R​ is
greater than one, epidemic transition becomes possible and within the Wuhan province, ​R​ has
been estimated as high as 4.1​1–3​.
While ​R​ is a useful indicator, it is not necessarily constant across geographic regions. Variation
in climate, population density, demographics, social interactions, health care access and public
health interventions can all affect transmission. It is thus important to re-evaluate the
transmissibility of 2019-nCoV in different settings. For example, as of February 7, 2020 there
have been twelve cases of 2019-nCoV in the United States​4​. Ten cases are due to importation
and two are due to person-to-person transmission within the United States. A key question is
whether this is consistent with the ​R​ seen in Wuhan, and whether epidemic spread is possible in
the United States.
Here we present a simple analysis for monitoring the upper bound of estimates for ​R​ in settings
where there are very few cases of disease. This has immediate relevance to the 2019-nCoV
virus, but can also be applied to other infectious diseases in the early stage of an epidemic. We
focus particular attention on the threshold at which epidemic transition appears possible.
Our method draws from prior work which showed that the number of cases caused by each
infection is modelled well by considering both the strength and heterogeneity in disease
transmission via a negative binomial offspring distribution​5​. When there are a total ​N​p​ primary
cases due to importation and ​N​s​ secondary cases due to human-to-human spread, maximum

likelihood techniques can be used to infer the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval for ​R
(Figure 1A)​6​.

Figure 1: Evaluating the plausibility of subcritical transmission. ​A) The
upper limit of the 95% confidence interval for the basic reproduction number, ​R​,
is plotted as a function of the number of observed primary cases, ​N​p.​ Each
colored lined corresponds to a different number of observed secondary cases ​N​s.​
The black dot shows the case count as of Feb 6, 2020. SInce it falls below ​R​ = 1,
the observed cases are currently consistent with subcritical transmission
(assuming there are not any pre-symptomatic secondary cases yet to be
observed). A dispersion parameter of 0.3 is assumed, which allows a high degree
of disease heterogeneity. B) The number of secondary cases that can be

observed before endemic transmission is possible (i.e. upper limit of 95%
confidence of ​R​ is greater than 1). The plot shows the dependence on several
values of the dispersion parameter, ​k.​ The green curve corresponds to the panel
A.
From a public health perspective, a particularly important piece of knowledge is how many
secondary cases can be observed before endemic transmission is possible (Figure 1B). The
threshold of secondary cases that can occur before endemic transmission is possible depends
on the dispersion parameter. The higher the dispersion parameter is, the smaller the confidence
interval for ​R​ is, and the threshold number of secondary cases before epidemic transmission is
possible becomes larger​5​. For example, for the current ​N​p​ value of 10, the threshold of
secondary cases allowing endemic transmission is 2, 3, 5 and 9 for dispersion value of 0.2, 0.3,
0.5 and 1 respectively. For figure 1A, a dispersion parameter of 0.3 is assumed which is on the
low side of what is typically observed​3​. This is a conservative estimate and contrasts with the
traditional value of one which corresponds to the SIR model of homogenous transmission​7​.
Importantly, this approach assumes that none of the observed cases remains infectious and that
there are no patients who are already infected but are pre-symptomatic. This may be a
reasonable assumption if transmission primarily occurs when patients are symptomatic and if
symptomatic patients are quickly quarantined. However, until there has been a substantial gap
in time (at least one serial interval) since a patient is quarantined this assumption cannot be
validated. This approach also does not account for the possibility of symptomatic cases that
remain unobserved. Further, subcriticality in one subpopulation does not imply subcriticality in
other populations. In addition, if the capacity for isolation is exceeded due to an excess of
imported cases, subcriticality now does not imply subcriticality in the future.
In conclusion, based solely on the observed number of cases so far, the current case count for
2019 nCoV in the United States currently supports subcritical transmission because the upper
limit of ​R​ is less than one. This result holds even when a high degree of heterogeneity is
permitted (e.g. a dispersion of 0.3). However, it is too early to make a definitive statement about
subcriticality because there may still be cases that are pre-symptomatic. This simple approach
for assessing whether subcritical transmission is plausible may be applicable to other diseases,
such as avian influenza, with low case counts.
