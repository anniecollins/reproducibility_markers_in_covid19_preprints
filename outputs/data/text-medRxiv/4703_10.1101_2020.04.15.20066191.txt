Abstract (250 words)
Aims: To determine analytical capabilities of a commonly used faecal immunochemical test
(FIT) to detect haemoglobin (Hb) in the context of NICE guidance DG30, and the likely use
of FIT to reprioritise patients delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Methods: Data obtained from independent verification studies and clinical testing of the HMJACKarc FIT method in routine primary care practice were analysed to derive analytical
performance characteristics.
Results: Detection capabilities for the FIT method were 0.5 µg/g (limit of blank), 1.1 (limit of
detection) and 15.0 µg/g (limit of quantification). 31 of 33 (94%) non-homogenised
specimens analysed in triplicate were consistently categorised relative to 10 µg/g compared
to all 33 (100%) homogenised specimens. Imprecision in non-homogenised specimens was
higher (median 27.8%, (range 20.5% - 48.6%)) than in homogenised specimens (10.2%, (7.0
to 13.5%)). Considerable variation was observed in sequential clinical specimens from
individual patients but no positive or negative trend in specimen degradation was observed
(p=0.26).
Conclusions: The FIT method is capable of detecting Hb at concentrations well below the
DG30 threshold of 10 µg/g. However, total imprecision is considerable when including
sampling variation. Binary categorisation against a single defined threshold above and below
10 µg/g was more consistent and improved following specimen homogenisation. This
approach may be more appropriate when reporting results for symptomatic patients tested in
primary care, including those who have had definitive investigation delayed by the COVID19 pandemic and need to be re-prioritised.

Key Messages
Faecal immunochemical testing (FIT) is increasingly used to detect blood at low
haemoglobin (Hb) concentrations in specimens from symptomatic primary care patients but
the analytical characteristics in this context have not been fully documented.
A commonly used FIT method showed good capability in a routine UK clinical setting to
detect Hb at the NICE recommended threshold of 10µg/g. Imprecision estimates were
considerable when sampling was considered, even above the limit of quantification of 15
µg/g.
Analytical variability appears too high for reliable reporting of quantitative Hb
concentrations: reporting positive or negative results around a threshold of 10µg/g appears
more appropriate after sample homogenisation.
Dichotomous FIT reporting is likely to be an important tool to risk stratify patients with
lower GI cancer symptoms who have had their test deferred due to the COVID-19 pandemic

Introduction
Colorectal cancer is globally the third most incident malignancy (1). It is surgically treatable
with improved long-term outcomes if diagnosis is at an early stage (2). Most developed
countries, including the UK, operate colorectal screening programmes using faecal occult
blood testing. Screen detected cancers benefit from early diagnosis and treatment, with
associated improved survival (2). Faecal immunochemical tests (FIT) have largely replaced
the traditional guaiac based faecal occult blood tests due to the increased specificity of FIT.
To complement the UK Bowel Cancer Screening Programme (UKBCSP), the 2017 DG30
NICE guidance (3) recommended the use of FIT for faecal haemoglobin (Hb) detection in
patients presenting to primary care with low risk abdominal symptoms. The adoption of FIT
in primary care has been slow, with notable variation in uptake and implementation across
the UK (4). The Oxford University Hospitals Trust (OUH) adopted FIT prior to the DG30
guidance to comply with the 2015 NG12 NICE guidance for suspected cancer (6), which
recommended the use of faecal occult blood testing in symptomatic patients. This coincided
with a desire from the clinical laboratory to move away from the comparatively inaccurate
guaiac based method. FIT was commissioned by Oxfordshire Clinical Commissioning Group
(OCCG) as a direct access test for General Practitioners in 2016 following a study by this
group comparing the accuracy of the guaiac and FIT methods in symptomatic primary care
patients meeting NG12 criteria (5).
Despite gradual uptake of FIT, there remains a clear need to understand FIT method
characteristics (7). FIT testing, whether undertaken within a screening programme or applied
to a symptomatic population, is dependent on the analytical performance of the laboratory
procedures used. These analytical characteristics, most crucially sampling, impact on the way
the results are most accurately reported (8). Whilst there has been significant work
undertaken in the context of screening (9) there is less data available in the symptomatic
population. This is important to explore as the characteristics of the population for a
screening programme, and the associated specimens, may differ from patients presenting with
symptoms. For example, the age-range of the symptomatic population is broader and
specimen characteristics, including faecal consistency, will likely differ in patients with
changes in bowel habit, and the information and support for taking a sample is less. This may
affect sample, and sampling integrity.
The FIT methods used to process samples from symptomatic patients are those developed for
measuring faecal Hb at higher concentrations in screening. At present, the cut-off used by the
UKBCSP is >120 µg/g, with future plans to reduce this to approximately 50 µg/g to improve
sensitivity. The threshold recommended for use with symptomatic patients in DG30 is 10
µg/g. FIT methods may not be optimised, or fully characterised, for detection at the lower
concentrations now being considered important for application in DG30 (7).
While introduction of FIT into primary care cancer pathways is limited at present, given the
large backlog of endoscopy created by the COVID-19 pandemic it is almost certain the
widespread use of low cut off FIT testing will be introduced immediately the pandemic has
passed to risk stratify all patient referred with possible cancer symptoms into groups for
urgent and less urgent endoscopy. Understanding low cut off FIT test performance in the
context of symptomatic patients is therefore a priority.

In the present study we present our observations and assessment of FIT method performance
since introduction of the test into routine clinical practice for a symptomatic primary care
population over a three year period. We include estimates of analytical performance,
observations on longer term method performance, sampling reproducibility in homogenised
compared to non-homogenised material, and consistency is sequential specimens from the
same patients.

Methods
Setting and analytical method
A single laboratory undertaking centralised analysis of FIT requests, mainly from primary
care, for the 680,000 population of Oxfordshire.
FIT analysis was undertaken using the HM-JACKarc analyser (Kyowa Medex Co., Ltd.,
Tokyo, Japan) (ref Guildford report) which has a calibration range of 7 to 450 µg Hb/g
faeces. This method was introduced into service prior to NICE guidance defining 10 µg/g as
the threshold defined for detection and we used 7 µg/g, the lowest calibrator value as the
threshold for a positive result
All specimens were requested by NHS primary care clinicians and collected into standard
stool pots by patients, a sampling approach taken due to concerns about sampling capability
when undertaken by (often elderly) patients (5). Clinician advice from OUH and OCCG
included guidance on delivering the sample to the laboratory on the same day as collection as
Hb can degrade on storage (10). On arrival in the laboratory the stool specimens were
sampled using the Extel Hemo-Auto MC designed for application with the HM-JACKarc by
laboratory staff competency assessed in this technique. The whole sampling procedure was
undertaken in a fume cupboard by staff with standard laboratory protective equipment and
involved a 30 second vortex mix which for most specimens was adequate for release of the
faecal pellet collected into the dimples/grooves of the picker. All specimens were visually
inspected to ensure complete suspension of specimen and if it was noted any residual
specimen adherence mixing continued until all material was removed.
Method detection capability estimates and immunoassay reproducibility
The FIT method limit of blank (LOB), limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification
(LOQ) were estimated as recently recommended (7). As it was not possible to obtain a
genuine faecal sample, assured as having no Hb analyte present, sample blank readings were
utilised to estimate LOB. LOD was calculated using the LOB + 1.645 (SD) of samples with
“very low concentrations”, considered to be those giving FIT results those between 0.5µg/g
an 1.0 µg/g.
LOQ was estimated from an imprecision profile constructed from faecal samples analysed in
duplicate across a wide FIT concentration range of naturally Hb positive material and was
taken as the concentration at which the percent coefficient of variation (%CV) was 10%. A
10%CV was selected as this has been recommended as an appropriate imprecision threshold
for FIT method LOQ evaluation (7). An additional within batch imprecision estimate was
made using a dilution of the supplier’s internal quality control (IQC) material. This was
prepared to give a concentration near to the anticipated LOD to assess whether the behaviour
of IQC material in the assay system with respect to imprecision was similar to true samples.
The on-instrument intermediate imprecision (not including sampling into the collection
device) was estimated from two level IQC materials provided by the manufacturer over
several months to include the effects of different analysts, reagent lot numbers and calibration
material lot numbers.

Effects of sample homogenisation
It is unclear whether Hb is evenly distributed in faeces therefore we investigated the Hb
concentration before and after sample homogenization. Randomly selected faecal specimens
arriving in standard stool containers were sampled in triplicate, homogenized and then
resampled a further three times. This resulted in six estimates of the result (3 nonhomogenised replicates and 3 homogenised replicates) with the imprecision presented as the
%CV of each set of three replicates. Individual stool specimen replicates were sampled by the
same member of staff but overall three different members of laboratory staff were involved in
this part of the study.
Stability of specimens within the collection device
FIT analysis was undertaken as a batch once or twice per week. To verify the stability of Hb
in the buffered collection device a selection of specimens were analysed at three time points
(at time zero, at 6 days and at 21 days).
Within patient serial sampling
Prior to January 2016 the standard practice with the guaiac method was to collect serial
samples. Despite revised guidance, recommending only a single specimen was required for
FIT, many primary care clinicians continued to request more than one. This may have been
due to clinicians being unaware of revised guidance or because there remained doubt about
test credibility and the additional reassurance multiple specimens might provide (11,12).
Sequential samples were delivered to the lab on the same day allowing assessment of delayed
analysis on FIT concentration. These sequential specimens represented maximum within
patient error as Hb concentrations reflected total variability (between day biological
variation, analyte instability, sampling error and immunoassay method imprecision).
Statistical analysis
Differences between the imprecision of sampling between non-homogenised and
homogenised sampling were assessed using a Wilcoxon rank test with continuity correction,
the null hypothesis being that the distribution of x – y (%cv in homogenised group – %cv in
non-homogenised group) is symmetric about 0.
For patients with multiple specimens and discordant results (that is, at least one result greater
than, and at least one result less than 10 ug/g), we examined whether there was an association
between the likelihood of a positive result and delay in processing the specimen in the
laboratory of 48 or 72 hours. In this group, we also examined whether there was an
association between a positive result and the sequence number of the specimen. Both were
assessed using the Chi-squared test.

Results
Detection capabilities and immunoassay reproducibility
Limit of the blank (LOB) – The mean FIT result of the sample blank run as part of the
method IQC over 100 consecutive batches over 11 months and three different reagent batches
was 0.20 µg/g, SD 0.16 µg/g, from which a derived LOB was 0.47 µg/g.
Limit of detection (LOD) – As the method only reports to one decimal place we considered
this to be 0.5 µg/g for practical purposes. 51 samples with apparent concentrations between
0.5 and 1.0 µg/g measured in duplicate were considered “very low concentrations” and
suitable for calculation of an SD for the LOD calculation. The derived SD was 0.35 µg/g
from which an LOD of 1.1 µg/g was derived (from LOB + 1.645SD).
Limit of quantification (LOQ) – LOQ was calculated from a precision profile (Figure 1)
constructed using data from 132 paired, within-batch replicates, analysed in seven different
batches over a one week period. Three samples with concentrations above the highest
calibrant concentration, 450 µg/g, were excluded from the analysis. The imprecision was
13% at approximately 7 µg/g (the lowest calibrator value), 11.5% at 10 µg/g (The NICE
threshold for detection) and 10% at 15 µg/g. The 10% imprecision threshold has been
recommended as the LOQ for FIT (7) and therefore 15 µg/g was considered to be this assay
characteristic.
Method precision and reproducibility - The within-batch imprecision characteristics of a
highly diluted IQC material were mean 1.5 µg/g, SD 0.5 µg/g, %CV 33.9 %. Estimation of
on-instrument method precision utilised quality control data collected over 12 months during
which time four different lot numbers were used (table 1).
Method reproducibility, expressed as %CV, for the low IQC material with a concentration of
around 26 µg/g ranged from 6.6% to 8.7% and for the high IQC material, concentration
around 90 µg/g ranged from 4.5% to 6.8%.
Effects of sample homogenisation
31 (94%) of 33 non-homogenised samples were consistent with respect to their categorisation
as above or below the 10 µg/g (figure 2). 27 had a mean result below 10 µg/g (negative) and
6 had mean results above (positive). Four had all three replicates above the LOQ and
imprecision estimates were calculated: median %CV of 27.8%, range 20.5% to 48.6%.
Two further samples had two replicates below the LOQ which prevented accurate calculation
of imprecision but had discrepant result relative to the 10 µg/g NICE threshold. One
specimen had replicates of <1.1, <1.1, 34.5 µg/g (two below the LOD and one above the
LOQ). Clinical details of this patient were PR bleeding and endoscopy showed an 8mm polyp
in the sigmoid. Histology revealed the polyp to be non-dysplastic and hyper-plastic and this
patient was discharged. The second of these discrepant results had replicates <1.1, <1.1, 14.7
µg/g (two below the LOD and one between the LOD and LOQ and positive relative to the
NICE threshold of 10 µg/g). This patient was being followed up by an established vague
symptoms pathway (13) and whilst nothing abnormal was detected after 9 months of followup, at the time of patient assessment they were noted to be taking NSAID.

In the homogenised specimen group, all 33 (100%) specimens were consistent with respect to
their categorisation as above or below the 10 µg/g (figure 2). 28 had a mean result below 10
µg/g (negative) and 5 had mean results above (positive). Categorisation as positive or
negative results was consistent in all replicates relative to a threshold of 10 µg/g. Four of the
specimens in the homogenised set had all three replicates above the LOQ and imprecision
estimates were calculated: median %CV of 10.2%, range 7.0 to 13.5%. This was lower but
not statistically significant (p = 0.10) than the imprecision observed in the non-homogenised
samples.
Stability of specimens within the collection device
15 specimens selected as their initial result was above the LOD, (8 below the LOQ and 7
above) were repeat tested. All 15 specimens had consistent categorisation when repeat tested
at 6 days compared to the initial result (positive or negative relative to the 10 µg/g threshold).
At 21 days all but one specimen were consistently categorised however, however one had
fallen from 25 to 6 µg/g. For the 7 specimens above the LOQ there was no statistical
difference at 6 (p=0.95) or 21 days (p=0.93).
Within patient serial sampling – 524 patients sent more than one sample within a 3 month
period: 302 returned 2 specimens; 222 returned 3; 2 returned 4; and 1 returned 5. Of the 225
patients with 3 or more specimens, 197 (87.6%) had concordant results for all specimens
(188 negative, 9 positive). 28 (12.4%) had discordant results, that is, at least one value more,
and at least one value less, than 10 µg/g.
There was no obvious trend on visual review of plots of individual patient’s FIT values over
time (figure 3), and no association between the likelihood of a positive result based on either
a delay of more than 2 days in the specimen reaching the laboratory (p = 0.84, Chi-squared
test). There was no association between the likelihood of a positive results and the number
in the sequence of a particular patient’s specimens (p = 0.21, Chi-squared test),

Discussion
Current proposals for FIT testing at low concentrations are dependent on accurate LOD and
LOQ estimates (7). In this evaluation we have derived these detection characteristics for a
commonly used FIT method. The LOB (0.5 µg/g), LOD (1.1 µg/g) are considerably lower
than the Hb concentration of 10 µg/g designated by NICE as the threshold for further patient
investigation. The LOQ, if defined as the Hb concentration where imprecision is 10%CV (7)
was observed to be 15.0 µg/g. These detection capability estimates would suggest that at 10
µg/g the method is sensitive enough to be confident that Hb is present but not about the
absolute value below 15 µg/g.
The immunoassay method imprecision is good when assessed using non-clinical IQC
material, being consistently <9%, even over an 8 month period. A diluted IQC material at a
concentration (1.5 µg/g) near to the LOD (1.1 µg/g) showed an imprecision of 33.9%, higher
than the precision profile line of fit derived with clinical material but reflective of highly
variable imprecision at these lower concentrations. The concentration of Hb present in the
two IQC materials provided by the manufacturer, at around 25 µg/g and 95 µg/g. These were
presumably selected to be clinically appropriate for use in screening programmes where
decisions thresholds are higher. When the clinical interest shifts to lower concentrations, we
would suggest a strategy of using IQC materials with values below and above 10 µg/g.
Imprecision rises when faecal sampling is taken into consideration: average imprecision in
homogenised specimens was 10.2% and in non-homogenised specimens was 27.8%, with
upper estimates of 13.5% and 48.6%, respectively. Additionally, inconsistent classification
was observed with respect to the 10 µg/g threshold in two further samples not assessed for
imprecision due to some or all of the values being below the LOQ. This would suggest that
Hb is not uniformly distributed in the faecal specimen, a finding consistent with other faecal
constituents. For example, a 1H NMR spectroscopy study of faeces (14) highlighted both
heterogeneity and instability of a range of metabolic constituents. Also, whilst there is limited
evidence to support the practice it is common for specimens for faecal elastase and
calprotectin to include a homogenisation step prior to analysis. Future work must further
establish the potential benefit of homogenisation in relation to FIT. We note that, in two
specimens, one of the three non-homogenised results was positive compared with none in the
homogenised specimens. This might lead to speculation that homogenisation leads to false
negative results by reducing the amount of Hb to the average in the stool specimen. Neither
of these patients have had a diagnosis of colorectal cancer, more than 1 year after the
specimens were first obtained.
The stability of the Hb in the sampling device buffer appears reasonable at 6 days and for
most specimens up to 21 days. However, one specimen showed notable deterioration at 21
days from above to below the current 10 µg/g threshold. In a DG30 service setting a
minimum weekly FIT batch analysis would minimise the potential of this degradation to
misclassify results.
Our serial sample data provides some insights into sample variability and enables some
comment on sample stability. It is well established that Hb degrades in faecal material (10)
and this presents a potential for false negatives as the concentration may fall beneath that
considered positive or detected. In the serial samples from patients we do not know the
magnitude of degradation in individual specimens but we found no statistical difference with

respect to categorical positive or negative results with this time series of specimens. Our
analysis is limited in that the intervals between specimens are variable. It is possible that the
variability between days (a component of biological variability) and from sampling (a
component of analytical variability) may be larger than the concentration changes associated
with degradation: if sample degradation were the dominant variable it would be expected that
the time series analysis would be significant.
Comparisons to previous literature.
In a previous study (15) of the diagnostic accuracy of one vs two specimens it was concluded
that two specimens offered no advantage over one specimen. Sequential results of 400 µg/g
were sometimes followed by <10 µg/g from the same patient taken a median of 6 days apart.
It is not certain whether these differences are due to biological variation, inconsistent
bleeding or sampling imprecision. A study (16) of the utility of two sample strategies for
colorectal cancer in a symptomatic population it was noted that there was 39.2% nonconcordance between the first FIT result and the maximum FIT result. It would therefore
appear that whatever strategy is used, bleeding from a lesion may be inconsistent and any
single sample will, on average, detect with the same degree of diagnostic accuracy. Of note,
previous studies of FIT in symptomatic patients have noted a small number of false negatives
(4). In a recent study (17) using FIT in a symptomatic population in a 2 week wait pathway
12.5% of colorectal cancers were missed using a single patient collected specimen using a
threshold of 10 µg/g. The method utilised was different from the one utilised in our
laboratory study, the OC-SensorTM (Eiken Chemical Company, Tokyo, Japan) and had a
reported detection limit of 4 µg/g. As with other studies it is not certain whether these false
negative results were due to variable patterns of bleeding, poor sampling by the patient, or
another cause. The study also noted that the majority of FIT results from patients with
colorectal cancer had very high values (>150 µg/g) which would suggest these cases should
be referred with higher priority.
Implications for research and practice.
There is on-going debate as to how FIT results should be reported from those that consider
the result as “detected”/“not detected” through to quantitative reporting of numeric values
(4,7). Given the high imprecision of analysis when sampling is taken into consideration we
would caution against quantitative reporting of faecal Hb due to the high uncertainty of
measurement. Further audit of larger datasets derived from symptomatic patients in routine
clinical practice are required to provide evidence of the association between Hb concentration
and clinical outcomes and to further inform qualitative reporting strategies. The binary nature
of reporting that we suggest may make for more straightforward pathways for the triage of
patients who have been deferred due to the COVID-19 pandemic and require re-prioritisation
into urgent and less urgent groups.
The quality assurance of faecal tests, including FIT, presents unique analytical challenges
compared to most clinical specimens used for diagnostic testing, such as whole blood, serum,
plasma or urine. This is demonstrable in the lack of verification data in native faecal material
available from manufacturers supplying sampling devices. Existing data, depend upon
synthetic material. It also presents challenges to laboratories with respect to both IQC and
EQA. In our laboratory, we have commenced analysis of samples collected directly by
patients into the collection device and noted that, despite collection guidance leaflets, a
YouTube video and targeted training of staff advising patients, many samples arrive with

faecal material clearly on the outside of the container and no specimen apparent in the buffer.
Anecdotally, we have noted in many of the samples where sample integrity is questionable
from visual inspection of the collection device, the patient is over 75 years of age.
Collection of samples in patients where there has been a change in bowel habit represents
specific additional challenges and stool water content can vary between 60 and 82% (18).
The dilutional effect of this will impact on quantitative measures and the lack of form will
affect entrapment of the specimen itself in the manufacturer’s collection device. We have
noted a minority of specimens where considerably more than a 30 second vortex is required
to suspend the faecal matter into the buffer. Protocols for how to manage these challenging
specimens observed in the symptomatic population are lacking. Furthermore there is
considerable concern about risk of faecal-oral or aerosol transmission of COVID-19 (19) and
the risks of sample manipulation and the need for a period of very high throughput need to be
balanced against analytic accuracy.
The evaluation of collection device robustness is particularly important to continue. One
detailed study has reported that collection devices can be used effectively even when not used
as recommended by the manufacturers (20). Whilst it demonstrated significant differences in
the absolute FIT concentration the effect on diagnostic performance was small. As with our
study the testing involved specimen homogenisation and sampling in a laboratory to reduce
variability.
Concluding remarks.
In summary we have found that a commonly used FIT method shows good consistency of
categorising Hb results against the DG30 threshold, and therefore appears suitable for this
clinical application. However, there appear numerous sources of variability that require
further investigation and optimisation. It is therefore important that all FIT studies identify
the relative contributions of biological variation, sampling technique, Hb stability and method
performance to false negative results as these are consistently observed in the literature. The
high imprecision precludes reporting of quantitative FIT concentrations and on current
analytical performance we consider a categorical approach, for example negative or positive
relative to recommendation of a 2 week wait referral is more appropriate, potentially
simplifying pathways to reprioritise patients with lower GI cancer symptoms who have had
definitive diagnosis delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic.
