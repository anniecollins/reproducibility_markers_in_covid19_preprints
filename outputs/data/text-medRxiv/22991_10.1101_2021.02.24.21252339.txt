Contact tracing, where exposed individuals are followed up to break ongoing transmission
chains, is a key pillar of outbreak response for many infectious disease outbreaks, such as
Ebola and SARS-CoV-2. Unfortunately, these systems are not fully effective, and cases can
still go undetected as people may not know or remember all of their contacts or contacts
may not be able to be traced. A large proportion of undetected cases suggests poor contact
tracing and surveillance systems, which could be a potential area of improvement for a
disease response. In this paper, we present a novel method for estimating the proportion of
cases that are not detected during an outbreak. Our method uses next generation matrices
that are parameterized by linked contact tracing and case line-lists. We use this method to
investigate the proportion of undetected cases in two case studies: the SARS-CoV-2
outbreak in New Zealand during 2020 and the West African Ebola outbreak in Guinea
during 2014. We estimate that only 6% of SARS-CoV-2 cases were not detected in New

Zealand (95% credible interval: 1.31 – 16.7%), but over 60% of Ebola cases were not
detected in Guinea (95% credible interval: 15 - 90%).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------There are many non-pharmaceutical interventions for controlling infectious disease
epidemics. Some control measures, such as case isolation and safe and dignified burials for
Ebola, avoid secondary cases but others, such as contact tracing, avoid tertiary cases.
Measures, which avoid secondary cases, are most effective when tertiary cases are also
avoided and all (or nearly all) cases are identified so that interventions can be targeted to
those who are infected and those who have been exposed (1). If contact tracing is
implemented well, contacts of known cases can take precautions to reduce onward
transmission by limiting their contacts and isolating quickly on symptom onset (2–4).
However, if many cases are not detected, outbreaks can grow rapidly as undetected cases
usually infect more people than detected cases (5).
Cases or deaths may not be reported for a variety of reasons (6). Poor availability of tests at
the start of an outbreak of an emerging pathogen, such as SARS-CoV-2, may mean that
those with symptoms cannot be diagnosed (7). Asymptomatic individuals may also not
know they are infected unless tested for other reasons, such as through contact tracing or
for routine medical care (8). Undetected cases are not unique to COVID-19 and underreporting is common in Ebola outbreaks due to barriers to accessing health care and limited
hospital capacity meaning many cases are not hospitalized and are less likely to be reported
(9). Many patients may not seek health care due to mistrust and if they die, may be buried
without notification, leading again to those cases being missed from official lists (10).
Infectious disease analysis and modelling are important tools for managing epidemics and
can help provide quantitative evidence and situational awareness to government and public
health responses (11). The importance of such analyses has been highlighted by the
response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has been, to a large extent, informed by
epidemic modelling e.g. (12–14). However, these models often require robust case data to

make accurate transmission predictions. Over time attempts have been made to account for
under-reporting in models. Some models assume perfect reporting (15,16), however, this
can lead to an underestimation of the infection rate (6). Other methods assume a constant
under-reporting rate (17) or use data augmentation techniques (6). More recently, many
models have switched to using death data, which was believed to be more reliable than case
data, because it is more likely consistent over time and between countries (13). This is
especially important for methods which are robust to constant under-reporting.
We propose using a quasi-Bayesian next generation matrix (NGM) approach in this paper
to estimate the proportion of cases that are not detected in an outbreak. This method is not
disease specific and is simple to implement from contact tracing and surveillance data. The
calculation can also be repeated throughout the outbreak to provide time varying estimates.
We present two applications of our method: the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in New Zealand in
2020 and the 2014 Ebola epidemic in Guinea.

METHODS
NGMs are often used to calculate the basic reproduction number (the average number of
secondary infections generated by a primary infection in a large fully susceptible
population), 𝑅! , from a finite number of discrete categories that are based on
epidemiologically relevant traits in the population, such as infected individuals at different
stages of infection (e.g. exposed and infectious) or with different characteristics (e.g. age).
The NGM is a matrix which quantifies the number of secondary infections generated in
each category by an infected individual in a given category. 𝑅! is defined as the dominant
eigenvector of this matrix (18,19). Here, we stratify infected individuals using information
about their contact tracing status and whether they were being followed up at the time of
symptom onset to assign infection pathways and construct our NGM. We identify three
types of cases: i) cases that are not detected (ND), ii) cases that are detected but not under
active surveillance (NAS), and (iii) cases that are detected and under active surveillance

(AS). Contact follow-up or surveillance takes different forms for different diseases; for
Ebola, a contact under active surveillance would be undergoing in-person follow-up for 21
days after their last interaction with the case (20), whereas for COVID-19, a contact under
active surveillance would have been notified by contact tracers, or through a mobile phone
application, and asked to self-isolate for up to 10 days (21,22).
Formulation of the NGM
For contact tracing to be fully effective, the parent (or primary) case needs to be diagnosed
and, if positive, all their contacts placed under active surveillance. The parent case
therefore needs to know and remember everyone they have been in close contact with
whilst they have been infectious and for these contacts to be contacted. Despite a contact
being recalled and reported, they may not be under active surveillance if they cannot be
identified due to missing or incorrect contact details or evasion from contact tracers. We
assume in our model that: i) cases that are not detected and those cases detected but not
under active surveillance have the same effective reproduction number (R) and therefore on
average, infect the same number of secondary cases; and ii) contacts under surveillance
who become cases have a lower effective reproduction number (scaled by 𝛼) because they
are rapidly isolated after the onset of symptoms. We define 𝜙 as the proportion of contacts
recalled, 𝛾 as the proportion of contacts actively under surveillance, and 𝜋 as the proportion
of cases detected or “re-captured” by community surveillance
We identify 12 pathways through which individuals can become infected by three different
types of cases (Figure 1). These pathways are described as follows:
1.

A case that was detected (with probability 𝜋), who was infected by a case that was not
detected and was therefore not under active surveillance.

2.

A case that was not detected (with probability 1-𝜋), who was infected by a case that
was not detected and was therefore not under active surveillance.

Seven of our twelve pathways result in detected cases. The cases from pathways 3, 4, 8, and
9 are individuals on contact lists who are detected as cases whereas, the cases from
pathways 1, 6, and 11 are de novo cases that are not on any contact tracing list, but which
are detected via other routes such as attending a health care unit. The cases from pathways
3 and 8 are contacts who were under surveillance at the time of symptom onset, while those
from pathways 4 and 9 were not under surveillance at onset. The cases resulting from the
pathways 2, 5, 7, 10 and 12 are not detected by the surveillance system. We use the
notation FX to denote the probability of a case stemming from pathway X, for example F1
equals 𝑅𝜋.

Cases are often recorded in line-lists during disease outbreaks, where dates of testing,
symptom onset and hospitalization are recorded alongside information about the age and
sex of the patient. When case lists are linked to contact lists, we can derive two ratios with
which we parameterize our NGM. We define 𝑟% as the ratio of cases who were contacts but
not under surveillance versus the cases who were contacts and under surveillance and 𝑟( as
the ratio of de novo cases (cases that were not known contacts) versus detected cases that
were contacts and under surveillance.
Following the pathways in Figure 1, we expand 𝑟% (the ratio of cases who were contacts but
not under surveillance versus the cases who were contacts and under surveillance) as

surveillance (rapid isolation upon symptom onset), 𝜙 is the proportion of contacts recalled and

under active surveillance are detected. The colouring and shape of the end points of the paths are
described as follows: red circle - any case that was not detected (so cannot be under active
surveillance), purple circle - an eventually detected case that was not under active surveillance at
the time of symptom onset (e.g. a contact of an earlier case lost to follow-up or who refused followup), purple square: a detected case that was under active surveillance at the time of symptom onset
(e.g. a contact of a previously detected case, correctly recalled and reported, and under

Figure 2 illustrates the dependencies between these two ratios and the parameters in our
model in a directed acyclic graph where the green nodes are our data, blue nodes are model
parameters and white nodes are calculated parameters.

In addition to equations (5) and (7), we also have three more relationships that we can use
to parameterize our NGM: the proportions of each type of case (𝜇&' , 𝜇&./ and 𝜇./ ) that
are found using the leading eigenvector of the NGM (see SIA). We therefore have five
equations and seven unknown parameters (𝜋, 𝛼, 𝜙, 𝛾, 𝜇&' , 𝜇&./ , 𝜇./ ). If we fix two, we
can derive estimates of the five remaining parameters. For example, if we fix 𝜋 and 𝜙, we
can then estimate 𝛾 directly from equation 5. As shown by the derivation in SIA, the
parameters 𝜇&' , 𝜇&./ and 𝜇./ are defined as a function of 𝛼, the scaling on the level of
transmission when under surveillance (𝛼 = 0 perfect control and 𝛼 = 1 no impact of
surveillance on transmission). Equation 7 also expresses 𝜇&' as a function of 𝛼, 𝜇&./ and
𝜇./ (the proportions of the two contact traced groups). By replacing 𝜇&./ and 𝜇./ by their
eigenvector relationships, we can express 𝜇&' as a function of 𝛼 only. Therefore, the
system can be solved finding the intersection of the (𝛼, 𝜇% ) curves defined by the two
equations derived from the normalized eigenvector solution for 𝜇% and equation 7, see SIB
for a graphical example.

without an epidemiological link (26). We assume that 80% of contacts were under active
surveillance, since this was determined as the minimum requirement for the NZ system
(22). Therefore, we estimate 456 cases were under active surveillance and 114 cases were
not. This makes 𝑟% = 0.25 and 𝑟( = 0.20.

Ebola in Guinea 2014 We use data from Dixon et al. (27), which present contact tracing
outcomes from two prefectures in Guinea between the 20th September and 31st December
2014. The authors found that only 45 cases out of 152 were registered as contacts of known
cases across Kindia and Faranah prefectures.
Since there is little published data, we consider two scenarios based on different
assumptions about 𝑟% (ratio of contacts not under active surveillance versus contacts under
active surveillance).
1) We assume 𝑟% is equal to 0.2 (five times as many contacts under active surveillance
than not under active surveillance, or 5 out of 6 contacts are under active
surveillance). This is based on data from Liberia in 2014 and 2015 where, during
the same epidemic as Guinea, 27936 contacts were not under active surveillance,
whereas 167419 were (28). Since we know the total number of cases on the contact
tracing list, 45, and assume 𝑟% = 0.2, we estimate the number of contacts under
active surveillance to be 38 (denominator of 𝑟( ). The number of people not on the
contact list for the two regions was 107 (numerator of 𝑟( ). Therefore, 𝑟( is equal to
2.85.
2) We assume 𝑟% is equal to 0.5 (twice as many contacts under active surveillance than
not under active surveillance or two thirds of contacts are under active surveillance)
to illustrate the impact of a slightly better surveillance system. Since we know the
total number of cases on the contact tracing list, 45, and assume 𝑟% = 0.5, we
estimate the number of contacts under active surveillance to be 30 (denominator of
𝑟( ). Therefore, 𝑟( is equal to 3.57.
We estimated the proportion of cases that are not detected using a quasi-Bayesian
framework for both case studies. We sampled 100,000 values from [0,1]( uniformly for
(𝜋, 𝜙), which is comparable to assuming a uniform prior distribution, and computed the
other parameters (𝛾, 𝛼, 𝜇&' ) if a solution was viable. We note that there is no solution for
some values of (𝜋, 𝜙), (see SIB). Since we found our viable parameter space to be convex,

the mean parameter values calculated from our sampling may be a poor central estimate.
Therefore, we define our central estimate as the solution for the point in our viable
parameter space (𝜋, 𝜙) that is furthest from the boundary of our central region. We
calculate this using the polylabelr R package (29). Our credible intervals reflect the values
between which 95% of our viable samples lie. All code necessary to implement the analysis
is included open source in the “MissingCases” R package on GitHub (30).

RESULTS
SARS-CoV-2 in New Zealand 2020. In Figure 3, we find that the region of feasible
parameter space for SARS-CoV-2 was only 2.4% of the total space, which suggests high
certainty in our parameter estimates. It is also located in the top right corner of the
parameter space, where both the proportion of cases detected in the community( 𝜋) and
proportion of contacts (𝜙) are high. This suggests a well-functioning and rigorous contact
tracing and surveillance system in NZ, which our estimate that only 6.14% (95% CrI: 1.31 16.7%) of cases are not detected also suggests. All parameter estimates for this model are
given in Table 1.

Ebola in Guinea 2014. We find that our two assumptions for 𝑟% result in different feasible
parameter spaces, which overlap at high values (>75%) of the proportion of cases detected
in the community (𝜋), see Figure 4. The feasible region was again small for Scenario 1
when 𝑟% = 0.2 was 5.4% of the region [0,1]( and 4.3% for Scenario 2 when 𝑟% = 0.5. Our
estimates of the proportion of Ebola cases that were not detected in Guinea was 64.5%
(95% CrI: 15.5-89.3%) or 63.3% (95% CrI 15.9 – 83.0%) for our two scenarios where 𝑟% =
0.2 and 𝑟% = 0.5 respectively. These estimates are not significantly different despite our
two assumptions. The corresponding model parameter estimates for both scenarios are
given in Table 2. The only parameter that differs significantly between our scenario is the

proportion of contact under active surveillance, which is directly impacted by the ratio of
contacts not under active surveillance versus contacts under active surveillance.

DISCUSSION
Contact tracing is an important control mechanism for infectious disease outbreaks.
However, its efficiency depends on detecting as many cases as possible. We show in this
paper that NGMs can be easily used to estimate the proportion of cases that were not
detected for two different disease outbreaks. Our method requires much less data (only 5
parameters) that other methods, such as capture re-capture (10), which is an alternative
method suggested for estimating under-reporting and is highly data intensive. This means
that it is feasible to repeat this analysis in near real time as the epidemic unfolds.
During the West African Ebola epidemic, the WHO acknowledged that their reported case
and death figures “vastly underestimate(d)” the true magnitude of the epidemic (31). We
find that our estimates for the proportion of cases not detected in Guinea (64.5% (95% CrI:
15.5-89.3%) or 63.3% (95% CrI 15.9 – 83.0%) for our two scenarios where 𝑟% = 0.2 and
𝑟% = 0.5 respectively) are in line with values in the literature for neighbouring countries.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (32) estimated a 40% reporting rate
(60% under-reporting) from Ebola treatment unit bed data and Gignoux et al. (33)
estimated a 33% (67% under-reporting) from a capture and recapture study in Liberia
between June and August 2014. However, Dalziel et al. (9) suggested higher reporting rates
in Sierra Leone, for example 68% (32% under reporting) in the Western Area Urban on 20
October 2014 using burial data.
Our estimates of the proportion of cases that were not detected during the SARS-Cov-2
outbreak in NZ of 6.14% (95% CrI 1.31 - 16.7) is in-line with the good health care facilities
and the low community transmission of COVID-19 in NZ (26), but we did not find any
estimates in literature to compare our estimates to.

A benefit of this method is that we do not just estimate the proportion of cases that were not
detected but also other useful quantities that are important for managing a response such as
the proportion of cases that are detected in the community. Our central estimates for routine
surveillance of 82.5% (95% CrI: 60.6 – 95.9%) suggests that NZ was very effective at
detecting cases in the community during the SARS-Cov-2 outbreak. In contrast, our
estimates of 29.3% (95% CrI: 8.26-80.4%) and 31.7% (95% CrI 14.1-81.0%) suggests that
routine surveillance could have been an area for improvement during the West African
Ebola outbreak in Guinea. We also find that a higher proportion of contacts were recalled,
or membered, in the NZ SARS-Cov-2 outbreak 95.1% (95% CrI: 87.9-99.8%) compared to
the Ebola epidemic in Guinea (45.8% (95% CrI: 31.4-95.3%) and 54.5% (95% CrI: 32.497.1%)). This could reflect more trust in the NZ health service. The wide credible intervals
come from the uniform sample of (𝜋, 𝜙). This is a limitation of the method but could be
improved with more information about the numbers of contacts people had (𝜙) and a better
understanding of the performance of the routine surveillance (𝜋) to narrow the region.
We believe this method highlights important lessons for responding to the ongoing SARSCoV-2 pandemic and the unfortunate inevitability of future infectious disease outbreaks. By
simply linking the case line-lists and contact tracing lists, we can use the very general
method from our “MissingCases” package (30) to assess under-reporting throughout an
epidemic. This would help outbreak responses, especially during the early and late phases,
target resources and quantify how effect their surveillance systems were. In addition, these
estimates can be used to improve the accuracy of other models, such as for the time varying
reproduction number, which are key tools for the outbreak response themselves.

Using next generation matrices to estimate the proportion of cases that

Here we derive the proportion cases that are undetected using a framework where the
proportion of cases that are not detected does not directly depend on the values of the

We now show an example of the convergence of the system. We assume 𝜋 = 0.83, 𝛼 =
0.30, 𝛾 = 0.77 and 𝜙 = 0.95. We chose a distribution for 𝑅 to get some variability while
keeping a relatively contained epidemic.

a number of generations. The black dots are values derived from simulation while the red line shows the value
derived analytically.

We see that, as predicted by the analytic derivation, despite the unpredictable course of the
epidemics (Figure S1A), the proportion of missing cases quickly reaches an equilibrium
(Figure S1B). This proportion at equilibrium can be calculated using the formula derived
above. We note that the convergence is exponential and thus fast proving that 𝜆% ≫ 𝜆( and
𝜆% ≫ 𝜆, .

Supplementary Information B: Solution of the system of equations assuming parameters
We assume that 𝜋 = 0.83, 𝜙 = 0.95 and get 𝑟% = 0.25 and 𝑟( = 0.20 from the NZ data.
Using Equation 5, we estimate 𝛾 = 0.77. Solving the system gives the following solution:
𝛼 = 0.30 and 𝜇% = 0.06 meaning that in this configuration, 6% of the cases are not detected
and missing from the records. A graphical representation is given in Figure S2, where the
solution of the system can be seen at the intersection of the two curves. No solution is
found if the two curves do not intersect.
