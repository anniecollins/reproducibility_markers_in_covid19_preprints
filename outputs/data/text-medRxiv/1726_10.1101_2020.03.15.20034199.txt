Outbound traffic from Wuhan and COVID-19 incidence
ABSTRACT

Background: The city of Wuhan is the epicenter of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
outbreak and a central Chinese hub for transportation and industry. Mass migration prior to the
Chinese New Year may have accelerated the spread of COVID-19 across China. This analysis
investigated the temporal relationship between daily outbound traffic from Wuhan and the
incidence of COVID-19 in 31 Chinese provinces during January-February 2020.

Methods: We collected incidence of confirmed COVID-19 cases from National and Provincial
Health Committee reports from January 10 to February 29, 2020. Volume of outbound traffic
from Wuhan to other provinces was measured by Baidu Migration Index, a widely used metric
that tracks migration based on cellphone location. We used cross-correlation function and
autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model to examine time-lagged association
between traffic volume and COVID-19 incidence by province. Contributors to the provincial
variation in the temporal associations were investigated. Additionally, we estimated the
reduction in cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases following the travel ban for Wuhan.

Results: Cross-correlation function analyses suggested that the volume of outbound traffic from
Wuhan was positively associated with COVID-19 incidence in all provinces, with correlation
coefficients between 0.22-0.78 (all P<0.05). Approximately 42% of provinces showed <1 week
of lag between traffic volume and COVID-19 incidence, 39% with 1 week, and 19% with 2-3
weeks. Migration had more prolonged impacts in provinces closer to Wuhan and with more
passenger influx from Wuhan, but affected economically advantaged provinces to a lesser
extent. We further estimated that the travel ban may have prevented approximately 19,768
COVID-19 cases (95% CI: 13,589, 25,946) outside of Wuhan by February 29, 2020.

Conclusions: Outflowing migration from Wuhan facilitated the COVID-19 transmission to other
parts of China with varying time-lagged effects dependent on provincial characteristics. The
travel ban led to a significant reduction in COVID-19 outside of Wuhan.

Outbound traffic from Wuhan and COVID-19 incidence
INTRODUCTION

The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak occurred during the mass migration period
prior to the Chinese New Year in the city of Wuhan, Hubei province, a central Chinese hub for
transportation and industry. On January 23, a travel ban put the city of Wuhan under quarantine,
all transportations into and out of the city were canceled, impacting more than nine million
people. It is reported that more than five million people have left Wuhan in the days before the
travel ban [1], which may have accelerated the spread of COVID-19 to other provinces in China.
However, the dynamic relationship between outbound traffic from Wuhan and COVID-19
outbreak in other parts of China remains unclear.

Several analyses have evaluated the impact of migration on the COVID-19 outbreak. For
example, Du et al. estimated that COVID-19 may have been transported from Wuhan to more
than 130 Chinese cities and all four major metropolitan areas by January 23 [2]. Tian et al.
reported that the travel ban slowed the transmission of infection to other Chinese cities by an
average of 2.9 days [3]. Chinazzi et al. suggested that the travel ban delayed the overall
epidemic progression of COVID-19 in China by 3-5 days, and may reduce the number of cases
outside of China by 80% by the end of February [4]. Further, Jin et al. and Chen et al. reported
that the cumulative migration from Wuhan was highly correlated with the number of reported
cases in other provinces in China, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.5 to 0.9 [5, 6].
However, no study to date has estimated the time lag between traffic and disease incidence and
the total number of cases prevented by the travel ban.

This analysis aimed to fill in the gap by examining the time-lagged effect between the volume of
outbound traffic from Wuhan with the COVID-19 incidence in 31 Chinese provinces during
January-February 2020. We further evaluated the overall intervention effect of the Wuhan travel
ban by the end of February. Our study used time-series analysis to estimate the association
between travel volume and subsequent COVID-19 incidence, which is less biased as it
accounts for the strong autocorrelation within data that are generated from sequential
observations.

Outbound traffic from Wuhan and COVID-19 incidence
METHODS

Data

COVID-19 incidence data

We collected the incidence of confirmed COVID-19 cases from National and Provincial Health
Committee reports from January 10 to February 29, 2020. These reports were obtained from
official government websites and state-run media. Data were aggregated by date and province.

Traffic data

Traffic data were collected through the Baidu Migration Map (https://qianxi.baidu.com/), an
online interactive map developed by Baidu Inc. to display human migration volume for Chinese
cities. The map displays inbound and outbound traffic volumes for selected cities and dates.
Traffic volume is expressed as the Baidu Migration Index, a proprietary index derived based on
cell phone positioning data and is proportional to the daily total number of people traveling out of
Wuhan. Although the explicit relationship between the population size and the Baidu Migration
Index is unclear, previous analysis has estimated that one unit of the index corresponds to
approximately 44,520 travelers [4]. Using web scraping technique, we obtained the Baidu
Migration Index data for outbound traffic from Wuhan to the 31 Chinese provinces from January
10 to February 29, 2020. We also extracted the percentage of people who traveled to each
province from Baidu Migration Map. With these data, we estimated the volume of daily traffic
from Wuhan to each province, calculated as Volumeprovince,date = Total Volumedate ×
Percentageprovince,date . Data for the same Lunar calendar period in 2019 were used as
benchmark to make predictions for disease incidence if the travel ban had not been issued.

Contextual data for provinces

We included demographic, economic, and geographical factors that are potential contributors to
the provincial variation in the association between traffic volume and COVID-19 incidence.
These factors included geographical distance between Wuhan and each province’s capital city,
the average daily outbound traffic from Wuhan to each province, the gross domestic product
(GDP) per capita, and the population density of each province. Geographical distances between

Outbound traffic from Wuhan and COVID-19 incidence
cities were calculated based on their coordinates. Average traffic volumes were estimated
based on the 2019 Baidu Migration Index. Economic and demographical data were from the
Chinese Bureau of Statistics [7].

Statistical analyses

We used time series analyses, including cross-correlation function (CCF) and autoregressive
integrated moving average (ARIMA) model [8], to examine time-lagged association between
traffic volume and COVID-19 incidence. Time series analysis is appropriate because it
examines the correlation between two time series data and makes predictions while accounting
for any autocorrelation structure within each time series and any shared trends. We used the
CCF to understand the time-lagged correlation between traffic volume and COVID-19 incidence.
A prewhitening process was applied to the time-series data to avoid common trends between
traffic and CVID-19 incidence [9]. The prewhitening was conducted by first fitting an ARIMA
model on the x-variable and calculating the residuals, and then filtering the y variable using the
x-variable ARIMA model. The CCF assesses the correlation between the residuals from the xvariable ARIMA model and the filtered y values. In our case, the x variable is the daily traffic
volume time series and the y variable is the COVID-19 case time series. The non-seasonal
ARIMA model is generally denoted as ARIMA (𝑝, 𝑑, 𝑞), in which 𝑝 is the order of the
autoregression (AR) component, 𝑑 is the order of the differencing process to form a stationary
times series, and 𝑞 is the order of the moving average (MA) process. In an ARIMA model, the
value of 𝑦 at time 𝑡 is estimated as:
𝑦𝑡 = 𝜇 + 𝜑1 𝑦𝑡−1 + ⋯ + 𝜑𝑝 𝑦𝑡−𝑝 − 𝜃1 𝑒𝑡−1 − ⋯ − 𝜃𝑞 𝑒𝑡−𝑞
where 𝑦𝑡 is the value at time 𝑡, 𝜑 is the AR parameter, and 𝜃 is the MA parameter.
Additionally, we evaluated the potential reduction in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19
cases in other parts of China following the Wuhan travel ban. To account for the variation in the
association between traffic volume and COVID-19 incidence by province, we first classified
provinces according to their estimated time lag and correlation coefficients using K-means
clustering [10]. For each province cluster, we fitted an ARIMA model with traffic volume as an
external regressor, also known as an ARIMAX model. The ARIMAX model describes the value
of 𝑦 at time 𝑡 using the following equations:
𝑦𝑡 = 𝛽𝑥𝑡 + 𝑛𝑡
𝑛𝑡 = 𝜇 + 𝜑1 𝑦𝑡−1 + ⋯ + 𝜑𝑝 𝑦𝑡−𝑝 − 𝜃1 𝑒𝑡−1 − ⋯ − 𝜃𝑞 𝑒𝑡−𝑞

Outbound traffic from Wuhan and COVID-19 incidence
in which 𝑥𝑡 is a covariate at time 𝑡 and 𝛽 is its coefficient. The lag values identified by the crosscorrelation analysis was applied to traffic time series data in the ARIMAX model. The models
were fitted using data up to the expected turning point in COVID-19 incidence following the
travel ban. We used the median lag time for each cluster to determine the turning points. We
used differencing to stationarize the COVID-19 incidence time series and checked stationarity
using the augmented Dickey-Fuller test. The fitted ARIMAX model was used to forecast
cumulative incidence till the end of February based on migration data during the same period in
2019. The difference between the predicted and observed cumulative incidence is the estimated
intervention effect associated with the travel ban.

Statistical analyses were two-sided with type I error rate of 5%. We used R 3.6.1 for all
analyses.

RESULTS

Outbound traffic from Wuhan started to increase rapidly from January 13 and fell sharply after
January 23, 2020, when the travel ban was implemented (Figure 1A-1C). By January 23, 71%
of people who traveled out of Wuhan went to other cities in Hubei province and 29% migrated to
other provinces. The incidence of COVID-19 within and outside of Hubei province fluctuated in
similar patterns with the change in traffic (Figure 1E-1G), suggesting a lagged association
between traffic volume and COVID-19 incidence.

After prewhitening the COVID-19 incidence time series by the ARIMA model fitted on the
outbound traffic time series, we calculated the cross-correlation coefficients between daily
outbound traffic volume and COVID-19 incidence for each province. There were great
geographical variations in time lags and correlation coefficients (Figure 2A-2B). K-means
clustering analysis identified 3 latent clusters of provinces according to time lag and correlation
coefficients (Figure 2C). The estimated time lags between traffic volume and COVID-19
incidence were <1 week in 42% of provinces, 1 week in 39% of provinces, and 2-3 weeks in
19% of provinces.

We examined the potential contributors to provincial variations in the association between traffic
volume and COVID-19 incidence. The analyses showed that the time lags of the migration

effect were negatively associate with geographical distance (β= -4.9 per 1000 km, P=0.004;
Figure 3A) and positively with average daily traffic volume (β= 86.9 per unit, P=0.02; Figure 3B).
Correlation coefficients were positively associated with geographical distance (β=0.1 per 1000
km, P=0.03; Figure 3E) and negatively with GDP (β= -0.01 per 1000 USD/person, P=0.02;
Figure 3G). Population density was not associated with either the lag or correlation coefficient.
However, in sensitivity analyses excluding Shanghai from the analysis, whose population
density far exceeds all other provinces, population density was negatively associated with the
correlation coefficient (β= -0.15 per 1000 persons/sq.km, P=0.03).

The optimal ARIMAX models for each province cluster are summarized in Table 1. The ARIMA
(2,1,0) was optimal for provinces with <1 week of lag, and the ARIMA (1,1,0) was optimal for
provinces with ≥1 week of lag. The model-predicted cumulative incidence based on actual traffic
data demonstrated good fit with the observed incidences (Figure 4A-4C, Table 1). The predicted
cumulative incidences would be higher in all three clusters of provinces based on 2019 traffic
data (Figure 4D-4F), and the differences were projected to grow larger moving forward. It is
estimated that there would be approximately 2,123 more cases in provinces with <1 week lag,
4,363 more in provinces with 1 week of lag, and 13,282 more in provinces with 2-3 weeks of lag
by the end of February, although the predicted value was not significantly different from the
observed in provinces with <1 week of lag (Table 1). We estimated that the travel ban may have
reduced a total of 19,768 (95% CI: 13,589, 25,946) cases outside of Wuhan by the end of
February.

DISCUSSION

In this analysis, we examined the temporal relationship between outbound traffic from Wuhan
and the incidence of COVID-19 in 31 Chinese provinces. Our analyses suggest a positive timelagged association between human migration and the incidence of COVID-19. We identified 3
distinct clusters of provinces based on the timing and strength of associations: 42% of provinces
showed <1 week of lagged association, 39% with 1 week, and 19% with 2-3 weeks. Provinces
that are closer to Wuhan and have more passenger influx from Wuhan experienced a more
prolonged impact from migration. The correlations between traffic volume and COVID-19
incidence were weaker in economically advantaged provinces. Furthermore, we estimated that

Outbound traffic from Wuhan and COVID-19 incidence
the travel ban for Wuhan may have prevented approximately 19,768 COVID-19 cases (95% CI:
13,589, 25,946) outside of Wuhan by the end of February. This is equivalent to a 39% reduction
in expected cumulative incidence, suggesting that transportation control is an effective
intervention to contain the COVID-19 outbreak in the absence of cure and immunization.

Regional variations in the association between outflowing traffic from Wuhan and COVID-19
incidence worth closer examination. Longer time lag between traffic volume and COVID-19
incidence was observed in provinces closer to Wuhan or with more population influx from
Wuhan, such as Henan, Jiangxi, Shanghai, Guizhou, Guangdong, and Sichuan. Longer lagged
effect does not mean these provinces were less responsive to imported cases. Rather, it means
the overall changes in cumulative incidence in these provinces were not only driven by imported
cases but also infected cases through local transmissions. For example, the lag was estimated
to be 23 days for Henan province, which was severely affected by COVID-19. Although Henan
province was among the earliest to implement traffic control, the COVID-19 incidences grew
steadily after the traffic control. It is possible that the influx of Wuhan emigrants, mostly people
who returned home from work/school, led to significant local transmissions in Henan, which
outweighed the imported cases in driving the cumulative incidence to grow for a prolonged
period. Given the median incubation period of 4-6 days for COVID-19 [11], the overall COVID19 incidence in provinces with lags of 2-3 weeks, or approximately 2-3 times the median
incubation period, could be reflective of the second- or third-generation transmissions. Also,
provinces with longer lag tend to have higher cumulative incidence, suggesting widespread local
transmissions.

Another possible reason for the prolonged impact of migration in provinces adjacent to Hubei is
that cross-province migrations are hard to shut off given the geographical proximity. Sporadic
travelers from Wuhan may continue to cross provincial borders and spread the virus for a while
after the travel ban. This is evident by the fact that the lag was much shorter in provinces further
away from Wuhan (e.g., Tibet, Qinghai, Xinjiang, Hainan, Yunnan) or had more strict traffic
control (e.g., Beijing). Furthermore, travelers to these provinces were more likely to be tourists
as opposed to returning home; therefore, they have little social ties to the local population and
are less likely to introduce widespread local transmissions.

In addition, we found that the correlation between migration and COVID-19 incidence was lower
in provinces with higher GDP per capita. For example, the correlation coefficients were between

Outbound traffic from Wuhan and COVID-19 incidence
0.2-0.4 for Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Jiangsu, provinces with GDP per capita over $15,000
US dollars in 2019. In contrast, the correlation coefficients were between 0.5-0.7 for Gansu,
Guizhou, Heilongjiang, and Shanxi, provinces with GDP per capita below $7000 US dollars. The
finding suggests that provinces with better healthcare resources, greater disease prevention
efforts, and more mature infrastructure may have more capacity to manage disease outbreaks
and maintain faster responses as the outbreak evolve.

The primary strength of this analysis is the use of ARIMA models to examine the temporal
relationship between traffic and COVID-19 incidence, allowing us to disentangle the association
from a myriad of shared common trends between the two variables. The analysis is also novel
in that real-time, cellphone location-based migration data were used to measure population
mobility, which is superior to methods based on historical mobility data. This analysis also fitted
separate ARIMA models according to differing time-lagged impacts from traffic, leading to a
more accurate estimate of the intervention effect for the travel ban.

This analysis is subject to limitations. First, changes in diagnostic capacity and criteria for
COVID-19 may have contributed to, at least partly, the secular trend of COVID-19 incidence.
For example, there were underdiagnoses of COVID-19 during the early stage of the outbreak,
and later a surge in COVID-19 cases around February 13 due to broadened diagnostic criteria.
These changes were not travel-related and may distort the estimated association to some
extent. Second, the temporal association between traffic and COVID-19 could be confounded
by other preventive measures, such as increased self-quarantine and widespread use of face
mask and hand sanitization. Therefore, the estimated intervention effect associated with the
travel ban could be overestimated. Finally, as an ecologic study, our findings may suffer from
ecologic fallacy and do not necessarily imply individual-level association between travel history
and risk of COVID-19 infection.

In conclusion, mass migration out of Wuhan facilitated the COVID-19 outbreak in other parts of
China. The outflowing migration from Wuhan had a more prolonged impact on provinces that
are closer to Wuhan and have more immigration from Wuhan. Provinces with higher GDP per
capita were less impacted by migration. It is estimated that approximately 39% of cases outside
of Wuhan have been prevented by the travel ban issued on January 23, 2020. In the absence of
cures and immunization for an emerging infectious disease like COVID-19, transportation
control, an old-fashioned approach, is proven an effective public health intervention. Our

Figure 4. Predicted cumulative incidence of COVID-19 based on actual and historical traffic data.
Fig. 4A-4C show that the predicted incidence were well fitted with observed data. Red dots are predicted
incidence based on actual traffic data in 2020, and the black lines are observed incidence. Fig. 4D-4F
show that the cumulative incidences were projected to increase had the travel ban not been
implemented. The blue lines are predicted incidence based on historical travel data for the same Lunar
calendar period in 2019, and the black lines are the observed incidence.
