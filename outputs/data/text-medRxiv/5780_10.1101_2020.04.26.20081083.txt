Abstract

Background: After more than four months into the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic,
over 347,500 people had died worldwide. The current study aims to evaluate how mitigating
interventions affected the epidemic process in the 30 largest metropolitan areas in the US and
whether temperature played a role in the epidemic process.
Methods: Publicly available data for the time series of COVID-19 cases and deaths and weather
were analyzed at the metropolitan level. The time-varying reproductive numbers (Rt) based on
retrospective moving average were used to explore the trends. Student t tests were used to
compare temperature and peak Rt cross-sectionally.
Results: We found that virus transmissibility, measured by instantaneous reproduction number
(Rt), had declined since the end of March for all areas and almost all of them reached a Rt of 1 or
below after April 15, 2020. However, the Rts remained around 1 for most areas since then and
some small and short rebounds were presented in some areas, suggesting a persistent epidemic in
those areas. The timing of the main decline was concurrent with the implementation of
mitigating interventions. Cities with warm temperature also tended to have a lower peak Rt than
that of cities with cold temperature. However, large geographic variations existed.
Conclusions: Aggressive interventions might have mitigated the current epidemic of COVID-19,
while temperature might have some weak effects on the virus transmission. We may need to
prepare for a possible return of the coronavirus outbreak.

Introduction
The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the novel severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS) associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV2) infection [1] has not only affected more
than 5.5 million people and caused over 347,500 deaths worldwide
(https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html, accessed May 26, 2020), but also induced significant
anxiety among the public [2]. Many people raised concerns about whether the stringent
interventions were over-reacted, and whether a second wave of outbreak was possible. In the
2003 SARS epidemic, the virus went away after June 2003 and never came back[3]. Will this
happen to SARS-CoV2?
There are several major differences between 2003 SARS coronavirus and 2019 SARS CoV2 [3,
4]. The 2003 coronavirus had much higher virulence, resulting in higher hospitalizations and
mortality rates than the 2019 coronavirus. The transmission of the 2003 coronavirus almost
exclusively occurred among symptomatic cases[5], while the 2019 coronavirus can cause a large
percent of asymptomatic cases who can also transmit virus [6, 7]. Furthermore, the 2019
coronavirus is also circulating in the southern hemisphere where the current temperature is
warmer than that of northern hemisphere. By late 2020, it is possible the coronavirus may
circulate back to the northern hemisphere, leading to a second wave of epidemic[8]. Therefore, it
is important to empirically evaluate the effects of mitigating interventions and examine whether
temperature may affect the virus transmissibility and virulence.
One key measure of virus transmissibility during an epidemic is effective reproduction number
(R), the average number of secondary cases infected by a primary case [9-11]. Based on the
susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) model, the reproduction number can be conceptualized as
(number of contacts)*(infectivity per contact)*(generation interval), where generation interval

refers to the average duration between the time when a primary case becoming infectious and the
time when secondary cases being infected[10]. Clearly, interventions such as social distancing,
stay-at-home rule, school or office closures, and prohibiting large gatherings will reduce the
number of contacts, thus reducing R. On the other hand, a lower virus infectivity can also reduce
R, assuming the number of contacts remains unchanged. Therefore, exploring the changes of R
over time and across different regions can shed new lights on the impact of interventions and
environmental factors during the epidemic.
A few studies have used time varying Rt to explore the effects of intervention on the epidemic
process[12-16]. For example, one recent study found significant effects of nonpharmaceutical
interventions on the transmissibility of SARS-CoV2, measured by Rt, in Hongkong[16].
However, few studies examined the impact of environmental factors on the COVID-19 epidemic.
A few unpublished manuscripts have examined the association between temperature and
COVID-19 case counts and found no or a negative but weak association[17-19]. However, their
studies were based on case counts among different countries, which subjected to myriads of
confounding effects due to different diagnostic criteria, availability of detection kits and
reporting biases.
In this study, we will compare the magnitude and changes of time-varying (instantaneous)
effective reproduction numbers (Rt) among 30 largest metropolitan areas in the US. We
hypothesize that stringent interventions are effective in curbing the epidemic, but temperature
may also facilitate the decline of the epidemic in some regions.

We obtained daily COVID-19 cases and deaths at the US county level from the data repository
provided by New York Times (https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data, accessed on May
26,2020). We further limited those counties to the 30 largest metropolitan areas (Table 1). All
cases and deaths were summarized at the metropolitan level. The sizes of total population and
people aged 65 or above for each metropolitan area were obtained from census bureau website.
Information about stay-at-home rule for each state was scraped from popular news media. The
historical daily average temperature was obtained from national climate data online
(https://www7.ncdc.noaa.gov/CDO), mostly based on temperature collected from stations at each
metropolitan’s main airport.
Reproduction number and serial interval
The time varying reproduction number (Rt) was proposed by Cori A. et al. [11, 20]. This
approach assumes the occurrence of secondary cases follows a Poisson distribution, conditioning
on the time position in the whole infectious period of the primary case. The overall Rt at time t of
the epidemic is the average number of secondary cases for all prior infected cases who are still
infectious at a time window (t-s, t). The estimate is based on current secondary cases, not the
future infections. Therefore, it can be viewed as instantaneous Rt. To smooth the estimates, a
weighted average of Rt over a sliding window is used (e.g., one week window). Consequently,
we used a 7-day moving average of prior temperature when assessing the association between Rt
and temperature.
The estimation of Rt also depends on the estimation of virus infectivity profile that is
approximated from the distribution of generation interval. Since it is difficult to accurately
estimate the generation interval, serial interval is often used in calculating Rt [11]. The serial
interval refers to the average duration between symptom onset of a primary case and symptom

onset of secondary cases. In this study, we assumed the serial interval had a gamma distribution
with mean=4.7 days and standard deviation = 2.9 days [21, 22], similar to that of recent
studies[15]. This serial interval was applied to all regions throughout the whole study period to
ensure the compatibility of Rt across regions. However, different regions at different time might
have different serial intervals due to interventions and other environmental and social factors.
We also performed sensitivity analysis with a shorter serial interval (mean = 3.95, standard
deviation=4.75 [23] and a longer interval (mean = 7.5, standard deviation = 3.4) [4]. The patterns
of Rt were similar, except for different estimated Rt values (average peak Rt 1-4 for shorter
duration, and 2-9 for longer duration).
Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics and bivariate associations were reported. Student t-tests were used for
comparisons. The sizes of total population and people aged 65 or older, and the percent of
positive tests at each date were used for adjustment. R package EpiEstim was used [11] to
estimate the instantaneous reproduction numbers over time. The association between temperature
and Rt was explored cross-sectionally at the peak of Rt and also at some arbitral dates.
We adopted two time scales in the analysis. The first was calendar date to present the trends of
reproduction numbers for all metropolitan areas, starting from the date with at least 10 total
reported cases. Staggered entrances into the outbreak were preserved. The second scale was the
time since the beginning of the outbreak, regardless what calendar date the outbreak happened.
This was to compare the declining patterns of Rt across metropolitan areas. We also realigned the
time scale from the peak of the outbreak. The first two weeks of Rt estimates were excluded, as
the first week Rt were zeros, and the second week estimates were too variable due to small
number of cases.

P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. However, there were many
statistical comparisons involved. Although we did not adjust for multiple comparisons, we were
cautious about over interpretations and conducted statistical tests only between prior selected
pairs (e.g., southern versus northern metropolitan areas).
Ethics statement
In this study, the author has no financial and conflict of interest to disclose. The ethics approval
was exempted for this study, as no human subjects were involved, and all data were publicly
available. The statistical codes and data will be available online (https://tinyurl.com/ybhdcjqu).
Results
The basic characteristics of metropolitan areas were presented in Table 1. All metropolitan areas
had at least 1.5 million people in 2019 and over 1,000 confirmed cases. As of May 25, 2020, the
reported case-fatality rates varied from 1.28 per 100 cases in Salt Lake City, UT to 11.65 per 100
cases in Detroit, MI. However, since there were large variations in case ascertainment criteria
and availability of detection kits among different regions, comparing case-fatality rates was
unreliable. Meanwhile, since about 80% of deaths occurred among elderly people[24], we
compared the ratios of deaths to the size of elderly population among metropolitan areas. The
ratios were generally lower in areas with warm weather (mean 0.09, range 0.02- to 0.22 per 100
elderly), and higher in areas with cold temperature (mean: 0.24, range 0.05 to 0.63 per 100
elderly) (p for difference = 0.007).
The trends of Rt for 30 metropolitan areas were shown in Figure 1a-1d, grouped by geographic
locations and temperature conditions. Overall, the instantaneous Rts in all areas reached peaks or
some stable points after two to three weeks, decreased significantly since the end of March, and

most areas reached a Rt of 1 or less after April 15. However, some small and short rebounds
were presented in some areas. This might be due to case reporting and detection issues, but could
also indicate some true rebounds. In addition, the Rts remained around 1 for most areas,
suggesting a persistent epidemic in those areas. It is of note that around the week of March 25,
many schools were closed and many companies started offering employees working from home.
The US government has issued COVID-19 coping guideline to all US citizens, and many states
also issued stay-at-home rules (see Appendix Table 1).
Figure 1a compared Rt trends between typical northeastern cities and southern cities. Boston,
Chicago, New York and Philadelphia started the epidemic earlier, had higher peak Rts than that
of Miami, Orlando, Houston, and Los Angeles. After some initial increases (though peaked at
different dates), all northern cities declined sharply after the mid-March. In addition, the
trajectories of Houston and Los Angeles were similar with initial peaks at around March 18,
somewhat decreased and then were stable around March 25. For Miami and Orland, the Rts were
quite stable during the week of March 25, and declined sharply after about March 28. However,
the slopes of decline, when aligned by the time since the peak Rt, were similar except a few
spikes in Houston and Los Angeles (Appendix Figure 1a).
On the other hand, the Rt curves were indistinguishable between upper midwestern cities and
other southern cities (Figure 1b). Upper midwestern cities except Pittsburg all had earlier
interventions in the mid-March (Appendix Table 1 for dates stay-at-home rules issued), while
Minneapolis-St. Paul area had some rebounds over the course of epidemic. In addition, the west
coastal cities had an early start of the epidemic, and Rt curves were less volatile than that of other
cities during the study period (Figure 1c). The unusually high Rt in Salt Lake City in the early
epidemic may be due to a small number of cases during that period (Figure 1d).

Furthermore, after realigning the starting time from their respective outbreak peaks for all
metropolitan areas, the overall declining patterns were similar across all regions (Appendix
Figure 1a-d).
To evaluate the association between Rt and temperature across regions, we compared the highest
Rt (occurred after the first two weeks) among them (Figure 2), most cities had a peak Rt between
1 and 5. At the low temperature, peak Rts varied significantly. Cities with cold average
temperature generally had higher Rts than those with warm temperature. However, upper
midwestern cities such as Minneapolis-St. Paul, Milwaukee, and Columbus had much lower
peak Rts than the rest of cities. The average peak of Rts in Boston, Chicago, New York, and
Philadelphia were marginally (but not statistically significant) higher than that of Houston, Los
Angeles, Orlando and Miami (average peak Rt 4.01 vs. 3.15, p = 0.07). In addition, we also
arbitrarily examined the Rt patterns on the 15th day after the outbreak and on March 24, 2020
when most interventions had not fully executed (Appendix Figure 2a and 2b). These crosssectional analyses demonstrated similar patterns to that of peak Rt.
Discussion
Overall, since the end of March, the instantaneous reproduction number (Rt) declined over time
similarly in 30 largest metropolitan areas, and after April 15, Rts in almost all areas reached 1 or
below. Since then, the Rts remained around 1 in most areas and there were a few small and short
rebounds in some regions, suggesting the epidemic was persistent in those areas. The main
decline was concurrent with the implementation of aggressive interventions in the US,
suggesting stringent interventions were effective in halting the epidemic. However, there were
large geographic variations in the Rt patterns, partly due to different levels of interventions,
geographic altitudes, and partly might be due to temperature variations.

Without effective interventions, the peak of epidemic will reach higher and the epidemic process
will last longer [25]. Thus, the reproduction numbers will not decline until a large proportion of
susceptible people are infected. For example, during the week of March 25, Rts in Houston,
Miami, and Orlando were relatively stable (Figure 1a). After the end of March, due to national
efforts in mitigating the epidemic, all Rt curves started declining. The state of Florida, however,
did not officially issue the stay-at-home rule until April 3, 2020, where the curves already
declined significantly. This posed some difficulties in assessing the intervention effects precisely.
On the other hand, a few cities demonstrated some significant impact of interventions on
mitigating the epidemic. For example, some upper midwestern cities (e.g., Minneapolis-St. Paul
and Milwaukee) implemented interventions earlier, had lower peak Rts, and their Rts started
declining early, while cities like Pittsburg and Detroit had much higher Rt at the beginning, and
Rt declined later. Even for cities like Chicago and New York, the intervention effects were
evident based on the sharp decline of Rt since the mid-March, despite they had much higher Rts
in the beginning of epidemic.
It has been suggested that like many other respiratory virus infections, a seasonal pattern may
exist for SARS like coronavirus [26, 27]. However, as demonstrated in this study, the association
between reproduction number and temperature was deeply confounded by interventions and
other external factors (including altitudes and humidity). In this study, we found the peak Rts in
warm cities were moderately lower on average than those in cold cities, suggesting that the virus
transmissibility might be lower in warm temperature than cold temperature.
However, our analysis warned readers about interpreting selective findings. For emerging
epidemic like COVID-19, many things were happening simultaneously. Effective interventions
such as travelling restriction, social distancing and stay-at-home rules will change the epidemic

process [25, 28, 29]. The availability of testing, diverse case ascertainment criteria, the delay of
diagnosis and case isolation, incomplete contact tracing, the percent of asymptomatic cases, and
the infectivity of pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic cases will profoundly affect our ability to
understand the epidemic. In this study, we observed some small but possible negative association
between temperature and virus transmissibility (Figure 1a and 2). However, there were large
variations in the peak Rts among regions with lower temperature, partly due to different
intervention effects and also might be due to cultural and social differences. It is also likely that
other environmental factors such as living conditions may affect virus transmission. For example,
under cold weather, most people will stay indoors and have close and more frequent contacts
with other people. The indoor environment such as air conditioning may be conducive for virus
transmission.
Furthermore, the concurrent decline of Rt and increase of temperature over time are also
confounded by the epidemic process itself. As suggested before, a significant reduction of
susceptible people will lead to a decline of Rt. Longitudinally comparing the trend of Rt and
temperature is difficult if the epidemic evolves rapidly, as in the current COVID-19 epidemic.
For instance, from March to April, all the epidemic in the 30 metropolitan areas had a sharp
decline, while the temperature in the whole US was still amenable for virus transmission.
There were some limitations in our study. The most important limitation was the inability to
account for the diverse detection capacities across regions (Appendix Table 1). In regions with
lower detection capacity, not only were there fewer cases detected (especially missing those with
no or mild symptoms), but also the eligibilities for detection were more stringent. Only those
with symptoms might be offered for virus detection. Thus, a sudden increase in case counts
might not be due to an actual increase of infected people, rather it reflected the increased

availability of detection kits. This was the main reason we had highly variable estimates of Rt in
the beginning of epidemic, and also some small rebounds in some areas after April 15.
Additionally, with more detection kits available, we will observe more asymptomatic or mild
symptomatic cases. Our methods assumed the same virus infectivity between symptomatic and
asymptomatic cases, which was likely not true.
Methodologically, our estimation of Rt relied on many assumptions. Rt is determined by both the
growth rate of new cases and the distribution of generation interval or serial interval [10]. We
assumed a universal distribution of serial interval for all regions and over the whole time period.
Serial interval may change due to interventions, regional characteristics, and the stage of
epidemic. More stringent interventions and stay-at-home rules may result in shorter serial
interval because the transmission will likely occur inside the households.
We were not able to rigorously evaluate the virulence of SARS -CoV 2. Although we briefly
compared death rates across regions, due to large and unknown delays between virus infection
and deaths in the US, most deaths would be diagnosed several weeks before. There was also a
delay in death certifications. Additionally, most died cases were elderly people or those with
existing chronic conditions. Therefore, assessing the virulence should untangle the confounding
effects by health care resource capacities, evolving treatments, and patient’s characteristics. A
possible measure of virulence is the pattern of hospitalizations, as they are less likely affected by
the availability of detection. After more hospitalization data are available and more
asymptomatic and mild symptomatic cases are diagnosed, future research should focus on the
impact of epidemic on the severity of disease and health care resource uses instead of the
magnitude of epidemic.

In addition, as mentioned before, secondary data analysis based on existing aggregated data
suffer many types of unmeasured confounding. Our data were collected by journalists which
might lack scientific rigor. However, as stated in the New York Times data website, data were
scraped from data portal such as those John Hopkins University COVID-19 data portal, state
COVID-19 portal and various press conferences, and verified against each State Health
Department. Nonetheless, although the quality of New York Times data was considered
acceptable, the data were hastily collected and little validation was done. Biased data might lead
to biased conclusions and wrong governmental decisions. We should call for replicated analysis
based on more rigorously collected and validated data. Thus, our analyses were mostly
descriptive and deliberately avoided over-interpretations through numerous comparisons
between regions. A careful exploration of validated individual level data may shed some lights
on these issues.
Finally, our study has some unique strengths. First, we focus on large metropolitan areas to
ensure enough cases and to have comparable societal structure, individual behaviors and health
care resources. Certainly, epidemic in non-metropolitan areas should also be studied and may
have unique patterns different from that of metropolitan areas. Epidemic in rural areas was of
particular concern recently as rural areas often had limited health care resources to cope with the
epidemic. Second, we explored the changes of effective reproduction number (Rt) over time and
across regions to understand the impact of interventions and temperature on virus transmissibility.
We presented and compared all regions to avoid selective reporting bias. To study the
association between temperature and the epidemic process, we focus on the comparisons of Rt at
the peak of outbreak and before interventions, presumably less confounded by interventions and
other factors.

In summary, we observed a large decline of instantaneous reproduction numbers over time
during the COVID-19 epidemic in 30 US metropolitan areas, the timing of which was concurrent
with the implementation of mitigating interventions. Given that the whole population were naïve
in immunity against this virus, it was likely the epidemic might last longer and more severe
without interventions[25]. In addition, there was a possible weak negative association between
instantaneous reproduction number and temperature. However, whether this predicts the
coronavirus will disappear in the summer and never come back, like that of 2003 SARS
coronavirus, is hard to tell. Given that the Rts remained around 1 for most areas since later April
and the virus is circulating in both northern and southern hemisphere, we need to be vigilant
about a possible second wave of outbreak later of the year.
