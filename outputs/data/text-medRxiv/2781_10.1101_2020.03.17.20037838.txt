AAEDM*: Theoretical Dynamic Epidemic Diffusion Model
and Covid-19 Korea Pandemic Cases
AMANG (SONG-KYOO) KIM
ABSTRACT
This paper deals with an advanced analytical epidemic diffusion model
which is capable to predict the status of epidemic impacts. This newly
propose model well describes an epidemic growth and it could be widely
applied into various topics including pathology, epidemiology, business and
data sciences. The Advanced Analytical Epidemic Diffusion Model
(AAEDM) is a dynamic diffusion prediction model which is theoretically
intuitive and its tractable closed formula could be easily adapted into
versatile Bigdata driven analytics including the machine learning system.
This dynamic model is still an analytical model but the periods of prediction
are segmented for adapting the values from the dataset when the data is
available. The epidemiologically vital parameters which effect on the
AAEDM are also introduced in this paper. The evaluation of this theoretical
model based on the Covid-19 data in Korea has been accomplished with
relative fair future prediction accuracies. Although this analytical model has
been designed from a basic exponential growth model, the performance of
the AAEDM is competitive with other Bigdata based simulation models.
Since the AAEDM is relatively simple and handy, anyone can use this model
into analyzing outbreak situations in his daily life.

1. INTRODUCTION
As of March 12th, 2020, the WHO (World Health Organization) announced that the
Coronavirus (aka. Covid-19) was deeply confirmed as a pandemic [1] which is the 3rd
announcement of the pandemic by WHO since 1948 [2]. A pandemic is a disease that
is spreading in multiple countries around the world at the same time [1]. The same
news has been announced in several Korean newspapers and TVs [2]. On the next
day, Korea had reached more than 8,000 persons are infected by the Corona virus [3].
It has been panicking in Korea and still Koreans have panicked. Politicians have
started to appeal their opinions about the Covid-19 pandemic for the election on this
year. News medias also have been involved to appeal their political opinions even
based on scientifically fake information. Many professionals in the field of
Epidemiology keep talking about the Covid-19 pandemic issues and strongly insisted

their opinions to appeal their existence. Many people who do not have related
knowledge could only trust what epidemiologists have said [4-5]. Although
professionals have provided historical (scientific) facts which they might learn from
the textbook or statistical data, there are a lot of conflictions even within their
documented scientific facts. Many data scientists are working for delivering the
valuable insights from the Covid-19 data [3, 6-7] but most of them are spending their
efforts for gathering and visualizing data rather than doing theoretical studies to build
up a model which could describe the Covid-19 pandemic situations. Basically, the
area of Epidemiology is too complicated to provide solid solution based historical
facts without having theoretical thinking at the beginning.
In the other hand, a virus epidemic is atypical textbook example of an exponential
growth [9]. An exponential growth model insanely fits well in diffusion (or growth)
problems including virus generating systems if the proper parameters are pre-defined
at the beginning. But the main problem is that these parameters keeps changing in
real-world problems like Covid-19 epidemic cases. The AAEDM (Advanced
Analytical Epidemic Diffusion Model) is a dynamic diffusion prediction model which
is still a theoretical model but the periods of prediction are segmented for adapting the
values from the dataset when the data is available. Additionally, two critical
parameters are suggested to build this new prediction model. These two parameters
have been opted by most of data scientists and epidemiologists. These factors become
vital parameters which could impact on the future prediction of a epidemic and give
the clear cut to understand the current pandemic situation well.
This article consists of six sections. Section 2 describes the AAEDM which is an
enhanced mathematical epidemic diffusion model to predict the number of infected
people by typical epidemics. It also introduces the kappa and zeta factors which are
capable to determine the characteristics of this prediction model. These factors could
be used for understanding the current Covid-19 pandemic situations without analyzing
heavy amount of dataset which only available for related professionals. Section 3
provides for data scientists or data analysts who want adapt the AAEDM into their
statistical systems or the machine learning systems. There are couple of examples to
simplify for gathering data and they could freely modify based on their circumstances
with only one solid condition. Section 4 discusses the testing and validation of the
AAEDM by using the dataset from the Covid-19 statistics in Korea. Although the
AAEDM is a simple and handy model, the performance (mainly, an accuracy of future
predictions) is fairly acceptable to be used for a statistical model by using Bigdata.
Finally, the conclusion and further discussion regarding this research are provided in
Section 5 and 6.

2. ENHANCED MATHMATICAL EPIDEMIC DIFFUSION MODEL
A conventional mathematical diffusion model is based on an exponential growth
function which has been widely used on the fluid mechanics and thermal dynamic
physics. The growth of virus epidemic is a textbook example of this kind of growth
[9] and atypical expression is as follows [9]:

2.3. Kappa and Zeta: Cure and Net Increase Factors
This paper proposed two important factors which determine the characteristics of the
AAEDM based prediction. The first parameter is the cure factor (aka. kappa-factor, factor) which is already shown from (2.5). The kappa-factor is an (daily) increase ratio
between the net increase of cured people and the net increase of infected people (see
Figure 1).

Figure 1. 3D graph for the cure factor 
From (2.5) and (2.7)-(2.8), the factor impacts on the total number of infected cases.
Based on an empirical hunch, the critical threshold of the kappa-factor is 0.5 which
indicates the speed of curing is more than a half of net epidemic increasing. As shown
in Figure 2, the net increasing of spreading viruses is dramatically dropped when the
kappa-factor is greater than 0.5 (i.e.,   ) The current cure factor in Korea is
around 0.09 as of March 14th, 2020.

Another critical parameter of the AAEDM is the net increase ratio factor which is
called as zeta-factor ( -factor). The zeta-factor indicates an average value of the
increasing ratio between the present and the past (see Figure 3).

Figure 3. 3D graph for the net increasing factor 
The -factor  gives a good indication of a current status of epidemic growth.
   means the epidemic will be exponentially increased during a next prediction
period (      ). In the other hand,    means that the growth will start
saturating in the next prediction period. It is noted that the number of growth still will
be increased even in the case of   . If  is closed to 1 (i. e.,   1), the
growth tends to be linear.

2.3. Developing the future prediction model
Let us assume that  is the predicted accummulated number of infected people on a
given day      in the prediction cycle . The typical value of  is 1 which
means that the collected dataset has been applied just before a future prediction. The
prediction model for the next cycle (i.e.,   ) could be dveloped from (2.10) as
follows:

where

2.11
2.12

The actual data of the end of observation (or training, analysis) period becomes an
initial value of a prediction model. The AAEDM is designed to adjust the initial
conditions based on the recent updated actual data in every observation cycle
whenever actual data are available during a previous prediction period:

Hence, the model tends to be really accurate when the observation cycle is minimum
(i.e.,   ) and this special model will be treated in Section 4.1. Similarly, the
predicted number of net-increasing of infected people could be determined as follows:

3. PARAMETER APPROXIMATIONS FOR STATISTICAL LEARNING
Although many researchers are dealing with huge amount dataset and bring nice and
fancy visualization based on these data [10-11] but the dataset of the kappa-factor and
the zeta-factor may not fully available because these factors have been lightly dealt by
data scientist. If users want to use this new theoretical prediction model, these
parameters should be gathered from originally available dataset. This section provides
the certain methods to simplify these two parameters.
3.1. Approximation of the parameters
The AAEDM has been designed for statistical analysis under extremely limited
available datasets. Therefore, these two parameters (-factor &  -factor) could be
alternative obtained even the values are not calculated from the original formula.
There are a lot of alternative approximation approaches regarding these parameters
and one of typical approaches are as follows:

3.2

These parameters could be used for prediction models to estimate the number of
accumulated infected people (2.10) and the net increasing (2.13). It is noted that these
parameters are flexible enough to be modified based on data availability. Dataset
might contain only recent values for these two parameters which might be missed at
the beginning (e. g., missing of  and  ). The values could be determined in
different calculations such as:

3.4

 

 

The way of modifying these two factors depends on various conditions from
researchers. As long as the rationales of these parameters are same, researchers could
modify these parameters as much as they want. The kappa-factor and zeta-factor
could be even more simplified as follows:




3.5



 1

3.6

  
  

The method of calculating these two factors could be mixed and matched. For instant,
a data analyst could determine  from (3.1) and  from (3.4) instead of using the
original forms from (2.5)-(2.6). Other scientists might differently calculate these
factors from (3.1) and (2.7). The optimal values of these factors could be determined
by currently available datasets. The methods for determining these factors are freely
chosen except for one condition: Consistencies. It means that the formula for
calculating  and  factors should be the same for both observing (or training)
presents and predicting futures. If the factors are calculated in a certain way at the
beginning, the same way of calculation should be applied into predicting the future.
The data analysis for the proof of the AAEDM chooses the -factor from (3.5) and  factor from (2.7).

4. KOREA COVID-19 PANDEMIC CASE STUDIES
The dataset for Korea case has been collected from various sources [3, 6-8] for
developing the statistical testing but all data have used the same original source from
the Korean government [8]. The data have been collected as daily basis since February
21, 2020 until March 14th, 2020. Since, the data are scattered as daily reporting
documents, the actual values are manually collected. Fortunately, it does not require
heavy amount of this data because the purpose of data collection is for the AAEDM

demonstration. It is noted that the data collection from the government is confused
because they change the way of delivering numbers. During the data collection period,
they started counting the total number of infected people without adding the number
of cured people. The total number of infected people had been counted including the
number of cured in the past. The values in the dataset has been revised by adding the
number of cured people after certain period of time.
4.1. Minimum observation period
Since the model deals with the ratio, it requires to observe at least two measure from
the actual dataset. From (2.10) and (2.12)-(2.13), the AAEDM is simplified as
follows:

As shown in Figure 4, the results are fairly accurate (see Figure 4) because the initial
values for prediction have been measured everyday but it could predict only one day
after. It is noted that this special AAEDM is capable to predicts an accurate future
with only three values which everyone could find exact estimation even from news
media [3, 6-7] or from the government reports [8]. The accuracy of this AADEM is
more than 90 % (  0.9175).

The calculation by using the AAEDM is straight forward and the predicted value
could be estimated from (2.10). The 10 days (actually 11; 0,1, ,10) during the
observation period (02.21-03.02) is selected for the observation (i.e., a training phase

in a machine learning system). All important parameters including the  and  could
be calculated by using the data during this period.

Figure 5. Comparison result with the real data during the observation
The comparison result is shown in Figure 5 and the accuracy of the theoretical model
is 0.8676 (  87 %) which is not that bad to get the expected values directly from
theoretical formula. The future prediction starts at the end of the observation period
and the parameters are adjusted based on the real data. The period of the prediction is
the next 10 days from March 2nd to 12th. The predicted values have been compared
with the actual data after passing 10 days and the accuracy is around 83% (see Figure
6).

5. CONCLUSIONS
Korea is still under suffering of the Covid-19 pandemic and many peoples who live in
Korea are still on panic Many news and social medias have produced the related news
and comments based on unscientific facts. Even documented scientific facts bring a
lot of confusion because of conflicted facts by their own. The purpose of this paper is
removing these confusions by understanding the basics of nature. The way of
understanding the Covid-19 epidemic status is just checking two factors in daily basis.
It will give the fairly accurate status of the epidemic. As of today, the value of kappafactor is around 0.08 and the value of zeta-factor is 1.14 and the accumulated number
of infected people might be increased up to 12,000 at the end of March. News and
social medias should not be fully trusted because they will say whatever they want
people to believe. The world including Korea will be eventually settled and safe from
the Covid-19 pandemic when the kappa-factor is greater than 0.5 and the zeta-factor
is lower than 1 (i.e.,      ). That is what the AAEDM talks today.

6. FUTURE DIRECTIONS
This section is the list of future research which researchers might be interested into
adapting or initiating their research projects.
Adapting the AAEDM into other countries and other regions: Although the AADEM
has been adapted for proofing the concept in Korea case, it could be adapted into
other countries or other regions such as Italy, USA, UK, UAE and so on. They will
understand the Covid-19 situation more clearly by tracking the kappa and the zeta
factors.
Improving the AAEDM: The closed formula of the AAEDM is still in the basic stage.
Other vital factors such as social distancing [12] could be added and evaluated with
real epidemic data.
Optimizing the critical parameters in the AAEDM: Researchers could find the critical
parameters in the AAEDM including ,  and  by using the machine learning (ML)
techniques.
Finding the analytical function of  and  : In the AAEDM, the  and  factors
are determined as a constant value most based on empirical hunch. But the author
strongly believes that  and   are time dependent stochastic functions. It
could not be easily found analytically but the ML technique could build up the
functions based on massive data analytics.
Finding the impacts of kappa and zeta factors: Although these two parameters are
epidemiologically important and key elements of the AAEDM formula, these factors
are coming to the picture by empirical hunch and it is not statistically proven yet.
Researchers might be interested in finding statistical relationships (i.e., correlation,
p-value, hypothesis testing and so on) between the epidemic growth and these two
parameters based on massive amount of data analytics.

Experiment practices for SETM kids: Practicing scientific experiments is one of
important activities for STEM kids. As it might be noticed, the basic model of the
AAEDM is simple and handy. Everyone who knows about an exponential growth can
easily understand the AAEDM for their scientific experiments.
All topics above are only small parts of the potential research topics based on the
AAEDM and researchers may feel free to use the AAEDM for their own purposes as
long as this paper is properly citied.
