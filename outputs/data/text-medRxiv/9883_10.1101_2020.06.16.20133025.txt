Abstract
Background: Detecting antibody responses during and after SARS-CoV-2 infection is essential in
determining the seroepidemiology of the virus and the potential role of antibody in disease. Scalable,
sensitive and specific serological assays are essential to this process. The detection of antibody in
hospitalized patients with severe disease has proven straightforward; detecting responses in subjects
with mild disease and asymptomatic infections has proven less reliable. We hypothesized that the
suboptimal sensitivity of antibody assays and the compartmentalization of the antibody response may
contribute to this effect.
Methods: We systemically developed an ELISA assay, optimising different antigens and amplification
steps, in serum and saliva from symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2-infected subjects.
Results: Using trimeric spike glycoprotein, rather than nucleocapsid enabled detection of responses in
individuals with low antibody responses. IgG1 and IgG3 predominate to both antigens, but more antispike IgG1 than IgG3 was detectable. All antigens were effective for detecting responses in
hospitalized patients. Anti-spike, but not nucleocapsid, IgG, IgA and IgM antibody responses were
readily detectable in saliva from non-hospitalized symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. Antibody
responses in saliva and serum were largely independent of each other and symptom reporting.
Conclusions. Detecting antibody responses in both saliva and serum is optimal for determining virus
exposure and understanding immune responses after SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Introduction
COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has resulted in millions of cases and more than 400,000 deaths
around the world 1. Detection of active infection is routinely achieved by testing for viral RNA, but this
approach cannot be used once symptoms have resolved. Antibody testing is useful to determine
historic exposure to the virus, may provide insight into the immunological status of the individual and
could be a measure of protection against re-infection.
The development of novel antibody tests requires a comprehensive understanding of the humoral
response to a specific pathogen across the spectrum of disease caused by that pathogen. An
important factor is the variable clinical presentation of infection that can influence the concentration of
antibody induced within a subject. Understanding antibody responses in individuals with the lowest
symptomatology will be of major importance for monitoring viral transmission within this SARS-CoV-2
pandemic 2. We have previously reported that asymptomatic seroconversion associates with lower
levels of antibody to viral spike protein, which may complicate discriminating between
asymptomatically infected individuals and those who were never infected3. Antigen choice and purity
are other elements that can influence performance of the assay, not least by detecting cross-reactive
antibodies induced by previous infection to other coronaviruses4. Therefore, the development of
assays to detect low levels of anti-viral antibodies need to consider multiple variables in order to be of
use in seroepidemiological studies.
Understanding the relationship between the varied clinical presentations of COVID-19 and the
serological response that arises during and following infection will be of major significance in
understanding the immunopathogenesis of disease and selecting appropriate treatments. This
includes the degree of antigen recognition and the antibody subclasses involved. Little is known about
the role of different antibody subclasses offering protection versus driving immunopathology in
COVID-19. For instance, antibodies such as IgM, and the IgG subclasses IgG1 and IgG3 are efficient
at activating complement, whereas IgA and IgG2 are not 5.
Most pathogens that enter via mucosal surfaces can induce immune responses within the mucosa and
associated secondary lymphoid organs as well as systemic immunity in distant lymphoid organs, like
the spleen. Systemic and mucosal immune responses can share significant overlap, yet the two
immune systems are semi-autonomous. A clear example demonstrating the segregation of antibodies
in the blood and mucosal compartments is the finding that in multiple myeloma patients, the
monoclonal antibody and free light chains secreted by the malignant plasma cells is clearly detected in
blood but not in saliva (unpublished observations). Nevertheless, other studies have shown that
mucosal immunity can drive systemic responses demonstrating that an inter-relationship often occurs

responses is not completely understood. Assessing and understanding this aspect is important as it
offers the opportunity to simplify testing through use of less invasive approaches, e.g. using saliva.
Undermining the ready use of tests that examine salivary antibody levels, is that levels against specific
pathogens can be a hundred to a thousand fold less than serum levels and thus fall under the level of
detection of assays employed8. Mucosal antibody studies may also provide insights into the nature of
post-infection protective immunity and help us understand the inter-relationship between systemic and
mucosal immunity to the virus, which has applications for vaccine programs.
In this study, we report on the use of an antibody assay to detect antibodies in subjects with lower
levels of SARS-CoV-2 specific-antibody. To do this, we examined responses to two well characterized
proteins - the surface-exposed spike (S) protein that is a target of neutralizing antibodies and the
nucleocapsid (N) protein, which is the most abundant viral protein. After identifying the optimal
approach to maximize the signal:noise ratio, we then determined the relationship between antibodies
in serum and saliva. This work will help accelerate the development of sensitive ELISA methods
available to researchers and also inform on short and long-term immunity.

Results
Hospitalized patients induce robust responses to multiple SARS-CoV-2 antigens
To identify the antibody response to the virus, we tested sera against a range of viral antigens. There
were three groups of subjects analyzed: Hospitalized subjects (HS, N=18), which included individuals
that were admitted to the hospital and had confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection by PCR; non-hospitalized
convalescent (NHC, N=39) subjects, who were patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection by PCR
but were not hospitalized; and asymptomatic non-hospitalized convalescent patients (AS, N=6), who
were individuals without reported symptoms who gave a positive result for SARS-CoV-2 infection by
PCR. As a negative control group, we used sera taken before 2019 (Pre-19, N=35). Further details
can be found in supplementary table I. Initial studies focused on the two major targets of antibody
responses: the viral S1 fragment and purified receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike (S) glycoprotein
and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. As expected, strong IgG, IgA and IgM responses were detected to
these proteins in all HS individuals with severe disease (Fig. 1). In contrast to the strong responses
observed in severe cases, IgG, IgA and IgM responses were observed in the NHC subjects, and in
some instances, responses were undetectable (Fig. 1B). At the first dilution there was some binding of
IgG in Pre19 sera to N. Area Under the Curve (AUC) calculations confirmed that the highest response
was observed in the group of HS for all the antigens tested (Fig. 1D). However, in AS and NHC,
responses were reduced by half for IgG and at least to a fifth for IgA and IgM (Fig. 1D). Despite the
lower antibody levels, IgG, IgA and IgM responses were detected in some asymptomatic individuals.
Thus, simple non-optimized ELISAs readily detect antibodies to spike, RBD and N protein in sera from
RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients.
Generation of soluble, native-like trimeric S glycoprotein
The use of RBD and S1 fragments within the assay was sufficient to detect antibodies in most
individuals. Nevertheless, we hypothesized that these subunits may result in sub-optimal detection of
antibodies in sera, particularly where titers were low, as these constructs both present intrinsically
lower number of native epitopes and, in the case of the RBD, additionally display non-native epitopes
hidden in the natively folded glycoprotein. Therefore, we produced soluble trimeric SARS-CoV-2 S
glycoprotein. We expressed and purified recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein containing the
previously described 2P-stabilized form, with a construct lacking the furin cleavage site, which
minimizes S1/S2 subunit shedding, and is trapped in the pre-fusion conformation 9. The purity of the
resultant SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein was confirmed by both SDS-PAGE (Figure 2A,B) and by mass
spectrometry (reported in detail elsewhere

10

). To ensure the SARS-CoV-2 was natively folded we

performed surface plasmon resonance (SPR) between the purified S glycoprotein and its cognate
receptor human angiotensin-converting enzyme (hACE2) (Figure 2C). We determined a KD of 84 nM

for hACE2 binding to SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein confirming the functionality of the purified
glycoprotein.
Native-like, trimeric S antigen is superior to N to detect Ab in sera at higher dilutions
We then assessed whether changing multiple parameters within the assay could enhance the
responses detected. By using the purified trimeric S glycoprotein we enhanced antibody detection
compared to S1 protein, both in terms of the absolute OD450 values and in terms of the signal:noise
ratio, and this was particularly notable as antibody became limiting (Fig. 2D,E). For example,
signal:noise ratio when S glycoprotein was used was above 10 and only dropped when the sera was
diluted to 1:4096. In contrast, signal:noise ratio for S1 remained lower than 10 at all dilutions tested.
Increasing the amount of S glycoprotein per well from 0.1 to 0.2 µg/well, modestly enhanced the anti-S
OD450 values (Fig. 2F), but overall provided no improvement of the signal:noise ratio (Fig. 2G).
Similarly, higher concentrations of N did improve signal detection but had little difference to the
signal:noise ratio, as background responses to control sera also increased (Fig. 2F,G). Thus, total
trimeric S glycoprotein provides better discrimination to identify infected from non-infected individuals
than S1 or N protein.
Antibody subclass distribution does not differ depending upon the severity of disease
We then investigated the type of antibody response in patients by identifying the IgG subclasses
generated against each antigen, and whether these responses varied to the different antigens. This
matters beyond the seroepidemiological detection of infection because heavy chain use influences the
effector function of antibodies. In HS and NHC, IgG1 and IgG3 were detected to S, RBD and N (Fig.
3A-C). However, AUC for IgG1 and IgG3 was lower in NHC compared to HS (Fig. 3D). IgG2 was
largely undetectable regardless of the antigen or the origin of the sera. However, some samples were
weakly positive for IgG4 to N but not S (Fig. 3C). The IgG1 response predominated against S or its
RBD component. Thus, severe and less severe SARS-CoV-2 infections result in similar IgG antibody
isotype switching profiles, although the extent of IgG1 and IgG3 isotype switching may differ between
antigens.
Combined detection of IgG, IgA and IgM enhances detection of antibody responses
The trimeric S glycoprotein was then used in the immunoassay to detect IgG, IgA and IgM in sera from
NHC. All antibody isotypes were detectable in the same individuals (Fig. 4A). As a significant need in
a test is to discriminate between infected individuals with low levels of antibody and non-infected
individuals, we assessed whether combining anti-IgG, IgA and IgM (anti-GAM) secondary antibodies
to detect all three isotypes could enhance signal detection. Merging secondary antibodies to detect

anti-GAM responses provided a signal at each dilution that reflected the strongest signal from each of
the three individual isotypes (Fig. 4A).
We examined if the IgG, IgA, IgM and GAM signals to S glycoprotein could be enhanced in a subset of
sera from NHC subjects that had lower levels of antibody. To do this, we included an additional tertiary
amplification step whereby after labelling primary antibodies with unconjugated mouse anti-human
antibodies, HRP-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulins antibody was added. The inclusion of the
amplification step enhanced the signal detected in nearly all samples, but had little effect on the
signal:noise ratio for IgG (Fig. 4B,C). The enhanced signal detected for IgM and IgA (Fig 4B) resulted
in higher signal:noise ratios for IgA and IgM, particularly at higher dilutions (S:N ratio at 1:540 dilution
on pre-amplification 1.4 vs 2.2 post-amplification for IgA, and 1.5 vs 2.1 for IgM; Fig. 4C). Thus, this
additional step is most beneficial to enhance signal detection when specific anti-S antibodies are
present at lower concentrations.
Anti-S, but not N, IgG, IgA and IgM responses are detectable in saliva from self-reported
symptomatic subjects
Saliva is an easily accessible fluid that can be self-collected through a non-invasive procedure and
could be beneficial for mass scale seroprevalence studies. Moreover, entry of the virus is via the
upper respiratory tract and antibodies in saliva may provide a first barrier to entry at this point.
Therefore, we investigated antibody responses in saliva from subjects who self-reported symptoms
consistent with COVID-19 (SRSS). Initial experiments without amplification, assessing individual antiIgG, IgA and IgM responses to S glycoprotein revealed the strongest signals were for IgA and IgG
(Fig. 5A). In contrast, responses against N were not detectable above the Pre19 background
responses (Fig 5B). As observed for sera, combining anti-IgG, IgA and IgM secondary antibodies
typically bolstered the signal against S glycoprotein compared to when these secondary antibodies
were used singly (S:N ratio at 1:32 dilution: IgG 1.53, IgA 1.40, IgM 1.1, Ig GAM 1.98; Fig. 5A).
Nevertheless, the intensity of this signal was modest even when saliva was diluted just 1:8. Therefore,
we assessed whether the amplification step used in Fig. 4 may improve the signal detected.
Amplification of saliva antibodies increased the absolute OD450 values against S glycoprotein for IgG,
IgM and GAM, but not for anti-N responses (Fig 5A, B). Amplification improved the signal:noise ratio
most for anti-S glycoprotein IgG and IgM antibodies, with little or no enhancement of the ratio for IgA
(Fig. 5C), particularly when the saliva was diluted. Adding the amplification step resulted in better
signal:noise ratios for GAM at higher concentrations (S:N ratio at 1:32 for GAM was 1.98 preamplification vs 2.4 post-amplification; Fig. 5C). Thus, anti-S glycoprotein antibodies can be
consistently detected in saliva from SRSS individuals.
Antibodies to S glycoprotein in saliva can be detected independently of serum responses

We have little understanding of the immune response that develops to SARS-CoV2 in the mucosa and
its relationship to serum. Therefore, the relationship between antibody responses was assessed in 39
matched saliva (1:2 dilution) and serum (1:40 dilution) from a cohort of health-care workers that were
recruited from the University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust 8. All of these subjects
were asymptomatic and PCR-negative at the time of sampling. Of these 39 subjects, 18 reported
never having COVID-19-associated symptoms, and thus were described as asymptomatic and 21 had
noted symptoms at some stage in the past that were consistent with COVID-19. Within this population
there are likely to be a mix of individuals who have never been infected, infected and asymptomatic
and infected and recovered.
We plotted the OD450 of the 1:2 dilution of saliva for the amplified anti-GAM to S glycoprotein against
the OD450 of the 1:40 dilution for sera. In the whole group, there was a modest correlation between
the OD450 of saliva and sera (R = 0.389, Fig. 6A). Nevertheless, the individuals with sera giving the
highest OD450 also had the highest saliva OD450. Splitting the group by whether they previously
recorded symptoms or not, did not influence the distribution of responses in saliva or serum (Fig. 6B).
The results were also categorized into whether individuals gave a negative or positive result based on
being lower or higher respectively of a cut-off (mean + 3 SD of 6 saliva and 8 sera from pre19
samples). There were 13 (33.3%) subjects with no response to S glycoprotein and 9 (23.1%) positive
in both saliva and serum. Six (15.4%) subjects were found with positive saliva but not serum and 11
(28.2%) with positive serum but not saliva. The agreement between the results was assessed with
kappa statistics. Binary agreement between the OD450 for serum and saliva was poor (κ = 0.13 ±0.15
SE). Therefore, assessment of both serum and saliva increases the detection of individuals who have
antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2,

Discussion
The recent pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has caused significant morbidity and mortality around
the world. The need to be able to identify those who have previously had a SARS-CoV-2 infection has
resulted in the development of immunoassays that are designed to measure antibodies as a signature
of exposure, and there is a need to make these as sensitive and specific as possible. Antibody assays
have also shown potential in diagnosing SARS-CoV-2-associated complications, such as helping
diagnose children who present with PIMS-TS (Pediatric Multisystemic Inflammatory Syndrome), yet
are PCR-negative for virus, and to define seroprevalence in symptomatic and asymptomatic health
care workers in a hospital setting3, 11, 12. These real-world examples of the use of this assay emphasize
the potential for these studies to aid in diagnosis and immunosurveillance. If post-infection
complications arise from COVID-19, then the availability of high-quality assays to detect prior infection
will be of obvious benefit. Collectively, these points add to the wealth of evidence supporting the
benefit and value of antibody assays in the current crisis.
Our method focused on implementing different approaches to find the best signal:noise ratio. To do
this, we used sera obtained from subjects prior to 2019, and sera from patients with confirmed RTPCR infection with different severities of disease. Within these sera from infected patients, we were
particularly interested in enhancing the signal:noise ratio in sera that either contained lower levels of
antibody or the ratio when sera were diluted. RBD, S1 and N were excellent at detecting antibodies in
sera from subjects with severe COVID-19, but were not as good as purified, whole, trimeric S when
antibody levels were more limiting. This is unlikely to be due to the source of antigen preparations as
we compared commercially purchased N, as well as antigens made within our own facility. Wider use
of S glycoprotein in assays has been facilitated by recent improvements that have increased yields as
much as 10-fold

13

. Due to higher protein yields obtained after purification from culture, some studies

suggest the use of RBD as a first screening test 14. This is likely to be useful for detecting responses in
those with higher levels of antibodies. However, RBD and S1 have a more limited set of native
epitopes present than whole native S glycoprotein and, at least in our studies, this potentially
negatively affected the signal:noise ratio. It could be hypothesized that a greater diversity of epitopes
is beneficial as there is more opportunity to capture a wider range of antibody specificities, and this
may be more important when antibodies are rarer in a patient sample. Using the trimeric S
glycoprotein may also help detect antibodies that block both binding and viral entry, which may offer
additional insights than examining responses to RBD alone. Coupled with this is the presence of nonnative epitopes in the RBD that are not present in the whole native trimeric S glycoprotein, and the
purity of the S glycoprotein generated, with the glycan profiles offering an additional quality assurance

step in determining purity. Moreover, the use of mammalian expression systems reduces the
likelihood of detecting antibodies to antigens that have been encountered during normal exposure to
pathogens, which can occur when organisms such as E. coli are used in the generation of
recombinant N production. In our studies, we consistently found higher background responses in sera
obtained prior to 2019 to N, the antigen used in the two chemiluminescence methods approved in the
U.K. for detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies15.
In our modified ELISA method, S protein gave a better discrimination between SARS-CoV-2 positive
and negative samples than N. One concern of using the extracellular region of S in assays has been
the risk of detecting antibodies that are cross-reactive between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV

16

.

Nevertheless, there are only around 8000 known SARS-CoV infected patients from 2003 and there
are now well over 7 million individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, so the proportional chance of
detecting one of these patients is low. Furthermore, there is a similar level of identity of N between
these viruses and thus, these are factors that can possibly influence responses to both SARS-CoV
viruses. The level of amino acid conservation of S with other human pathogen members of the
coronavirus family, such as HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E, is lower than to SARS-CoV. These two
strains are thought to account for 5-30% of upper respiratory tract infections and most individuals who
are infected with these strains do so from an early age

17, 18

. Additionally, the low identity of N and S

from SARS-CoV-2 with these viruses means cross-reactivity of antibodies to these proteins is minimal
4

.

Studies in cohorts of SARS-CoV-2 patients show that antibody responses develop at different rates
depending on the severity of the disease. In general, antibody titers are higher in patients with critical
or severe disease when compared to those with milder disease

19, 20

.

Likewise, in our investigations,

we found that samples from hospitalized patients had stronger IgG, IgA and IgM responses against
S1, RBD and N antigens. The important finding from these responses is that it is relatively simple to
detect antibodies in patients with severe disease and that focusing on detecting responses in those
who have much less severe disease or are asymptomatic may be advantageous for maximizing the
sensitivity of an antibody test. When the IgG subclasses were evaluated, IgG1 and IgG3 were the
most abundant in all samples tested, and they were also higher in hospitalized patients than in those
with mild disease. This is important because it has been suggested that antibodies may play a role in
pathogenesis, including the possible role of IgG1 as a mediator of acute lung injury in COVID-19 21. Of
interest, the IgG1 signal to S was consistently stronger than that of IgG3, whereas to N a
predominance of IgG1 or IgG3 was less clear. It would be a valuable study to examine IgG responses
longitudinally in patients with different presentations of SARS-CoV-2 and examine how this relates to
different presentations of infection.

Self-collected saliva is an attractive way to evaluate antibody prevalence due to the accessibility of the
sample and non-invasiveness of the procedure, but fewer studies have explored this as a route to
detect infected individuals. One reason for this is that it can be more challenging to detect antibodies
in saliva. The use of an additional tertiary antibody incubation with an HRP-conjugated goat antimouse Ig to amplify the signal of the bound IgG, IgA or IgM resulted in an enhanced detection of antiS, but not anti-N responses in individuals that had weak saliva antibody responses. The lack of
detection of anti-N Ig GAM responses in saliva was unexpected, as it was readily detectable in serum
and has been reported in saliva from more severe COVID-19 cases

22

. The reasons for our lack of

detection are unclear but may reflect greater partitioning of antibody responses between mucosal and
systemic sites than appreciated previously, or the lack of local exposure in the oral cavity to N
compared to other sites, or other unknown reasons.
When we assessed matched serum and saliva samples from a cohort of health care workers that was
part of a study recently published

3

,

there was a minimal correlation between anti-S antibodies in

serum and saliva. Nevertheless, many individuals were only single positive in serum or saliva. Thus,
relying on one of these fluids to determine exposure may significantly underestimate true levels of
exposure. Moreover, this discrepancy may have implications for our understanding of what forms a
protective antibody response, and whether antibodies in one or more sites are required for optimal
protection. In other studies from our group, this compartmentalization of antibody responses between
serum and saliva has been observed in the context of anti-pneumococcal vaccine responses23, and
has been seen in patients with multiple myeloma, who can have high serum levels of paraprotein
which is absent in saliva (Heaney, J. L. J. unpublished data) . This difference between mucosal and
systemic antibody responses may be due to antibodies secreted by local plasma cells in the buccal
cavity

8, 24

. Therefore, the kinetics of antibody induction in distinct mucosal sites still needs further

examination
Therefore, standard ELISA methods based on high-quality S protein can be modified to readily detect
antibody responses in serum and saliva from severe, mild and asymptomatic COVID-19 infections.
This method may serve as an important tool for assessing both short and long-term humoral immunity
for community-acquired COVID-19 infections and understanding the nature of natural and vaccineinduced protective responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection

Methods
Patient cohorts and ethical review
Paired serum and saliva samples were collected from health care workers at University Hospitals
Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust as part of the CoCo study. The study was approved by the London
- Camden & Kings Cross Research Ethics Committee reference 20/HRA/1817. Pre2019 negative
controls were recruited as part of a University of Birmingham study – reference ERN_16-178. All
participants in both studies provided written, informed consent prior to their enrolment. Surplus serum
samples from individuals with a history of PCR proven SARS-CoV-2 infection at University Hospitals
Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust and the Immunodeficiency Centre for Wales were fully
anonymized and used for assay development and quality assurance.

Serum samples were obtained from whole blood after centrifugation at 3500 RPM for 5 minutes and
were stored at -20 °C until used in the assay. Whole saliva samples were collected by passive dribble
into 50 ml saliva collection tubes for a timed period of 4 minutes. Samples were centrifuged (4000
RPM for 10 minutes) to separate cells and insoluble matter and the supernatant was removed and
stored at –20°C until use. On the day of assay samples were thawed and microcentrifuged (10000
RPM for 10 minutes).
Antigens used and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein production
The S1 subunit of the S glycoprotein and Nucleocapsid (N) proteins were obtained from the Native
Antigen Company (UK). The Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) was prepared at the University of
Birmingham. Briefly, the sequence encoding RBD (amino acids 319-541) of the SARS-CoV2 spike
protein including a C-terminal hexahistidine tag in the pCAGGS mammalian expression vector was
obtained from Florian Krammer (Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York)25. This construct
was used to transiently transfect 293T cells cultured in Opti-MEM (ThermoFisher Scientific) in 2L roller
bottles using Polyethylenimine (PEI) linear (Polysciences, Inc, USA). Supernatant was harvested on
day 4 after transfection, dialyzed into PBS overnight, and loaded onto a Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen)
column by gravity flow. The column was washed with PBS containing 10mM imidazole, eluted using
250 mM imidazole in PBS, then buffer exchanged into PBS using a PD10 column (GE Healthcare).

Expression plasmid encoding SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein

was transiently transfected into Human

Embryonic Kidney (HEK) 293F cells. Cells were maintained at a density of 0.2-3 x 106 cells per ml at
37°C, 8% CO2 and 125 rpm shaking in FreeStyle 293F media (Fisher Scientific). Prior to transfection
two solutions containing 25 ml Opti-MEM (Fisher Scientific) medium were prepared. Plasmid DNA was
added to one to give a final concentration after transfection of 310 μg/L. Polyethylenimine (PEI) max
reagent (1 mg/mL, pH 7) was added to the second solution to give a ratio of 3:1 PEI max: plasmid
DNA. The two solutions were combined and incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature. Cells were
transfected at a density of 1x106 cells per ml and incubated for 7 days at 37°C with 8% CO2 and 125
rpm shaking.
After harvesting, the cells were spun down at 4000 rpm for 30 minutes and the supernatant applied to
a 500 mL Stericup-HV sterile vacuum filtration system (Merck) with a pore size of 0.22 µm. The
supernatant containing SARS-CoV-2 S protein was purified using 5 mL HisTrap FF column connected
to an Akta Pure system (GE Healthcare). Prior to loading the sample, the column was washed with 10
column volumes of washing buffer (50 mM Na2PO4, 300 mM NaCl) at pH 7. The sample was loaded
onto the column at a speed of 2 mL/min. The column was washed with washing buffer (10 column
volumes) containing 50mM imidazole and eluted in 3 column volumes of elution buffer (300 mM
imidazole in washing buffer). The elution was concentrated by a Vivaspin column (100 kDa cut-off) to
a volume of 1 mL and buffer exchanged to phosphate buffered saline (PBS).
The Superdex 200 16 600 column was washed with PBS at a rate of 1 mL/min. After 2 hours, 1 mL of
the nickel affinity purified material was injected into the column. Fractions separated by SEC were
pooled according to their corresponding peaks on the Size Exclusion chromatograms. The target
fraction was concentrated in 100 kDa vivaspin (GE healthcare) tubes to ~1 mL.
ACE2 expression and purification
To determine the functionality of the purified SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein, SPR was performed using
truncated soluble angiotensin converting enzyme2 (hACE2). This construct is identical to full length
ACE2 except is truncated at position 626. This protein was expressed and purified identically as for
the SARS-CoV2 glycoprotein, with the exception of a smaller Vivaspin cutoff being used for buffer
exchanging. Following purification, the His-Tag was removed from ACE2 using HRV3C protease
cleavage (Thermo Fisher). Digestion was performed at a ratio of 1:20 HRV3C protease: ACE2 in 1x
HRV3C reaction buffer (Thermo Fisher) and incubated at 4°C overnight. To remove the HRV3C and
uncleaved ACE2 nickel affinity chromatography was performed, except the flow through was collected
rather than the elution.

Surface plasmon resonance (SPR)
After removing metallic contaminants via a pulse of EDTA (350 mM) for 1 min at a flow rate of
30μL/min, the chip was loaded with Ni2+ by injecting NiCl2 for 1 min at a flow rate of 10 μL/min. SARSCoV2 S protein (50 μg/mL) was injected at 10μL/min for 3 min. Control channels received neither
trimer nor NiCl2. Control cycles were performed by flowing the analyte over Ni2+-loaded NTA in the
absence of trimer; there were no indications of non-specific binding. The analyte was injected into the
trimer sample and control channels at a flow rate of 50 μL/min. Serial dilutions ranging from 200 nM to
3.125 nM were performed in triplicate along with HBS P+ buffer only as a control. Association was
recorded for 300 s and dissociation for 600 s. After each cycle of interaction, the NTA-chip surface
was regenerated with a pulse of EDTA (350 mM) for 1 min at a flow rate of 30 μL/min. A high flow rate
of analyte solution (50 μL/min) was used to minimize mass-transport limitation. The resulting data
were fit to a 1:1 binding model using Biacore Evaluation Software (GE Healthcare) and these fitted
curves were used to calculate KD.
ELISA methodology
96-well high-binding plates (Corning, USA) were coated overnight at 4 ºC with antigens at the stated
dilutions in sterile PBS. Plates were blocked with 2% BSA (Sigma, UK) prepared in PBS-0.1% Tween
20 for 1 h at room temperature (RT). Pre-diluted serum or saliva samples were added (100 µL per
dilution) and serially diluted and plates incubated for 1 h at RT. After washing with PBS-0.1% Tween,
100 µL of HRP-conjugated or unconjugated mouse anti-human immunoglobulins were added and
incubated for 1 h at RT. Anti-human immunoglobulin antibodies (anti-IgG, clone R-10 1:8000; anti-IgA
clones, 2D7 1:2000 and MG4.156 1:4000; anti-IgM clone AF6 1:2000; anti-IgG1 clone MG6.41,
1:3000; anti-IgG2 clone MG18.02 1: 3000; anti-IgG3 clone MG5.161 1:1000; anti-IgG4 clone RJ4
1:1000, are all clones generated in the University of Birmingham and available from Abingdon Health,
UK). In some experiments, HRP-labelled goat anti-mouse immunoglobulins (Southern Biotech, USA)
were added and incubated for 1 h at RT. After washing, plates were developed for 5-10 min with 100
µL of TMB core (Biorad, UK) and then stopped with 50 µL of 0.2M H2SO4. OD was recorded at 450 nm
using the Dynex DSX automated liquid handler (Dynex Technologies, USA). Signal:noise ratio (S:N
ratio) was calculated by dividing the average OD from the positive samples (signal) over the average
OD from the pre2019 negative controls (noise).
Statistical analysis
Pairwise Pearson’s correlation coefficient was used to calculate the correlation of matched serum and
saliva data. The data was classed as positive and negative based on the cut-off established from the
concentrations of pre2019 samples assuming that the values of the mean + 3 standard deviations

saliva and 0.629 in serum). The agreement between the classification of saliva and serum samples
was assessed using kappa statistics with STATA 16.1 (StataCorp LLC, USA).
