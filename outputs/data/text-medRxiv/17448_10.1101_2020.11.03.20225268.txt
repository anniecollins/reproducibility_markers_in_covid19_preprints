Test-adjusted results of mortality for Covid-19 in Germany, USA, UK
Jürgen Mimkes1 and Rainer Janssen2
Abstract
In a disease, where all infected persons show symptoms, it is reasonable to calculate
mortality by case to fatality rate CFR. Deaths follow infections by a certain time lag.
However, in the Covid-19 pandemic many infectious patients show no or hardly any
symptoms. The reported infections and deaths do not run parallel, but diverge with the
volume of tests.
Our investigations for Germany, USA and UK indicate that deaths do not follow the number
of infections, but the positive rate of tests, multiplied by a constant factor F and shifted by
about two weeks. These test adjusted results of mortality allow for the estimation of the
number of deaths of Covid-19 about two weeks ahead, even in a sharply rising state of the
pandemic. This gives medical authorities two weeks of time to plan for resources.
Introduction
Mortality is the most important indicator of a pandemic and scientists all over the world are
estimating mortality from Covid-19. A good introduction has been given in a scientific brief
by the World Health Organization WHO [1]. In a pandemic, two time series are generally
reported: the time series of daily infections (I k), and the time series for daily deaths (D k), as
provided by the Johns-Hopkins-University (JHU) in USA and the Robert-Koch-Institute (RKI) in
Germany. A wide range of values has been reported in the literature for the CFR, varying
with time and location [2-4]. In this paper we concentrate on mortality in Germany, USA, and
UK.
The RKI data for Germany
The series of daily registered new infections (I k) and the series of daily deaths (D k) are given
in figs. 1 and 2.

Calculation of CFR mortality
Normally, in mortality calculations the series of daily deaths (D k + L) follows the series of daily
infections (I k) by a time lag (L) and is smaller by the case fatality ratio CFR,
D k + L = CFR * I k.

(1)

In fig. 2 the maximum of deaths (300) follows the maximum of infected (6000) in fig. 1 about
two weeks (L = 13) later, and is smaller by the factor CFR = 300 / 6000 = 0.05. This leads to
D k + 13 = 0.05 * I k

(2)

Eq. (2) has been plotted in fig. 3.

Data and calculation of CFR mortality in fig. 3 agree for the first Covid-19 wave from March
to June, as would be expected. But from July on the calculations of daily deaths drifts away
to higher numbers, whereas the actual death data stay close to zero between July and
September, indicating only rising numbers in October. As the deaths in fig. 3 do not follow

the infections, the CFR is not any more constant, but is time variant, CFR k. A similar
observation has been made in many countries, as shown for USA and UK, below.
In a recent paper the authors [5, 6] proposed to explain the disagreement between
calculations (eq. 1) and mortal data in fig. 3 by considering a change in test volume. Indeed,
the test volume in fig. 4 in Germany has been increased from July until September by a
factor of 3.

Fig. 4. Daily test volume T k (weekly reports by RKI)

For a more detailed analysis, we divide the infection numbers I k by the test volume T k. Then
we scale the result by a mortality factor F = 2500 to obtain an optimal approximation to the
deaths series of the pandemic in fig. 5.

Fig. 5. Daily deaths data from RKI (bars) and infection numbers divided by test volume (solid line).

Apparently, in fig. 5 (solid line) the test adjusted infection data (I k / T k ) are in good
agreement with the deaths data (bars) throughout the pandemic,
D k + L = F * I k / T k = (2500 / T k) * I k = CFR k * I k
and we obtain a test depending mortality CFR k = 2500 / T k.

A test adjusted approach to mortality
In order to explain the test depending mortality CFR k in eq. 3 and fig. 5, we propose a test
adjusted approach to mortality: In diseases where many infectious patients show no or
hardly any symptoms, we do not know the total number of infections. But we can determine
the daily number of infections I k, T by the positive rate P k of daily infections of a certain daily
test volume T k,
I k, T = P k * T k.

(4)

In eq. 3 we may now replace the ratio I k / T k by the positive rate of tests P k of eq. 4,
D k+L = F * P k

(5)

In eq. 5 and fig. 5 the number of daily deaths D k + L follows the daily positive rate P k, and not
the daily number of infections I k as in eq. 1. The daily numbers of infections and deaths are
now represented in eq. 4 and eq. 5 by the daily positive rate P k and the daily test volume T k.
The daily test volume T k and the daily positive rate of infections P k are given by the RobertKoch-Institute, in figs. 4 and 6. The time lag L between infection and death is about 13 days
in Germany.

Fig. 6. Positive rate P k of daily tests (from weekly reports by RKI)

The relationship between the number of daily deaths and the number of daily infected in
eq. (1) is invalid, if the daily test volume is not constant. High numbers of infected do not
necessarily mean high number of deaths.
The number of deaths is only determined by the positive rate of daily infections P k, multiplied
by a constant mortality factor F.
This statement does not diminish the danger of Covid-19, but puts it on a scientific basis.
Accordingly, the daily positive rate of tests should be published in addition to the presently
dominating infection numbers, which are used for other purposes like tracking.
The daily positive ratio of tests leads to a realistic estimation of the number of deaths two
weeks in advance in eqs. 3 or 5 and in fig. 5.
This gives medical authorities two weeks of time to plan ahead for the numbers of severely
ill patients, which are closely related the number of deaths.

Fig. 10. Daily deaths data by JHU (bars) and calculation of D k + 14 according to eq. 1 (dashed line) and
eq. 5 (solid line).

Fig 10 shows again a good agreement of the test adjusted infection data (I k / T k) with the
deaths data. The time lag L is about 14 days and the mortality factor about F USA = 11,500.
The mortality factor F calculates the number of deaths of a country at a certain positive rate
of testing (P k), accordingly, the mortality factor will depend on the population of a country if
the modalities of testing are comparable.
Since the population in USA (320 million) is larger than the population in Germany
(83 million) by a factor of about 4, we would estimate F USA = 4 * F Ger = 10,000. This
estimation is of the same order as the result above, and supports the test adjusted approach
to mortality of Covid-19 in Germany and other countries.

JHU data for UK
In UK, the test adjusted infection data (I k / T k) also lead to a realistic prediction of the death
series of the Covid-19 pandemic (fig. 11). The time lag is about 14 days and the mortality
factor F UK about 2,700, deviating slightly from those in USA and Germany, if related to the
population.

Conclusions
In a pandemic with symptomatic and asymptomatic courses of the disease like in Covid-19,
the pure number of infections is not significant for the danger of the pandemic. The
indicator for the number of deaths is the positive rate (P k) of tests. It is a scale for the
number of deaths, and in addition, it is known about two weeks earlier.
