Abstract
The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a recently emerged human pathogen that has spread
widely since January 2020. Initially, the basic reproductive number, R0, was estimated to be 2.2
to 2.7. Here we provide a new estimate of this quantity. We collected extensive individual case
reports and estimated key epidemiology parameters, including the incubation period. Integrating
these estimates and high-resolution real-time human travel and infection data with
mathematical models, we estimated that the number of infected individuals during early
epidemic double every 2.4 days, and the R0 value is likely to be between 4.7 and 6.6. We further
show that quarantine and contact tracing of symptomatic individuals alone may not be effective
and early, strong control measures are needed to stop transmission of the virus.
One-sentence summary
By collecting and analyzing spatiotemporal data, we estimated the transmission potential for
2019-nCoV.
Main Text
2019-nCoV is the etiological agent of the current rapidly growing outbreak originating from
Wuhan, Hubei province, China (1). At the end of December 2019, 41 cases of ‘pneumonia of
unknown etiology’ were reported by the Wuhan Municipal Health Committee (2). On January 1,
2020, the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, which was determined to be the
epicenter of the outbreak, was closed. Seven days later, the causative agent of new disease was
formally announced by China CDC as 2019-nCoV. Human-to-human transmission was later
reported, i.e. infection of medical workers reported by the news and infection of individuals with
no recent history of Wuhan visit (3). In response, China CDC upgraded the emergency response
to Level 1 (the highest level) on January 15. By January 21, 2019-nCoV infection had spread to
most of the other provinces. On January 23, the city of Wuhan was locked down/quarantined, all
transportations into and out of the city and all mass gatherings was canceled. However, the
number of confirmed cases has continued to increase exponentially since January 16 (Fig. 1A and
B). On January 30, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a public health
emergency of international concern (4) . As of February 5, 2020, the virus outbreak lead to more
than 24,000 total confirmed cases and 494 deaths, and the virus has spread to 25 countries. Initial
estimates of the growth rate of the outbreak based on early case count data in Wuhan and
international flight data up to mid-January were 0.1 per day (a doubling time between 6-7 days)
and a basic reproductive number, R0 (defined as the average number of secondary cases an index
case infects when it is introduced in a susceptible population), of 2.2 and 2.7 (1, 5); however, the
rates of growth in the number of confirmed cases during late January (Fig. 1A and B) suggest a
doubling time much shorter than 6-7 days.
Here, with more up-to-date and high-resolution datasets across China until the end of January,
we estimated that the exponential growth rate and R0 are much higher than these previous
estimates. We improved on previous estimates in three distinct ways. First, we used an expanded
dataset of individual case reports based on our collection and direct translations of documents
published daily from official health commissions across provinces and special municipalities in
China (see Data Collection in Supplementary Materials). Second, we integrated high-resolution

real-time domestic travel data in China. Third, to address the issue of potential data collection
and methodological bias or incomplete control of confounding variables, we implemented two
distinct modeling approaches using different sets of data. These analyses produced estimates of
the exponential growth rates that are consistent with one another and higher than previous
estimates.
A unique feature of our case report dataset (Table S1) is that it includes case reports of many of
the first or the first few individuals who were confirmed with the virus infection in each province,
where dates of departure from Wuhan were reported. All together, we collected 140 individual
case reports (Table S1). These reports include demographic information including age, sex and
location of hospitalization, as well as epidemiological information including potential time
periods of infection, dates of symptom onset, hospitalization and case confirmation.
Using this dataset, we estimated the basic parameter distributions of durations from initial
exposure to symptom onset to hospitalization to discharge or death. Our estimate of the time
from initial exposure to symptom onset is 4.2 days with a 95% confidence interval (CI for short
below) between 3.5 and 5.1 days (Fig. 1C). This estimated period is about 1 day shorter and has
lower variance than a previous estimate (1). The shorter time is likely caused by the expanded
temporal range of our data that includes cases occurring after broad public awareness of the
disease. Patients reported in the Li et al. study (1) are all from Wuhan and most had symptom
onset before mid-January; in our dataset, many patients had symptom onset during or after midJanuary and were reported in provinces other than Hubei province (where Wuhan is the capital).
The time from symptom onset to hospitalization showed evidence of time dependence (Fig. 1D
and S1). Before January 18, the time from symptom onset to hospitalization was 5.5 days (CI: 4.6
to 6.6 days); whereas after January 18, the duration shortened significantly to 1.5 days only (CI:
1.2 to 1.9 days) (p-value <0.001 by Mann-Whitney U test). The change in the distribution
coincides with the period when infected cases were first confirmed in Thailand, news reports of
potential human-to-human transmission and upgrading of emergency response level to Level 1
by China CDC. The emerging consensus about the risk of 2019-nCoV likely led to significant
behavior change in symptomatic people seeking more timely medical care over this period. We
also found that the time from initial hospital admittance to discharge is 11.5 days (Fig. 1E; CI: 8.0
to 17.3 days) and the time from initial hospital admittance to death is 11.2 days (Fig. 1F; CI: 8.7
to 14.9 days).
Moving from empirical estimates of basic epidemiological parameters to an understanding of the
actual epidemiology of 2019-nCoV requires model-based inference. We thus used mathematical
models to integrate the empirical estimates with spatiotemporal domestic travel and infection
data outside of Hubei province to infer the outbreak dynamics in Wuhan. Inference based on
data outside of Hubei is more reliable because, as a result of the awareness of the risk of virus
transmission, other provinces implemented intensive surveillance system to detect individuals
with high temperatures and closely track travelers out of Wuhan using digital data to identify
infected individuals (6) as the outbreak in Wuhan unfolded.

We collected real-time travel data during the epidemic using the Baidu® Migration server (Fig.
2A and Table S2). The server an online platform summarizing mobile phone travel data through
Baidu® Huiyan [https://huiyan.baidu.com/]. Baidu® Huiyan is a widely used positioning system in
China. It processes >120 billion positioning requests daily through GPS, WIFI and other means
[https://huiyan.baidu.com/]. Therefore, the data represents a reliable, real-time and highresolution source of travel patterns in China. We extracted daily travel data from Wuhan to each
of the provinces. We found that in general, between 40,000 to 140,000 people in Wuhan traveled
to destinations outside of Hubei province daily before the lock-down of the city on January 23,
with travel peaks on January 9, 21 and 22 (Fig. 2B). Thus, it is likely that this massive flow of
people from Hubei province during January facilitated the rapid dissemination of virus.
We integrated the travel data into our inferential models using two approaches. The rationale of
the first model, the ‘first-arrival’ approach, is that an increasing fraction of people infected in
Wuhan increases the likelihood that one such case is exported to the other provinces. Hence,
how soon new cases are observed in other provinces can inform disease progression in Wuhan
(Fig. 2C). This has similarities with earlier analyses to estimate the size of the 2019-nCoV outbreak
in Wuhan based on international travel data (5, 7, 8), though inference based infected cases
outside of China may suffer large uncertainty due to the low volume of international travel. In
our model, we assumed exponential growth for the infected population I* in Wuhan, 𝐼∗ (𝑡) =
𝑒 𝑟(𝑡−𝑡0 ) , where 𝑟 is the exponential growth rate and 𝑡0 is the time of the exponential growth
initiation, i.e. 𝐼∗ (𝑡0 ) = 1. Note that 𝑡0 is likely to be later than the date of the first infection event,
because multiple infections may be needed before the onset of exponential growth (9). We used
travel data to each of the provinces (Table S3) and the earliest times that an infected individual
arrived at a province across a total of 26 provinces (Fig. 2D) to infer 𝑟 and 𝑡0 (see Supplementary
Materials for details). Model predictions of arrival times in the 26 provinces fitted the actual data
well (Fig. S2). We estimated that the date of the beginning of an exponential growth is December
20, 2019 (CI: December 11 to 26). This suggests that human infections in early December may be
due to spillovers from the animal reservoir or limited chains of transmission (10, 11). The growth
rate of the outbreak is estimated to be 0.29 per day (CI: 0.21 to 0.37 per day), a much higher rate
than two recent estimates (1, 5). This growth rate corresponds to a doubling time of 2.4 days.
We further estimated that the total infected population size in Wuhan was approximately 4,100
(CI: 2,423 to 6,178) on January 18, which is remarkably consistent with a recently posted estimate
(7). The estimated number of infected individuals is 18,700 (CI: 7,147, 38,663) on January 23, i.e.
the date when Wuhan started lock down. We projected that without any control measure, the
infected population would be approximately 233,400 (CI: 38,757 to 778,278) by the end of
January (Fig. S3).
An alternative model, the ‘case count’ approach, used daily case count data between January 19
and 26 from provinces outside of Hubei to infer the initiation and the growth rate of the outbreak.
We restricted the data to this period because during this time infected persons found outside of
Hubei province generally reported visiting Wuhan within 14 days of becoming symptomatic, i.e.
cases during that time period were indicative of the dynamics in Wuhan. We developed a metapopulation model based on the classical SEIR model (12). We assumed a deterministic
exponential growth for the infected populations in Wuhan, whereas in other provinces, we

represented the trajectory of infected individuals who travelled from Wuhan using a stochastic
agent-based model. The transitions of the infected individuals from symptom onset to
hospitalization and then to case confirmation were assumed to follow the distributions inferred
from the case report data (see Supplementary Materials for detail). Simulation of the model using
best fit parameters showed that the model described the observed case counts over time well
(Fig. 2E). The estimated date of exponential growth initiation is December 16, 2019 (CI: December
12 to Dec 21) and the exponential growth rate is 0.30 per day (CI: 0.26 to 0.34 per day). These
estimates are consistent with estimates in the ‘first arrival’ approach (Fig. 2F and G, and Fig. S4).
We note that in both approaches, we assumed perfect detection of infected cases outside of
Hubei province, i.e. the dates of first arrival and the number of case counts are accurate. This
could be a reasonable assumption to make for symptomatic individuals because of the intensive
surveillance implemented in China, for example, tracking individuals’ movement from digital
transportation data (6). However, it is possible that a fraction of infected individuals, for example,
individuals with mild or no symptoms (13), were not hospitalized, in which case we will
underestimate the true size of the infected population in Wuhan. We undertook sensitivity
analyses to investigate how our current estimates are affected by this issue using both
approaches (see Supplementary Materials for detail). We found that if a proportion of cases
remained undetected, the time of exponential initiation would be earlier than December 20,
translating into a larger population of infected individuals in January, but the estimation of the
growth rate remained the same. Overall, the convergence of the estimates of the exponential
growth rate from the two approaches emphasizes the robustness of our estimates to modeldependent assumptions.
Our estimated outbreak growth rate is significantly higher than two recent reports where the
growth rate was estimated to be 0.1 per day (1, 5). This estimate were based on early case counts
from Wuhan (1) or international air travel data (5). However, these data suffer from important
limitations. The reported case counts in Wuhan during early outbreak are likely to be
underreported because of many factors, and because of the low numbers of individuals traveling
abroad compared to the total population size in Wuhan, inference of the infected population size
and outbreak growth rate from infected cases outside of China suffers from large uncertainty (7,
8). Our estimated exponential growth rate, 0.29/day (a doubling time of 2.4 days) is consistent
the rapidly growing outbreak during late January (Fig. 1A).
Using the exponential growth rate, we next estimated the range of the basic reproductive
number, R0. It has been shown that this estimation depends on the distributions of the latent
period (defined as the period between the times when an individual infected and become
infectious) and the infectious period (14). For both periods, we assumed a gamma distribution
and varied the mean and the shape parameter of the gamma distributions in a large range to
reflect the uncertainties in these distributions (see Supplementary Materials). It is not clear when
an individual becomes infectious; thus, we considered two scenarios: 1) the latent period is the
same as the incubation period, and 2) the latent period is 2 days shorter than the incubation
period, i.e. individuals start to transmit 2 days before symptom onset. Integrating uncertainties
in the exponential growth rate estimated from the ‘first arrival’ approach and the uncertainties

in the duration of latent and infectious periods, we estimated the values of R0 to be 6.3 (CI: 3.3
to 11.3) and 4.7 (CI: 2.8 to 7.6), for the first and second scenarios, respectively (Fig. 3A). When
using the estimates from the ‘case count’ approach, we estimated slightly higher R0 values of 6.6
(CI: 4.0 to 10.5) and 4.9 (CI: 3.3 to 7.2), for the first and second scenarios, respectively (Fig. S5).
Overall, we report R0 values are likely be between 4.7 and 6.6 with a CI between 2.8 to 11.3. We
argue that the high R0 and a relatively short incubation period lead to the extremely rapid growth
of the of 2019-nCoV outbreak as compared to the 2003 SARS epidemic where R0 was estimated
to be between 2.2 to 3.6 (15, 16).
The high R0 values we estimated have important implications for disease control. For example,
1
basic theory predicts that the force of infection has to be reduced by 1 − 𝑅 to guarantee
0

extinction of the disease. At 𝑅0 = 2.2 this fraction is only 55%, but at 𝑅0 = 6.7 this fraction rises
to 85%. To translate this into meaningful predictions, we use the framework proposed by Lipsitch
et al (16) with the parameters we estimated for 2019-nCoV. Importantly, given the recent report
of transmission of the virus from asymptomatic individuals (13), we considered the existence of
a fraction of infected individuals who is asymptomatic and can transmit the virus (see
Supplementary Materials). Results show that if as low as 20% of infected persons are
asymptomatic and can transmit the virus, then even 95% quarantine efficacy will not be able to
contain the virus (Fig. 3B). Given the rapid rate of spread, the sensitivity of control effort
effectiveness to asymptomatic infections and the potential of transmission before symptom
onset, we need to be aware of the difficulty of controlling 2019-nCoV once it establishes in a new
population (17). Future field, laboratory and modeling studies aimed to address the unknowns,
such as the fraction of asymptomatic individuals, the time when individuals become infectious
and the existence of superspreaders are needed to accurately predict the impact of various
control strategies (9, 17).
Fortunately, we see evidence that control efforts have a measurable effect on the rate of spread.
Since January 23, Wuhan and other cities in Hubei province implemented vigorous control
measures, such as closing down transportation and mass gatherings in the city; whereas, other
provinces also escalated the public health alert level and implemented strong control measures.
We noted that the growth rate of the daily number of new cases in provinces outside of Hubei
slowed down gradually since late January (Fig. 3B). Due to the closure of Wuhan (and other cities
in Hubei), the number of cases reported in other provinces during this period shall start to track
local infection dynamics rather than imports from Wuhan. We estimated that the exponential
growth rate is decreased to 0.14 per day (CI: 0.12 to 0.15 per day) since January 30. Based on this
growth rate and an R0 between 4.7 to 6.6 before the control measures, a calculation following
the formula in Ref. (14) suggested that a growth rate decreasing from 0.29 per day to 0.14 per
day translates to a 50%-59% decrease in R0 to between 2.3 to 3.0. This is in agreement with
previous estimates of the impact of effective social distancing during 1918 influenza pandemic
(18). Thus, the reduction in growth rate may reflect the impact of vigorous control measures
implemented and individual behavior changes in China during the course of the outbreak.

The 2019-nCoV epidemic is still rapidly growing and spread to more than 20 countries as of
February 5, 2020. Here, we estimated the growth rate of the early outbreak in Wuhan to be 0.29
per day (a doubling time of 2.4 days), and the reproductive number, R0, to be between 4.7 to 6.6
(CI: 2.8 to 11.3). Among many factors, the Lunar New Year Travel rush in early and mid-January
2020 may or may not play a role in the high outbreak growth rate, although SARS epidemic also
overlapped with the Lunar New Year Travel rush. How contiguous the 2019-nCoV is in other
countries remains to be seen. If the value of R0 is as high in other countries, our results suggest
that active and strong population-wide social distancing efforts, such as closing down
transportation system, schools, discouraging travel, etc., might be needed to reduce the overall
contacts to contain the spread of the virus.

spread. Strategies considered are quarantine of symptomatic individuals and individuals who had
contacts with them (x-axis) and population-level efforts to reduce overall contact rates (y-axis).
Different colored lines denote different assumptions of the fraction of asymptomatic individuals
in the infected population. Solid and dashed lines correspond to R0=4.7 and 6.3 (i.e. the estimated
means of R0), respectively. (C) The cumulative number of cases outside of Hubei province in late
January 2020. The growth rate decreased to 0.14 per day since January 30. The dashed black line
shows January 23 when Wuhan is locked down.
