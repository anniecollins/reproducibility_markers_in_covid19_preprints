Abstract
Introduction : The main target of COVID-19 is the lungs where it may cause pneumonia
in severely ill patients. Chest X- ray is an important diagnostic test to assess the lung
for the damaging effects of COVID-19. Many other microbial pathogens can also cause
damage to lungs leading to pneumonia but there are certain radiological features which can
favor the diagnosis of pneumonia caused by COVID-19. With the rising number of cases
of COVID-19, it would be imperative to develop computer programs which may assist the
health professionals in the prevailing scenario.
Materials & Methods : A total of two hundred and seventy eight (278) images of chest
X-rays have been assessed by applying ResNet-50 convolutional neural network architectures
in the present study. The digital images were acquired from the public repositories provided
by University of Montreal and National Institutes of Health. These digital images of Chest
X-rays were divided into three groups labeled as normal, pneumonia and COVID- 19. The
third group contains digital images of chest X-rays of patients diagnosed with COVID-19
infection while the second group contains images of lung with pneumonia caused by other
pathogens.
Results : The radiological images included in the data set are 89 images of lungs with
COVID-19 infection, 93 images of lungs without any radiological abnormality and 96 images
of patient with pneumonia caused by other pathogens. In this data set, 80% of the images
were employed for training, and 20% for testing. A pre-trained (on ImageNet data set)
ResNet-50 architecture was used to diagnose the cases of COVID-19 infections on lung Xray images. The analysis of the data revealed that computer vision based program achieved
diagnostic accuracy of 98.18 %, and F1-score of 98.19.
Conclusion : The performance of convolutional neural network regarding the differentiation
of pulmonary changes caused by COVID-19 from the other type of pneumonias on digital
images of the chest X- rays is excellent and it may be an extremely useful adjunct tool for
the health professionals.

1. Introduction
The outbreak of novel corona virus in the Wuhan city and its spread to other countries of
the world has created a lot of stress and anxiety among the residents and health professionals
around the globe. Corona virus is an enveloped RNA virus. There are four most common
types of human corona viruses (229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1) which causes upper respiratory tract infections such as common cold [1] . Some new strains of corona viruses like
SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and a recently identified COVID-2019 virus evolved from corona
viruses which are zoonotic in origin and these types can cause cataclysmic ailment in human
being. The Middle East respiratory syndrome corona virus (MERS-CoV) is transferred to
human beings from the camels. The civet cats are the source of severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and from these infected cats; it is transmitted to human
beings. An outbreak of SARS-CoV has been reported from china in 2002-2003 and MERSCoV has been identified in the patients with pneumonia in Middle East [2–4] .And now the
recently identified novel coronavirus (COVID -2019) has been detected in the patients in
the Wuhan city of China [5] . The mode of transmission is person to person via respiratory
droplets and median incubation period is four days [6]. The disease in mild in majority
of patients but in some cases severe to critical illness may occur which is characterized by
breathing difficulty to respiratory failure. The severity of disease is more associated with
old age. Pneumonia is the most common problem in case of severe disease. The patients
with pneumonia present with the clinical features of fever, fatigue, dry cough, anorexia,
myalgia, dyspnea and sputum production [7]. Radiological imaging is an important tool
for the evaluation of lung diseases. In COVID-19 infection, CT scan revealed ground glass
opacification which are usually bilateral and involve peripheral area of lower lobe of lungs
and the radiological findings may also be present even in subclinical cases [8].
Microbial infections are the most important cause of pneumonia which include bacteria, viruses and fungi. The differentiation of pneumonia caused by viruses and particularly
COVID -19 on radiological imaging is a quite difficult task which requires vast experience
and strong competency in the field of radiology. The development of computer vision based
programs for the detection of radiological features associated with COVID-19 on the radiological images of the lungs would be a very useful tool to facilitate heath professionals in
fighting against this lethal pathogen which has affected the whole world.
The aim and objective of the present study is to evaluate the usefulness and diagnostic
accuracy of computer vision-based system for the identification of radiological changes in
the lungs of patients infected with COVID –19.

In the present study, two hundred and seventy eight (278) images of chest X-rays have
been evaluated which were acquired from the public repositories provided by University of

Montreal and National Institutes of Health [9, 10]. The digital images of Chest X-rays were
divided into three groups. Group 1 included ninety three (93) digital images of chest X-ray
which have no radiological abnormality and this group was labeled as Normal. Group 2
comprised of ninety six (96) digital images of chest X-rays with the radiological features of
pneumonia and these patients developed pneumonia due to causes other than COVID-19
infection and this group was labeled as Pneumonia. The third group contained eighty nine
(89) digital images of chest X-rays of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection and it
was labeled as COVID-19.
For the assessment of these digital images of chest X-rays of all three groups, ResNet-50
convolutional neural network architectures has been used [11]. As our dataset was limited,
we used transfer learning approach and pre-trained our models using the ImageNet data [12].
The available X-ray dataset was divided into two classes that included the Training set (80%
of total dataset, i.e., 223 images), and the Testing set (20% of total dataset, i.e., 55 images).
The training set is further divided into 192 images for training and 31 images for validation.
We apply a number of augmentation techniques as well as a 50% dropout [13] to avoid overfitting. A list of the the applied augmentations and their descriptions are given in Table 1.
All images were resized to 224 × 224 pixels before being fed to the network.

Description
A random horizontal flip is applied with probability 0.5.
Inputs are randomly rotated with an angle in the range -10 to 10
degrees with 75% probability..
A random zoom in the range of 0 10 10% with 75% probability is
applied.
A random lightning and contrast change controlled is applied with
75% probability.
A random symmetric warp of magnitude between -0.2 and 0.2 is
applied with 75% probability.

We only trained the last 6-layer of the pre-trained Resnet-50 network and the remaining
layers were kept fixed. We used a cyclical learning rate, ranging from 1e-6 to 1e-3 and saved
the best model in every cycle using train and validation accuracy. FastAI API [14] was used
to run all the algorithms on a PC with Intel-i5 with RTX-2070 GPU and 16 GB of ram.
3. Results
The classification results in the form of a confusion matrix for both training and test
data are shown in Figure 1. Note that, only one image belonging to COVID-19 class has
been classified as normal in both training and test data. Similarly, during training only one
COVID-19 image was confused as non-COVID-pneumonia. This shows that the COVID-19

X-rays contain significant discriminatory information that can be extracted by a convolutional neural network. Using this extracted information, we can easily differentiate between
normal, non-COVID-pneumonia and COVID-19 cases.
The results in the confusion matrix are succinctly described in terms of average precision,
average recall and F1-scores in Table 2 and 3. The high value of F1-score for the test data
indicates the efficacy of our proposed method.

coming days. The WHO has declared COVID-19 infection as pandemic. Extensive efforts are
being done to prevent the infection and to control the damage caused by this pathogen but
with the passage of time more and more cases are being diagnosed with COVID-19 infection.
The most important organ attacked by COVID-19 is lung, which leads to inflammatory
changes in lungs and it may cause respiratory insufficiency. The reduced oxygen supply
(hypoxia) to the human cells will have deleterious effects on the human living cells and
ultimately multi-organ failure may also develop in some cases which has high mortality
rate. The radiological assessment of lung is important part of patient care in the severely ill
patient infected with COVID-19. The evaluation of radiological imaging is a specialized job
and requires the opinion of the consultant radiologist. In the prevailing current scenario,
it would be imperative to develop adjunct tool which could assist the health professionals
who are heavily burdened in the current situation. In this regard, one of the important
areas is the interpretation of radiological images with the help of artificial intelligence. The
application of deep learning machine approached may yield promising results in the detection
of morphological changes in the lung of patients infected with COVID-19 on digital images
of chest X- rays. The computer vision based programs may identify the subtle changes on
the digital images which may not be detectable or visible to human eye. The convolutional
neural network has been applied for the diagnosis of tuberculosis on the Chest X- rays and
it has revealed very good results [15]. Similarly another study revealed that deep learning
algorithms can help in the identification of lung opacities, enlargement of heart and pleural
effusion on chest X-rays [16]. Due to the better automated feature extraction capability, the
convolutional neural networks which have been trained on natural images turned out to be
very successful in the classification of images [17]. The performance of convolutional neural
network related to the imaging modalities with less human intervention has been found to
be better than other conventional methods of machine learning [18].
In the present study, ResNet-50 convolutional neural network architectures have been
applied which yielded the accuracy of 98.18 %, and F1-score of 98.19. The result of the
present study are very encouraging and in near future it could be a very useful adjunct tool
for the assessment of chest X- rays in case of suspected patients of COVID-19. The number
of cases is one the limitation of this study. The organization and collection of the data of
patient of COVID -19 from different countries of world may be planned and subjected to
research for further improvement in the diagnostic modalities.
5. Conclusion
The performance of convolutional neural network regarding the differentiation of pulmonary changes caused by COVID-19 from the other type of pneumonias on digital images
of the chest X- rays is extremely good. It may be a very useful adjunct tool for the identification of lung changes caused by COVID-19 infection.
