Abstract
There has been an outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan city, Hubei
province, China since December 2019. Cases have been exported to other parts of China and
more than 20 countries. We provide estimates of the daily trend in the size of the epidemic in
Wuhan based on detailed information of 10,940 confirmed cases outside Hubei province.

Background
As of February 13, 2020, the National Health Commission (NHC) of China has
confirmed a total of 63,851 cases of COVID-19 in mainland China, including 10,204 severe
cases, 1,380 deaths, and 6,723 recoveries. An additional total of 10,109 suspected cases were
reported. Wuhan, the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak, has 35,991 confirmed cases. The
NHC has also received 53 confirmed reports in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region,
China, 10 in Macau Special Administrative Region, China, and 18 in Taiwan, China. [1]
More than 500 cases have been detected outside China.
Despite the considerable medical resources and personnel that have been dispensed to
combat COVID-19 in Hubei province, hospital capacity continues to be overburdened. There
continues to be a shortage of hospital beds needed to accommodate the rising number of
COVID-19 patients. In response to this growing crisis, Wuhan plans to transform hotels,
venues, training centers and college dorms into quarantine and treatment centers for COVID19 patients. Further, 13 mobile cabin hospitals will be built to provide over 10,000 beds. [2]
Therefore, a careful and precise understanding of the potential number of cases in Wuhan is
crucial for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 outbreak. Wu et al. (2020) provided
an estimate of the total number of cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan, using the number of cases
exported from Wuhan to cities outside mainland China. [3] However, since the number of
cases exported from Wuhan to cities outside mainland China is small, their estimate of the
size of the epidemic in Wuhan may not be precise and has large variability. Using the number

You et al. (2020) proposed a new method to estimate the total number of cases of COVID-19
in Wuhan. [4] However, their method can only give an estimate of the cumulative number of
cases until a certain date.
In this article, we propose a new statistical method to estimate daily number of cases in
Wuhan under a similar dynamic equation model as the one in [3]. Unlike the one in [3], our
method can also handle the missing information on whether a case is exported from Wuhan.

Results
We estimate the number of cases that should be reported in Wuhan by January 11, 2020,
is 4,094 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3,980 – 4,211) and 58,153 (95% CI: 56,532 – 59,811)
by February 13, 2020. Figure 1 shows how the estimated number of cases in Wuhan increases
over time, together with the 95% confidence bands. As shown in Figure 2, the reporting rate
has grown rapidly from 1.41% (95% CI: 1.37% - 1.45%) on January 20, 2020, to 61.89%
(95% CI: 60.17% - 63.66%) on February 13, 2020. The date of first infection is estimated as
November 30, 2019.

Data Description
Data retrieved from publicly available records from provincial and municipal health
commissions in China and ministries of health in other countries included detailed
information for 10,940 confirmed cases outside Hubei province, including region, gender,
age, date of symptom onset, date of confirmation, history of travel or residency in Wuhan,
and date of departure from Wuhan. Among the 7,500 patients with gender data, 3,509
(46.79%) are female. The mean age of patients is 44.48 and the median age is 44. The
youngest confirmed patient outside Hubei province was only five days old while the oldest is
97 years old.
We display the epidemiological data categorized by the date of confirmation in Table 2.
An imported case means a patient that had been to Wuhan and was detected outside Hubei
province. A local case means a confirmed case that had not been to Wuhan. Among the total
of 10,940 cases, 6,903 (63.10%) have such epidemiological information. The number of
imported cases reached its peak on January 29, 2020, and the fourth column of Table 2 shows
that the proportion of imported cases declines over time. This might reflect the effect of
containment measures taken in Hubei province to control the COVID-19 outbreak. [5]
Meanwhile, the daily counts of local cases are over 300 from February 2, 2020, to February 7,
2020, which indicate that infections among local residents should be a major concern for
authorities outside Hubei province.
The last column of Table 2 lists the mean time from symptom onset to confirmation for
patients confirmed on each day. The median duration of all cases is 5 days, and the mean is
5.54 days. In general, the detection period decreased in the first week after January 20, 2020,
but increased since then. The improvements in detection speed and capacity might cause the
initial decline, and the rise may be due to more thorough screening, leading to the detection of
patients with mild symptoms who would otherwise not go to the hospitals. [6]

Assumptions
The proposed method relies on the following assumptions:
1. Between January 10, 2020, and January 23, 2020, the average daily proportion of
departing from Wuhan is 𝑝.
2. There is a 𝑑 = 𝑑1 + 𝑑2 -day window between infection to detection, including a 𝑑1 day incubation period and a 𝑑2 -day delay from symptom onset to detection.
3. Trip durations are long enough that a traveling patient infected in Wuhan will develop
symptoms and be detected in other places rather than after returning to Wuhan.
4. All travelers leaving Wuhan, including transfer passengers, have the same risk of
infection as local residents.

5. Traveling is independent of the exposure risk to COVID-19 or of infection status.
6. Patients are not able to travel 𝑑 days after infection.
7. Recoveries are not considered in this method.
8. The proportion of imported cases in the patients with no information is the same as
the observed proportion on each day.
We next make some remarks about our assumptions.
a. January 10, 2020, is the start of Chinese New Year travel rush, and January 23, 2020,
is the date of Wuhan lockdown. [5] In the total of 10,940 cases, only 131 (1.2%)
cases’ date of departure from Wuhan are not in this period. They are excluded from
our analysis.
b. If the true average daily proportion of leaving Wuhan is larger the assumed 𝑝, this
violation of Assumption 1 could lead to overestimation of the number of cases in
Wuhan,
c. If the average time from infection to detection is longer than the assumed 𝑑 days,
this violation of Assumption 2 would lead to an overestimation.
d. If travelers have a lower risk of infection than residents in Wuhan, this violation of
Assumption 4 would cause an underestimation.
e. If infected individuals are less likely to travel due to the health conditions, this
violation of Assumption 5 would cause an underestimation.
f.

Given that the number of recoveries in early days of outbreak is relatively small
compared to the number of COVID-19 patients, Assumption 8 should not
significantly influence the result.

We perform Sensitivity Analysis on the effect of some of the violations on our results.

Methods
The spread of COVID-19 outside Hubei province is relatively controlled given the
adequate medical resources. We use the reported number outside Hubei as it is a fairly
accurate representation of the actual epidemic situation. In this modelling study, we first
estimate the epidemic size in Wuhan from January 11, 2020, to February 13, 2020, based on
the confirmed cases outside Hubei province that left Wuhan by January 23, 2020. Since some
confirmed cases have no information on whether they visited Wuhan before, we adjust the
number of imported cases after taking these missing values into account. We then calculate
the reporting rate in Wuhan from January 20, 2020, to February 13, 2020. Finally, we
estimate the date when the first patient was infected.

number of recoveries is still relatively small compared to infected cases. The growth rate of

Estimation
We use data on the confirmed cases who left Wuhan between January 10, 2020 and
January 23, 2020, to estimate K. Under Assumption 2, cases infected on Day 𝑡 will be
detected on Day 𝑡 + 𝑑, so the number of infected cases in Wuhan is 𝑁𝑡+𝑑 on Day 𝑡. If
𝑡0 ≤ 𝑡 ≤ 𝑡0 + 𝑑, there should be no confirmed cases. If 𝑡0 + 𝑑 < 𝑡 ≤ 𝑡0 + 2𝑑, imported
cases on Day 𝑡 are infected in Wuhan on Day 𝑡 − 𝑑. If 𝑡 > 𝑡0 + 2𝑑, under Assumption 6,
𝑁𝑡−𝑑 patients are not able to travel. There are 𝑁𝑡 infected cases in Wuhan on Day 𝑡 − 𝑑,
the number of imported cases 𝑥𝑡 on Day 𝑡 follows a binomial(𝑁𝑡 , 𝑝) distribution, where
𝑝 is the assumed average daily proportion of leaving Wuhan between January 10, 2020, and
January 23, 2020. Let 𝑋𝑡 be the cumulative number of imported cases by Day 𝑡, then

The reporting rate is the reported cumulative number of cases in Wuhan on Day 𝑡 divided by

our estimated number 𝑁
the equation 𝑁𝑡0 = 1.
Determining the number of imported cases 𝑥𝑡 plays a crucial role in the modeling
procedure. Note that not all cases have clear records on the history of travel or residency in
Wuhan, we need to impute the missing values. Under Assumption 8, the proportion of

The average daily proportion of leaving Wuhan between January 10, 2020 and January
23, 2020 is estimated to be the ratio of daily volume of travelers to the population of Wuhan
(14 million). More than 5 million people have left Wuhan due to the Spring Festival and
epidemic. [8]. The Chinese New Year travel rush started at January 10, 2020, and the
lockdown of Wuhan city happened on January 23, 2020. During the travel rush, 34% of the
passengers traveled across 300 km. [9] Major cities outside Hubei province are generally over
300 km from Wuhan. This would imply, on average, the daily probability 𝑝 of traveling
from Wuhan to places outside Hubei province would be 5*0.34/14/14=0.009. Li et al.
estimated that the mean incubation period of 425 patients with COVID-19 was 5.2 days (95%
CI, 4.1 - 7.0). [10] The mean time from symptom onset to detection calculated from our data
is 5.54 days, so we choose 𝑑1 = 𝑑2 = 5 days. January 29, 2020, has the maximum count of
imported cases. Since 𝑥𝑡 has a binomial(𝑁𝑡 − 𝑁𝑡−𝑑 , 𝑝) distribution with constant 𝑝, 𝑁𝑡 −
𝑁𝑡−𝑑 also reaches its maximum at 𝑡 = January 29, 2020. From the logistic function (2), 𝑡𝑐
𝑑

is the midpoint of 𝑡 and 𝑡 − 𝑑, that is 𝑡 − 2 = January 24, 2020, which is shortly after the
lockdown of Wuhan city. [5] Wu et al. estimated the epidemic doubling time as 6.4 days
(95% CI: 5.8 – 7.1) as of January 25, 2020. [3] From this result, we estimate that

Compared to the baseline, the parameters are expanded or shrunk by about 30% to reflect
the possible uncertainty. Table 4 summaries the estimate the number of cases should be
reported on January 11, 2020, and February 13, 2020, under baseline assumptions and
alternative scenarios. Confidence intervals are omitted. The currently reported number 35,991
on February 13, 2020, is substantially smaller than the estimate of our most conservative
scenario.

Conclusions
The estimated reporting case rate has increased rapidly, reaching over 30% by February
11, 2020. It is almost doubled in the following two days, mainly due to the inclusion of
14,031 clinically diagnosed cases in the case reports of Wuhan. This might indicate that the
testing capacity of Wuhan is insufficient. Clinical diagnosis could be a good complement to
the current method of confirmation. The currently reported number of 35,991 cases as of
February 13, 2020, is still far below our estimate of 58,153. There may still be a lot of
unreported cases. More thorough screening of all patients with a mild or moderate symptoms
of respiratory diseases should be conducted to better control the spread of COVID-19.
