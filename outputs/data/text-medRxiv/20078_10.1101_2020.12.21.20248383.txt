Summary
Modern transportation plays a key role in the long-distance and rapid spread of
SARS-CoV-2. However, little is known about the transmission risk of
SARS-CoV-2 on confined vehicles, such as airplanes and trains. Based on the
itinerary and epidemiological data of COVID-19 cases and close contacts
among 9,265 airline passengers on 291 airplanes and 29,335 passengers on
830 high-speed trains in China from December 20, 2019 to March 17, 2020,
we estimated that the upper bound of overall attack rate of COVID-19 among
passengers was 0.60% (95% confidence interval: 0.43%-0.84%) for airplanes
and 0.35% (0.28%-0.44%) for trains departing from Wuhan before its
lockdown, respectively. The reproduction number during travel ranged from
0.12 to 0.19 on airplanes and from 0.07 to 0.12 on trains, with the risk varying
by seat distance from the index case and joint travel time, but the difference in
risk was not significant between the types of aircraft and train. Overall, the risk
of SARS-CoV-2 transmission on planes and high-speed trains with high
efficiency air filtration devices was relatively low. Our findings improve
understanding of COVID-19 spread during travel and may inform response
efforts, such as lifting travel restrictions, and resuming transportation in the
pandemic.

Main

The current COVID-19 pandemic has affected nearly all countries across the
world within a matter of months, causing tens of millions of infections and
hundreds of thousands of deaths in 2020

1

. Large-scale population

movements through long-distance travel are one of the most important
reasons for the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 across regions and countries

2,3

.

Many studies have shown that SARS-Cov-2 transmission in a city or country
was initiated by the virus introduced by domestic or international travellers
from epidemic regions, and the number of imported cases by country in the
early stage of the pandemic has a significant correlation with the volume of
travellers from other epidemic areas

4-8

. Towards this, many domestic and

international travel routes have been restricted or suspended to contain the
further spread of SARS-CoV-2 9.
Airplanes and trains have become some of the most important modes of
transportation for long-distance travel within and across many countries,
particular in Europe, North America, and East Asia. According to the World
Bank statistics, the number of global air passengers reached 4.2 billion in 2018
10

, and about 8 billion passengers travelled on national railway networks in the

countries of the European Union in 2018, with 2 billion passengers travelling
by high-speed trains in mainland China

11,12

. Due to travel restrictions during

the pandemic, the transport industry has been hit hard. For countries trying to
resume

socioeconomic

activities

and

transportation,

the

spread

of

SARS-CoV-2 through travellers may lead to another resurgence and lockdown
if the risk is not fully recognised and addressed. For example, according to the
Flightradar24 (www.flightradar24.com), there were as many as 6972 flights in
the skies above North America two days ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday in
the United States (US) in 2020, which were more than that in 2018, despite
recommendations from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) to reduce non-essential travelling during the winter wave of COVID-19
13

.
Airlines and railways preparing to resume timetables have been also

struggling to implement social distancing guidelines, such as leaving the
14,15

middle seats unoccupied on airplanes or trains to reduce COVID-19 risk

.

These measures were in response to studies suggesting increased
SARS-CoV-2 transmission among passengers in confined spaces

16-22

; for

example, Speake et al. (2020) found flight-associated SARS-CoV-2
transmission on a domestic flight route in Australia and reported that the
secondary infectious rate was about 9.8% in the mid-portion of the cabin 16. On
the contrary, some research observed that the risk of SARS-CoV-2
transmission on flights was very low

23,24

. For example, no onward

transmission was found on an airplane from China to Canada on January 22,
2020, carrying Canada’s first reported COVID-19 patient travelling from
Wuhan

25,26

. However, drawing robust conclusions from studies employing

small samples is especially hard, as they are constrained by the availability of
travel and epidemiological data by different transportation sources.
The potential spread of pathogens via transportation routes has also been
reported and studied among other infectious diseases

27,28

, such as severe

acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 29-31, tuberculosis 32-35, pandemic influenza
A(H1N1)

36-39

and measles

40

. However, results are not consistent across

case-studies. Olsen et al. (2003) analysed the transmission risk of SARS on a
flight carrying 120 passengers from Hong Kong to Beijing, and found that the
attack rate reached 18.3%, and the risk to travellers sitting within 3 rows of the
index patient was 3.1 times the risk than other locations 31. Nevertheless, Vogt
et al. (2006) found that no SARS transmission occurred for a study involving 7
flights and 339 interviewees

41

. Therefore, the overall transmission risk of

infectious diseases on confined vehicles with high efficiency air filtration
devices, e.g., airplane and high-speed train, remains unclear, and likely varies
by disease.
Using anonymised individual itinerary and epidemiological data among
confirmed COVID-19 patients and their close contacts on flights and
high-speed trains across mainland China in the early days of the outbreak, we
quantified the transmission risk of SARS-CoV-2 on airplanes and trains across
seat locations and by joint travel (co-travel) time. To account for confounding
relationships between passengers (e.g., family or friends) and their potential

SARS-CoV-2 infections at home or working places before or after travel, we
estimated the upper and lower bounds of transmission risk during the journey.
The number of infected travellers was also estimated to understand the
effectiveness of containment measures implemented across the country. The
findings from this research can provide an improved evidence-base for
tailoring travel interventions to reduce the transmission risk of COVID-19 in
cabins and carriages during the resumption of socioeconomic activities and
public transportation.

Results
COVID-19 prevalence among train and airplane passengers
A total of 9,265 airline passengers on 291 planes and 29,335 passengers on
830 G-trains (max speed 350 km/h) and D-trains (max speed 250 km/h) were
included in this study during the early stage of COVID-19 outbreak in mainland
China, from December 20, 2019 through March 17, 2020 (see data sources
and enrolment criteria in Methods). Among them, 87.6% travelled via airplane
and 96.9% travelled via train before the lockdown in the city of Wuhan on
January 23, 2020 (Figure 1). Eventually, 336 airline travellers and 891 train
passengers were later confirmed as COVID-19 cases within the 1-14 days
following their travel. Further, 69.1% of cases travelling via airplane and 82.7%
of cases travelling via train reported symptom onset before January 23, 2020
(e.g., during travel). However, only a small fraction of cases travelling via
airplane (5.7%) and cases travelling via train (3.1%) had symptom onset after
January 29, 2020, when all provinces of mainland China declared a first-level
public health emergency response.
Attack rate of COVID-19 among passengers departing from Wuhan
175 index cases travelling by airplane were identified, with a further 587 index
cases travelling via high-speed train from Wuhan before lockdown
implementation (Table 1). To account for potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2
outside of the journey among family members or friends who were travelling
together, we designed two assumptions for estimating the upper bound and

lower bound of infection risks during travel, respectively (see Methods). For the
former case, we assumed that all passengers were travelling independently
during the journey, and without any previous contacts outside of the journey. In
the latter assumption, we assumed that the index patient and passengers
seating immediately adjacent to them with the same destinations were family
or friends, and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between them was therefore
more likely to have occurred at home or in the workplace. Therefore,
passengers seating immediately adjacent to an index patient were excluded
from the attack rate (AR) calculation to estimate the potential lower bound of
spreading risk of SARS-CoV-2 in airplanes and trains.
When estimating the upper bound of risk, 34 and 69 close contacts among
passengers were considered to be infected on airplanes and trains departing
from Wuhan, respectively, with an AR of 0.60% (34/5622, 95% confidence
interval [CI] 0.43% - 0.84%) on planes and 0.35% (69/19689, 95%CI 0.28% 0.44%) on trains (Table 1). The AR for high-speed trains was likely lower than
that for airplanes (p = 0.01), with approximately 0.19 (SD 0.45) and 0.12 (SD
0.40) secondary cases per index case (effective reproduction number) during
travel in cabins and carriages, respectively. The median time lag from
departure to symptom onset was 4.0 days (interquartile range [IQR] 3.0 - 7.8)
for airline passengers and 5.0 days (IQR 3.0 - 8.0) for train passengers. When
estimating the lower bound of risk, the AR was 0.33% (18/5400, 95%CI 0.21%
- 0.53%) on airplanes and 0.21% (41/19300, 95%CI 0.16% - 0.29%) on trains,
and each index case infected 0.10 (SD 0.32) and 0.07 (SD 0.29) passengers
on airplanes and high-speed trains, respectively. Additionally, the AR on
high-speed trains was likely lower than that on airplane departing from Wuhan
or other cities in mainland China (Extended Data Table 1) (p < 0.01).
COVID-19 transmission risk by seat locations
The AR varied greatly by seat within three rows and six columns to the index
patient seat (Figure 2). In the upper-bound risk estimation, the seats
immediately adjacent to the index cases had the highest risk, with an AR of 9.2%
(95%CI 5.7% - 14.4%) on airplanes and 3.6% (95%CI 2.5% - 5.3%) on trains.
Compared to other seats, the relative risk (RR) of these seats was 27.8

(95%CI 14.4 - 53.7) on airplanes and 15.7 (95%CI 9.7 - 25.5) on trains.
Generally, passengers seated on the same row as the index case had a higher
risk than passengers at other rows, with a RR of 10.6 (95%CI 5.3 - 21.1) for
airplanes and 8.9 (95%CI 5.5 - 14.3) for trains, respectively. However, ARs for
the seats at one to three rows apart from the index patient showed no
significant difference between each other (p > 0.05).
In terms of seat location on airplanes, i.e., window, middle and aisle seats,
the middle seat had the highest AR (0.7%, 95%CI 0.4% - 1.2%), followed by
the window seat (0.6%, 95%CI 0.3% - 1.0%) and the aisle seat (0.6%, 95%CI
0.3% - 1.0%) for the upper bound estimation, likely due to the fact that middle
seats are exposed to individuals on either side, where window and aisle seats
are exposed to only one individual. For trains, the middle seat also had the
highest AR 0.4% (95%CI 0.3% - 0.8%). No significant difference in AR was
found on seats between Airbus and Boeing airplanes (p = 1.0), and between
G-trains and D- trains (p = 0.64) (Extended Data Table 2).
Effect of co-travel duration on COVID-19 transmission risk
Travel time among airplane passengers ranged from 1.1 to 4.3 hours (mean
2.0, SD 0.5), with approximately 98% travelling less than 3 hours. On average,
the upper bound of AR increased from 0.7% (95%CI 0.5% - 1.0%) to 1.2%
(95%CI 0.4% - 3.3%) when the co-travel time increased from 2.0 hours to 3.3
hours (Extended Data Table 3), while the lower bound estimates of AR
increased from a relatively low risk (0.0%, 95%CI 0.0% - 0.6%) within 1.5
hours, to 0.4% (95%CI 0.02% - 2.2%) for a joint travel duration of 3.3 hours.
However, due to the small number of secondary cases in different groups of
co-travel time intervals, there was no significant difference between the
estimated upper and lower bounds of ARs (p = 0.06).
The travel time of train passengers ranged from 0.2 to 12.6 hours, with a
mean of 2.2 hours (SD 2.0), and 91% passengers travelling less than 5 hours.
Within 3.5 hours’ co-travel, the average ARs had an upper bound of 0.19%
(95%CI 0.1% - 0.3%) and lower bound of 0.1% (95%CI 0.07% - 0.2%). When
the co-travel duration exceeded 3.5 hours, the ARs increased to 0.9% (95%CI
0.7% - 1.3%) and 0.6% (95%CI 0.4% - 0.8%), respectively, which were

significantly higher than the risks within 3.5 hours’ co-travel (p < 0.01), with
RRs of 5.0 (95%CI 3.1 - 8.0) and 4.8 (95%CI 2.6 - 8.8), respectively. The q
index for measuring spatial heterogeneity of risk (see Methods) was 0.33 (p =
0.02), taking the row number and hourly co-travel time as the unit of
stratification.
Impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions
Non-pharmaceutical interventions were widely implemented across China
following Wuhan’s lockdown on January 23, 2020, including measures such as
case detection and isolation, travel restrictions, temperature screening at
airports and train stations, mandatory face coverings, personal hygiene
protection, and more 42,43. As a result, case numbers and passengers travelling
by both airplane and high-speed rail decreased drastically throughout
mainland China, particularly after the implementation of intensive public health
emergence response efforts (i.e., the highest level interventions and travel
restrictions) across China on January 29, 2020 (Figure 1; Extended Data Table
4 and 5).

Discussion
Although many studies have explored the impact of human mobility and
relevant interventions on the spread of infectious diseases

2,3,44

, our study is

the first to quantify the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission among individual
passengers on both airplanes and trains across China. These findings inform
transmission probability estimates of COVID-19 in confined environments,
which may help to formulate targeted strategies to protect travellers and
control long-distance transmission of the disease. Based on individual case
and passenger data on airplanes and high-speed trains, our research showed
that overall transmission risk of SARS-CoV-2 among passengers in the early
days of outbreaks was relatively low via air and rail travel. We further
quantified the relationship between transmission risk and other travel factors,
such as seat distance from an infectious individual and co-travel time.
We found that transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in cabins and carriages might

have occurred, but the overall risk to a given individual was relatively low for
domestic air and train travel, even under upper bound risk assumptions.
Several factors might explain this; firstly, individuals are less likely to travel
after illness onset, in particular severe infections. Secondly, the degree of
infectivity among travellers may vary temporally. For example, some travellers
infected with SARS-CoV-2 might be pre-symptomatic and still in the latent
period of infection, defined as the period between exposure to the virus and
the onset of infectiousness. Thirdly, modern commercial airplanes and
high-speed trains are commonly equipped with high efficiency particulate air
filters (HEPA), which can effectively filter out 99.9% of dust, bacteria and
viruses with a particle size of more than 0.3μm
transmission risk of respiratory infectious diseases

40

, thereby reducing

45-48

. When the air enters

the passenger cabin, it undergoes high temperature disinfection and cooling.
Aircraft cabin air conditioners can complete up to 20 air changes per hour,
reducing the presence of virus-containing droplets and the risk of disease
transmission in the cabin. Towards this, we found that the difference in risk was
not significant by aircraft and train type within our analyses.
Our findings suggest risk varied with joint travel time and seat distance to
the index case, with risk increasing by longer travel time. The effect of co-travel
duration to COVID-19 transmission risk was more obvious among train
passengers than domestic air travel, as there were more passengers travelling
for longer periods of time by high-speed trains across the country. Additionally,
there are several factors which may explain the higher risk we observed
among travellers seated in the same row as index patients. Firstly, droplets
and aerosols produced by the index patient’s talking, coughing, and sneezing
might be more likely to spread within the immediate vicinity, such as the same
row

49,50

. Further, the seat backs between the front and rear rows might

partially block the spread of the virus in the forward and backward positions.
Secondly, each row of seats has an independent air-conditioning exhaust
system that blows air from top to bottom and is filtered away from the bottom of
the seat. This design could reduce the speed of air diffusion to the
surroundings and thereby dilute the virus concentration 32. Thirdly, passengers
in the same row might have more opportunities for social contact, especially if

they are travelling with family members or friends. Lastly, non-pharmaceutical
interventions that were in place across China since late January 2020 have
effectively contained the spread and further transmission of COVID-19 across
the country

42,43

, subsequently reducing the infection risk among travellers.

Further containment measures such as temperature screening at stations or
airports, face mask usage, and travel restrictions for high risk areas might work
synergistically to minimize transmission risk in transit 51.
Despite our findings, other studies have reported a high transmission risk
of other infectious diseases on planes

27,28

. Kenyon et al. (1996) studied the

transmission risk of tuberculosis on an aircraft that flew for 8.5 hours and found
that the attack rate within and outside of two seat rows to the index patient was
30.8% and 3.6%, respectively

34

. Hertzberg and Weiss (2016) analysed the

average risk of SARS, H1N1, measles and other infectious diseases on the
airplane, and concluded that infection risk within and outside of two rows of the
index patient was 6% and 2%, respectively

52

. However, according to the

analysis of data from hundreds of routes in this study, the average AR of
COVID-19 within three rows of the index patient was much lower than that for
other diseases reported in previous results. These findings suggest that the
transmission risks and mechanisms of COVID-19 and other diseases on
airplanes and trains are complicated, accompanied by certain random factors
and super spreader events 19,31,53.
Our study was subject to a variety of limitations. Firstly, due to the limitation
of data availability, we only studied the risk of transmission within three rows (7
rows in total) in front of and behind the index case, and therefore did not
consider possible transmission within a larger scope (including flight and train
crews). However, previous studies showed that the seats within 3 rows to the
index patients had the highest risk

52

. Secondly, as with other similar studies,

we cannot accurately determine when and where the infection occurred due to
recall bias from passenger reported information32. Cases may have been
infected in other places before or after travel, such as in terminals or railway
stations, during the boarding process or even outside the airport and station.
This might overestimate the risk of spreading COVID-19 on planes or trains,
although we accounted for this by employing two scenarios to estimate the

interval of risk. Thirdly, data on usage of personal protective equipment such
as masks and goggles during the flight were not available to account for the
impact of these interventions, although few passengers might use these
measures before January 23, 2020 when the lockdown of Wuhan was in place.
Fourthly, asymptomatic travellers might not be captured in this study, and
transmission risk before the symptom onset might be overlooked. Lastly, the
difference in the size and cabin layout of aircrafts and trains was not
considered in the study, where first class cabins tend to have more space
between passengers than economy cabins. This information should be taken
into account in future research. However, our findings can improve our
understanding of SARS-CoV-2 transmission during travel and support
countries in tailoring interventions to minimize the risk in cabins and carriages
during the resumption of socioeconomic activities and public transportation.

Methods
Data sources
Since the COVID-19 outbreak has been first reported, the national and local
Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) across China have
conducted intensive epidemiological investigations to identify COVID-19 cases
and close contacts as well as their travel history. We included all confirmed
COVID-19 cases who had a travel history of domestic flight or high-speed train
during illness or within 14 days before symptom onset, as of March 17, 2020. A
total of 291 airplanes and 830 high-speed trains with confirmed COVID-19
cases on board were enrolled in this study. The date of travel, flights/trains no.,
seat no., departure and arrival airports or stations of cases and passengers as
potential close contacts were collected to analyse the potential infectious risk
of the disease. To measure the duration of travel, we searched flight timetables
and flight types at the Variflight (www.variflight.com) and the Ctrip
(www.ctrip.com). Railway timetables were obtained from the China Railway’s
booking website (www.12306.cn). The flight dataset contained a total of 291
flights flying between 81 cities from January 4, 2020 to March 14, 2020, of
which Airbus and Boeing accounted for 43.6% (127) and 55.3% (161)
respectively, with 234 flights departing from Wuhan before the lockdown on
January 23, 2020. A description of the dataset of high-speed G (max speed
350 km/h) trains has also been used and detailed in our previous preliminary
study 22, but in this research, we included both G and D (max speed 250 km/h)
high-speed trains that have similar seat arrangement and air-conditioning
filtration system

54

. The high-speed train dataset contained 830 trains,

including 328 (39.5%) D trains and 502 (60.5%) G trains, stopped at 582
stations from December 20, 2019 up until March 17, 2020. Additionally, there
were a total of 506 trains travelled from or stopped by stations in Wuhan before
its lockdown.
Definitions of case and close contact
According to the Diagnosis and Treatment Scheme for COVID-19 released by
the National Health Commission of China 55, a confirmed case was diagnosed

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.21.20248383; this version posted December 22, 2020. The copyright holder for this

with a positive result for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid by real-time reverse
transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay or high-throughput
sequencing of nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens. On an airplane or each
coach of a train, a passenger was defined as an index case if he/she: i) was
confirmed with COVID-19 after the travel; and ii) had symptom onset within 2
days before travel or within 14 days after travel; and iii) had the earliest date of
symptom onset among passengers within 3 rows in the case where there was
more than one case. Passengers within 3 rows of the index case seat were
considered to be close contacts for estimating the upper bound of risk detailed
below. Given an average incubation period of 5 days (range 2-14 days),
secondary COVID-19 cases were defined as cases among close contacts who
had symptom onset within 2 to 14 days later than the index case after travel 56.
The relationship and contacts between passengers were important factors
in determining the transmission risk of COVID-19 on airplanes and trains,
because family members, colleagues or friends frequently co-travel and might
have a higher transmission risk at home or in the workplace, as opposed to
travel

57

. However, individual social network information was not available for

this study. Therefore, to account for group travel among family or friends, we
used two assumptions for estimating the upper bound and lower bound of
infection risks on transport, respectively. For estimating the upper-bound risk,
we assumed that there was no family or friend relationship between travellers,
nor any contacts before and after the journey, to estimate the potential high
risks (upper bound) of SARS-CoV-2 transmission during air and train travel.
For estimating the lower bound of risk, passengers were assumed to be
travelling with their family members or friends if a small group of passengers
included one index COVID-19 patient, and passengers seated immediately
adjacent to this index patient shared the same departure and destination.
Therefore, passengers fitting this definition were excluded from close contacts
of the index patient to estimate the potential low risks (lower bound) of
SARS-CoV-2 spread on airplanes and trains, respectively.
Assessing transmission risks
The attack rate (AR) of a seat was calculated as the number of confirmed

cases divided by the total number of passengers that used the same seat.
Relative risk (RR) and Chi-squared tests were used to compare the risks
between different seats. Fisher’s exact test was used when the Chi-squared
approximation might be incorrect because of small sample sizes. The 95%
confidence interval (CI) of estimated AR was estimated using Wilson's
binomial method. Risk ratio was calculated using Wald’s unconditional
maximum likelihood estimation, and its 95% CI was estimated using Wald’s
normal approximation. The number of secondary cases infected per index
case during travel was also used as an effective reproduction number of
COVID-19 transmission among passengers on airplanes and trains,
respectively. Additionally, to understand the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission
among

travellers

of

non-pharmaceutical interventions in the early days of the outbreak, we focused
on the individual-level transmission risk of COVID-19 among passengers on
domestic flights and high-speed trains, departing from Wuhan before the
lockdown was implemented on January 23, 2020.

Measuring spatial heterogeneity of risk
The seat distance between each close contact and the index case is an
important factor in disease transmission. Wang’s q index was adopted to
measure the spatial heterogeneity in ARs between rows and columns of seats
58,59

. The q index varies between 0 and 1. The closer the q value is to 1, the

stronger the heterogeneity of the spatial distribution of transmission risk.

where N and   stand for the number of seats and the variance of attack rates
for all considered seats, respectively.  and  denote the number of seats
and the variance of attack rates for seats at the ith row, respectively.

Assessing the impact of co-travel time on COVID-19 transmission
The duration of domestic flights departing from Wuhan was mostly around two
to three hours, and generally within four hours. To measure the relationship
between co-travel time with the COVID-19 transmission risk on board, we

grouped the co-travel times of airline passengers with an index case into three
categories: 0 – 1.5 hours, 1.5 – 2.5 hours, and more than 2.5 hours. Similarly,
the duration of co-travel on high-speed train was classified into six groups: 0 –
1.5 hours, 1.5 – 2.5 hours, 2.5 – 3.5 hours, 3.5 – 4.5 hours, 4.5 – 5.5 hours,
and more than 5.5 hours. Chi-squared tests were used to compare the risk
between different co-travel time groups. All statistical analyses in this study
were conducted using R version 4.0.3 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing,
Vienna, Austria).
