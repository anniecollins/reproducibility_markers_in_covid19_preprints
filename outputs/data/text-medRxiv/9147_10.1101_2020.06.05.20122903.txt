In the first quarter of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic brought the world to a

6

state of paralysis. During this period, humanity has seen by far the largest

7

organized travel restrictions and unprecedented efforts and global coordina-

8

tion to contain the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Using large scale human

9

mobility and fine grained epidemic incidence data, we develop a framework

10

to understand and quantify the effectiveness of the interventions implemented

11

by various countries to control epidemic growth. Our analysis reveals the im-

12

portance of timing and implementation of strategic policy in controlling the

13

epidemic. Through our analysis, we also unearth significant spatial diffusion

14

of the epidemic before and during the lock-down measures in several coun-

15

tries, casting doubt on the effectiveness or on the implementation quality of

16

the proposed Governmental policies.

1 Introduction

18

The pandemic due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus (1) has been impacting the world population, health

19

care system and economies over the first half of 2020 (2). Since its identification in December

20

2019 in Wuhan, China, this novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been spreading in China

21

in Jan.-Feb. 2020. The epidemic development was detected in Italy in the second half of

22

February and progressively diffused in the rest of the world. It was declared a global pandemic

23

on March 11, 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO) (3). We have all witnessed and

24

experienced a series of interventions with various levels of confinement measures in different

25

countries and regions, aimed at decreasing the effective reproduction number Rt and controlling

26

the epidemics.

27

Our starting hypothesis is that the development of infected cases, of the various forms of

28

illnesses resulting from infection and of the death rates reflect the interplay between the biolog-

29

ical and epidemiological properties of this new SARS-CoV-2 virus and the political, cultural,

30

sociological and governance characteristics of different nations and human communities. By

31

combining mobility data, epidemiological data and clinical data across ten countries, we de-

32

velop a modelling framework to quantify the effectiveness of the interventions implemented by

33

various countries to control the epidemic growth. This shock provides a real-life natural exper-

34

iment to falsify the effectiveness of different organisations and interventions and policies, with

35

the goal of informing and guiding future plans against potential second and third waves of the

36

epidemics as well as future outbreaks in general.

37

First, we quantify precisely how interventions in the form of mobility restrictions and social

38

distancing have had significant impacts in controlling the development of the epidemics in many

39

countries, as measured by the decrease in reproduction number Rt and the extend of curbing the

40

increase of infected cases. We also document a surprisingly large heterogeneity in the reduction

41

of Rt across regions within a given country and also across countries. Further, we observe non

42

monotonous and fluctuating time dependence of Rt in different regions.

43

Our most surprising result is that, in many regions where the epidemic was not visible, the

44

interventions led to a significant transient increase in reproduction number Rt , in contradiction

45

with the short-term objective of lockdown measures. For instance, in several regions of France

46

and Italy, lockdown led to an obvious strong collapse of mobility, however accompanied by an

47

increase of Rt . We interpret this phenomenon as a result of preemptive large movements of

48

people to relocate before the strict lockdown implementation, hence promoting new contagions

49

and epicenters for the epidemics to mature for a while after the lockdown. Another plausible

50

mechanism, which underlies the Japanese policy, is the effect of closed spaces and close-contact

51

settings within confined households.

52

We also quantify how the timing of lockdown determined the trajectory of the epidemic

53

by estimating the spatial correlation across regions within a country of the total increase of

54

infected cases after the lockdown. In a number of countries, the epidemic started much before

55

the lockdown date and was developing silently as revealed by the strong spatial diffusion of

56

the epidemic after the lockdown. In other countries, the epidemic was better contained by

57

intervention measures.

58

Our analysis overall suggests that the interventions may have not been optimal and that there

59

are probably better alternatives to complete lockdowns. Our study reveals the importance of

60

timing and targeting of interventions as a likely better strategy compared with undifferentiated

61

lockdown. We observe belated intervention at the regional and local levels and hasty global

62

lockdowns, which, in a number of regions, result in disappointing reduction of the reproduction

63

number and curbing of the increase of new cases compared to other comparable countries.

64

2 Results

65

We use a probabilistic contagion model with inhomogeneous source terms to explain the tem-

66

poral evolution of epidemic because of COVID-19 (4). Using the daily number of confirmed

67

cases and the generation time model (see figure (S1)), we estimate the time evolution of effec-

68

tive reproduction number Rt – which is defined as the actual average number of secondary cases

69

per primary case – with a Sequential Bayesian estimation. As a typical result of our analysis,

70

figure 1 shows the time evolution of the effective reproduction number in the Hessen state in

71

Germany.

72

With the help of a diffusion-regression state-space model (5) and MCMC posterior infer-

73

ence, we estimate the counterfactual evolution – that would have occurred had no intervention

taken place – of post intervention effective reproduction number. The comparison between the

75

effective reproduction number and the predicted Rt , had no intervention taken place, allows us

76

to quantify the effectiveness of intervention for the Hessen state in Germany shown in fig. 1. We

77

find an average reduction of Rt of 0.87, and reject the null hypothesis with a p-value of 0.04 that

78

this reduction could result from chance under the counterfactual evolution without lockdown.

79

Figure 2 shows the map of the absolute impact on Rt as a result of intervention for different

80

states in Germany. The color for each state represents the average impact of the intervention on

81

Rt , i.e., the magnitude increment or decrement of Rt from the counterfactual predicted value

82

without lockdown over the thirty days following lockdown. The radial wedges represent the

83

temporal evolution of Rt in the corresponding state and color of the strips represent Rt on a

84

particular day over the thirty days following lockdown. This figure illustrates the significant

85

heterogeneity in the results, as well as an important non-monotonicity in the dynamics of Rt .

86

We then analyse the impact of Governmental interventions on human mobility, illustrating

87

the results for Germany. We are able to breakdown the impact of intervention in different mo-

88

bility dimensions and quantify the level of reduction of mobility (see fig. 3 for details). Figure

89

4 shows the absolute impact on workplace activity (in % change from baseline) in different

90

states in Germany, resulting from the intervention. The radial wedges represent the temporal

91

evolution of the workplace activity in the corresponding state, and color of the strips represent

92

activity on a particular day. Contrary to the map of the absolute impact on Rt (figure 2), the

93

absolute impact of travel restrictions on mobility is much more homogenous across German

94

states, and also consistent along the time axis.

95

We then evaluate the impact of Governmental interventions on Rt as well as on works place

96

activity for the top level administrative divisions in a number of countries. Figure 5 illustrates

97

the impact of Governmental interventions on workplace activity in a number of countries and

98

figure 6 shows the impact on Rt . Each subplot of figure 5 shows the time evolution of mobility

99

and the impact of travel restrictions on mobility of different top level administrative divisions of

100

a country. Each ring map represents a country and provides a visual representation of the time

101

evolution of work place activity as well as the impact of Governmental interventions on the

102

workplace activity. Each subplot of figure 6 shows the time evolution of the effective reproduc-

103

tion number Rt and the absolute impact of travel restrictions on Rt in ten countries. Each ring

104

map represents a country and shows the time evolution of the effective reproduction number Rt

105

as well as the impact of Governmental interventions on Rt . Figure 5 shows a rather homoge-

106

neous impact on workplace activities across the different regions of each of the eight analysed

107

countries. However, there is a large heterogeneity across different countries, e.g. Spain being

108

the most effected country while Japan is the least effected country in terms of workplace ac-

109

tivity. In contrast, the impact on Rt is quite heterogeneous across different regions within a

110

country, notwithstanding similar levels of restriction, as illustrated in figure 6 by Kerala (KL)

111

and Maharastra (MH) in India. Surprisingly, across a number of regions, a significant increment

112

of Rt is observed following the implementation of very strict lockdowns (e.g. Maharastra (MH)

113

in India and Luzern (LU) in Switzerland.).

114

Figure 7 shows the joint distribution (obtained by kernel density estimation) of the absolute

115

impact resulting from intervention on workplace activity and on the Rt in the administrative

116

divisions of nine different countries. In other words, figure 7 compares the strictness of the

117

governmental interventions, measured in terms of the impact on the workplace activity, against

118

the corresponding reduction/increment in effective reproduction number. There is no signifi-

119

cant correlation between these two variables, suggesting that other variables are controlling the

120

reduction of reproduction rates.

121

Figure 8 represents the spatial correlation analysis of the total increase ∆S in the number

122

of confirmed cases during the first 30 days of interventions. We define Moran’s I, which is a

123

measure of spatial auto-correlation, as follows:

P P
N j j wij (∆Si − ∆S̄) ∆Sj − ∆S̄
I=
2
P
W
∆Si − ∆S̄

(1)

i

124

where N is the number of spatial units indexed by i and j in a given country; ∆S is the increase

125

in the number of confirmed cases; ∆S̄ is the mean of ∆S over all the spatial units of the country;

126

wij is a matrix of spatial weights with zeroes on the diagonal (i.e., wii = 0 ); and W is the sum

127

of all wij . We define W by giving a weight 1 if two regions are neighbors, and 0 otherwise.

128

The “spatial lag” of ∆S for a region is defined as the weighted sum of its neighbors’ ∆S.

129

The scatter plot in each panel of figure 8 shows the spatial lag as a function of its corresponding

130

Delta S for different regions in each country. The inset gives the kernel density estimation of the

131

simulated Moran’s I from the null model of no spatial correlation. The slope of the scatter plot

132

of ∆S against the spatial lag is known to converge to the Moran’s I (6). We test the significance

133

of the Moran’s I under the null hypothesis of no spatial auto-correlation and simulate 1000

134

realizations, by randomly shuffling the locations of the ∆S. The spatial correlation analysis

135

presented in figure 8 reveals significant spatial correlation of ∆S in Italy, Switzerland, Japan

136

and United States.

137

In order to understand the effectiveness of lockdowns, we compare the number of confirmed

138

cases against the impact on Rt during the first 30 days of interventions. Figure 9 shows the ker-

139

nel estimation of the bivariate distribution of the total increase in number of cases and of the total

140

impact on Rt during the first 30 days of intervention in different regions of nine countries. The

141

inset in each panel represents the impact on Rt during this period, (or ∆Rt ), against the average

142

Rt before the intervention (or hRt iinit ) over the regions in each country. The kernel density es-

143

timation of the bivariate distribution in figure 9 reveals a negative correlation between the above

144

variables, showing a slowdown of the epidemic growth notwithstanding the increase of Rt . We

145

also compare the average Rt before the intervention (or hRt iinit ) and impact on Rt (or ∆Rt )

146

from the intervention to understand the effectiveness of intervention in reducing/increasing Rt

147

from its initial values. The inset panels of figure 9 unveil a negative correlation between these

148

two variables, indicating a significantly large decrease of Rt in the regions of larger initial Rt .

149

Surprisingly, we also see the extension of the distribution to the second quadrant, revealing the

150

fact that, in many places, the epidemic started after the lockdown.

151

The tables S1 to S10 in the supplementary materials provide the detailed values of Rt with

152

positive and negative impact along with the corresponding growth in total number of confirmed

153

cases as a result of intervention in the different regions for each country. The regions that are

154

characterised by an increase of Rt after lockdown are indicated in bold face.

155

3 Discussion

156

We have found important to quantify the incubation and confirmation periods in order to assess

157

the impact of policy interventions to contain the epidemics in different regions. This quantifi-

158

cation shown in figures 10 and S1 allows us to define a credible time interval over which to

159

quantify the impact of interventions. With this, our analysis provides a framework to under6

160

stand the effectiveness of the policies and interventions implemented by various countries to

161

control the epidemic growth. The wealth of results presented in figures 1-9 leads to the follow-

162

ing insights.

163

Overall, it is clear, and unsurprising, that interventions in the form of mobility restrictions

164

and social distancing are found to have significant impacts in controlling the development of

165

the epidemics in many countries. In particular, we have quantified the decrease in reproduction

166

number Rt resulting from the intervention. As an illustration shown in fig. 1, for the Hessen

167

state in Germany, we are able to quantify that intervention in this state reduced Rt by about 1

168

unit compared with the counterfactual scenario of no intervention.

169

More surprising is the large heterogeneity in the reduction of Rt across different states in

170

Germany, as shown in figure 2. For this country, intervention measures had led systematically

171

to a decrease in Rt , with quite strong differences from state to state. Even more surprising is the

172

time dependence which exhibits a non monotonous and fluctuating behaviour of Rt in different

173

regions.

174

For most of regions in different countries, because of the interventions, Rt decreased, how-

175

ever there are some places where it increased. Because this increase is transient and constrained

176

by the lockdown, it does not lead to a very strong explosion of new cases. A tentative interpre-

177

tation is that, as lockdown was considered and being implemented, in a number of regions, it

178

triggered large movements of people to relocate, hence promoting new contagions and epicen-

179

ters for the epidemics to mature after the lockdown. An additional mechanism, which underlies

180

the Japanese policy, is the effect of closed spaces and close-contact settings within confined

181

households, which has been shown to lead to increased infections within households for in-

182

stance. But because the lockdown only allows the new nucleii of contagion to develop locally,

183

the number of cases did not explode. Examples of this effect can be found in Luzern and

184

Solothurn of Switzerland, in Bremen of Germany, in Saga Ken of Japan and in Odisha of India.

185

This effect that has previously been described qualitatively is given here a quantitative support

186

by our systematic analysis.

187

The observation that lockdown led first to an increase in Rt in a significant number of regions

188

and countries is confirmed by the correlation analysis presented in fig. 9 relating increase of

189

cases to changes of Rt in different countries. There are many regions in each country where

190

there was no epidemics before the lockdown. The lockdown triggered a pre-emptive movement

191

of people to relocate, increasing Rt after the lockdown. But the increase of Rt did not increase

192

∆S too much due to the effect of confinement. The numerous local infectious cases could

193

only infect their immediate relatives. In regions where the epidemic was at more advanced

194

stages, the lockdown had the effect of decreasing Rt , as expected. The insets in fig. 9 provide

195

further support for this conclusion. The average correlations shown by the plots indicate that,

196

where there was no epidemic, the epidemic started after the lockdown, and where there was an

197

on-going epidemic, it came under control.

198

We also quantify that there is not much advantage resulting from strict lockdowns. For

199

example, Japan and Switzerland did rather well in spite of weaker lockdowns, whereas Italy

200

and Spain performed much more poorly with stricter confinements. This is related to the effec-

201

tiveness of early stage contact tracing as well as effective awareness of the role of protection

202

measures. Figure 7 exemplifies this point by showing the paradoxical results that lockdown led

203

to an obvious strong collapse of mobility accompanied by an increase of Rt in several regions in

204

France or Italy, for instance. For the other countries, the effect of lockdown is more as expected.

205

Moreover, the timing of lockdown is very important in determining the trajectory of the epi-

206

demic. Figure 8 shows the spatial correlation of the total growth of epidemic after the lockdown.

207

The larger is the spatial diffusion (possible during the advanced stage of the epidemic), the larger

208

is the spatial correlation. Our analysis shows that, for Italy, Switzerland, the United States, and

209

Japan, the spatial correlation of ∆S is significantly positive. This means that, in these countries,

210

the epidemic started much before the lockdown date and was developing silently as revealed by

211

the strong spatial diffusion of the epidemic. While Switzerland and Japan contained the epi-

212

demic with effective containment policy, Italy and United States failed to do so because the

213

intervention was ill-adapted to the spatial developments.

214

When comparing the German, Swiss and US lockdowns via their mobility data, we find

215

very similar severity levels of the confinements. However, the effectiveness of the lockdown

216

to control the epidemic in the USA is quite low, while very significant in Germany (7) and

217

Switzerland. While Switzerland and USA both imposed the lockdown at a rather late stage of

218

their unfolding epidemic, the Swiss containment and awareness policy was significantly supe-

219

rior to that in the USA. We quantify that the epidemics has diffused to many states in the USA,

220

as revealed by the spatial correlation in figure 8, even after the lockdown was implemented. This

221

explains the failure to reduce the transmission to a large degree. For Italy and Spain, because

222

there was a significant numbers of confirmed cases across different regions of Italy and Spain

223

before the lockdown, it is difficult to determine the effectiveness of cross-region transmission

224

control.

225

In most of the Indian states, we do not observe any significant impact of the lockdown

226

on reducing the effective reproduction number. A possible explanation is that, in most of the

227

places, there is no real epidemic and the majority of the infection cases are found in a small

228

number of states. The complete lockdown of the entire country might have been ignorant to this

229

very strong heterogeneity.

230

We also unearth some outliers, e.g, Maharastra state in India, Saarland in Germany where,

231

despite a strict lockdown (quantified in our analysis by a strong reduction of workplace activity),

232

both the number of cases and Rt exploded. This poses the questions of unobserved contagion

233

paths, likely associated with specific events, perhaps the existence of super-spreaders and so on.

234

Our analysis overall suggests that the interventions may have not been optimal in many

235

countries and that there are probably better alternatives to complete lockdowns. One alterna-

236

tive is a sequential and selective lockdown approach, putting in selective quarantine based on a

237

threshold value for the number of confirmed cases while leaving the other places more open with

238

social distancing but not complete lockdown. One should however stress that this alternative

239

intervention requires very strong testing support in order to determine with sufficient reliability

240

the positive cases. The case of India supports further the idea that the policy was too early in

241

implementing a complete lockdown of the country for such a long time but too late implement-

242

ing effective quarantine of people coming from effected places. The cases of Italy, France and

243

other regions where confinements led to a transient increase of Rt over the following 30 days

244

also underlies the plausible importance of controlling close contacts and confined places: with

245

the aim of doing good, confining might have worsen the transmission of the disease in a number

246

of cases.

4 Materials and Methods

248

4.1

249

4.1.1 Clinical Data

250

Incubation period and confirmation period: To calculate various epidemiological parame-

251

ters, we use the individual-level data (8, 9) on COVID-19 epidemic which are geo-coded and

252

include symptoms, key dates (date of onset, admission, and confirmation), and travel history.

253

The dataset is curated from different sources, including official government sources (official

254

websites of Ministries of Health or Provincial Public Health Commissions), peer-reviewed sci-

255

entific articles, online reports, and news websites. From this database, we select 216 individuals,

256

who got a clinical confirmation for covid-19 and were symptomatic as well as traveled to sus-

257

pected places of exposure. We have the exact dates of travel, onset of symptoms, and of clinical

258

confirmation for these 216 individuals.

259

Serial interval: We use the infector-infectee pairs dataset that has been collected from publicly

260

available information published in research articles and quoted from official reports of outbreak

261

investigations (10). We use 28 probable pairs for the estimation of generation time. For these

262

28 pairs of individuals, the date of illness onset for the pairs of individuals are defined as the

263

date on which a symptom relevant to COVID-19 infection appeared and are determined by the

264

reporting governmental body.

265

4.1.2 Epidemiological Data

266

We collect the daily reported cases at the first administrative level divisions for a list of countries

267

from various sources. The primary sources of information for the datasets are often local news

268

agencies, government reports, WHO reports, various medical communities. Table 1 gives a list

269

of countries with their starting date of the Governmental interventions. There is no lockdown

270

in Japan like other countries, however, prime minister Abe on 7 April, proclaimed a state of

271

emergency. This was the first emergency declaration in Japan and we consider this date as the

272

starting date of intervention.

4.1.3 Mobility Data

274

We use the aggregated anonymised community mobility dataset that has been collected through

275

the Google Maps app (11), to help understand what has changed in response to the Govt. poli-

276

cies aimed at flattening the curve of the COVID-19 pandemic. The dataset is anononymised to

277

ensure that no personal data, including an individual’s location, movement, or contacts, can be

278

derived from the resulting metrics. The anonymization process for the data includes differential

279

privacy (12), with intentionally added random noise to metrics in a way that maintains both

280

users’ privacy and the overall accuracy of the aggregated data (13). The dataset contains the

281

percentage changes of the anonymized mobility metrics of Google users from a baseline based

282

on the historical part.

283

4.1.4 Map Data

284

We collect the geojson files for the first-level administrative divisions of the list of countries

285

containing the names of the regions and the geometry from a number of openly accessible

286

github repositories.

4.2

Models and methodology

288

For our analysis, we select a time span that starts 10 days before the implementation of Govern-

289

mental interventions – for controlling the outbreak, often through mass lockdowns – and ends

290

30 days following the starting date of Governmental interventions.

291

4.2.1 Epidemiological estimations

292

The time between exposure and onset of symptoms is defined as the incubation period. We use

293

a Bayesian framework to model the day of onset of symptoms following the date of exposure to

294

the virus and the day of clinical confirmation of the virus following the date of exposure. Using

295

the key dates for the selected 216 individuals (8, 9), we estimate the important epidemiological

296

parameters like incubation period, confirmation period (the number of days it take to get the

297

clinical confirmation about the virus following the date of exposure). We use the logistic model
P (conf./sympt.|t) =

1
1 + eβt+α

(2)

298

to estimate the cumulative probability distribution of individuals developing symptoms or get-

299

ting the clinical confirmation on the day = t that they are infected, conditional on the fact that

300

the individual was exposed to the virus on day = 0 and will be eventually symptomatic and will

301

get a clinical +ve confirmation result. With the help of Metropolis-Hastings algorithm (14), –

302

a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method (15)– we sample the model parameters (α, β),

303

from a standard normal prior and train our model on the dataset to estimate the posterior proba-

304

bility distribution of developing symptoms or getting the clinical confirmation on the day = t,

305

following the day of exposure on day = 0.

306

4.2.2 Estimation of the time-dependent effective reproduction number Rt

307

The principal epidemiological variable characterizing a disease’s transmission potential is the

308

basic reproduction number, R0 , which is characterized as the estimated number of secondary

309

cases caused by a typical primary case, in an entirely susceptible population. When infection

310

is spreading across a population, working with the effectively reproductive number Rt , which

311

is defined as the actual average number of secondary cases per primary case, is often more

312

convenient. Rt is normally smaller than R0 , which reflects the impact of epidemic controls and

313

the decline of susceptible individuals. The value of Rt is comparable to the branching ratio in

314

the Hawkes process (16, 17), where Rt > 1 can lead to an explosive growth of the epidemic

315

and an ever-increasing number of new cases, while Rt < 1 leads to the eventual demise of the

316

growth process. Provided the branching structure describing who infected whom is determined,

317

it becomes trivial to estimate Rt . However, this information is not generally available and the

318

estimation of Rt then becomes tricky. Nevertheless, recent advances in epidemiology has made

319

it possible to estimate the time evolution of the effective reproduction number (Rt ) through

320

the observed epidemic curve in a geographical region (4, 18). We use the method introduced

321

by (4), which uses the daily number of confirmed cases and a model described below for the

322

generation time (which is one of the key parameters dictating the severity of epidemic growth)

323

to estimate the temporal evolution of effective reproduction number (Rt ) with the help of a

324

Sequential Bayesian estimation approach.

325

The generation time is defined for source-recipient transmission pairs as the time between

326

the infection of the source and the infection of the recipient. Because time of infection is

327

generally not known, the generation time is often approximated by the serial interval, which is

328

defined as the time between the onset of symptoms of the source and the onset of symptoms of

329

the recipient. For the present case, we use the data for the serial intervals from (10), which has

330

been constructed using the publicly available data. We calibrate the data against three models,

331

i.e., Weibull, Log-normal, Gamma distributions to find the best possible approximation model

332

from which the generation time is determined.

333

We use a probabilistic contagion model with in-homogeneous source terms to explain the

334

progression of the COVID-19 epidemic (4). We consider both the human to human transmis-

335

sion and infections from the reservoir (contaminated surfaces) to explain the epidemic growth.

336

Denoting S(t) and N (t) as the average number of susceptible and total population at time t and

337

β and γ −1 as the contact rate and the infectious period, then
R0 =

β
γ

and Rt =

S(t)
× R0 .
N (t)

(3)

338

According to this model, if we denote the number of new infections from the reservoir between

339

t and t + τ by ∆B(t) and the number of new cases within this period by ∆T (t + τ ), then the

340

stochastic discrete variable ∆T (t + τ ) is generated by a probability distribution with average

number of cases given by
∆T (t + τ ) ∼ P {λ}

(4)

λ = ∆B(t + τ ) + b (Rt ) (∆T (t) − ∆B(t) + τ γRt ∆B(t))

(5)

with

343

where P {λ} denotes a discrete probability distribution with mean λ. In eq. (5), b(Rt ) can be

344

expressed as
b(Rt ) = exp [τ γ(Rt − 1)] ,

(6)

345

which is the slope of the tangent at the origin of case trajectories from the epidemic time delay

346

plot (∆(t) vs ∆(t − τ )) of surveillance data. More details about the derivation of the model can

347

be found supplementary material or in (4).

348

We use a Bayesian framework to estimate the full probability distribution for the effective

349

reproduction number Rt , conditional on the time series for new cases. The probability distribu-

350

tion of Rt , compatible with the observed temporal data stream, is given by
P [∆T (t + τ ) ← ∆T (t)|Rt ]P [Rt ]
P [Rt |∆T (t + τ ) ← ∆T (t)] =
,
P [∆T (t + τ ) ← ∆T (t)]

(7)

351

where P [Rt ] is the prior distribution and P [∆T (t + τ ) ← ∆T (t)] is independent of Rt , and is a

352

normalization parameter. From successive applications of Bayes’ theorem, a sequential estima-

353

tion scheme, that uses streaming epidemiological observations performed in real time, can be

354

constructed using the posterior distribution for Rt , at time t as the prior in the next estimation

355

step at time t + τ , leading to an update scheme via iteration of eq. (7). The resulting probability

356

distribution for Rt includes information on all observations up to time t, and thus is a robust

357

estimator of the effective reproduction number compared to the estimation by only considering

358

the cases between t and t + τ . Any changes in Rt over time result from the assimilation of

359

each new data point, leading to an updated estimate of Rt . This in turn allows us the use of the

360

estimation procedure as an anomaly detection tool.

4.2.3 Estimation of the causal impact of Governmental intervention

363

364

of COVID-19. We use the framework proposed by (5) to infer the causal impact on the epidemic

365

progression as well as the human mobility because of various Governmental interventions. The

366

method uses a diffusion-regression state-space model that predicts the counterfactual evolution

367

of effective reproduction number Rt , as well as the mobility metric in a synthetic control that

368

would have occurred, had no intervention taken place. The model is successful in inferring the

369

temporal evolution of attributable impact, and flexibly accommodates multiple sources of vari-

370

ation, including local trends, seasonality and the time-varying influence of contemporaneous

371

covariates by incorporating empirical priors on the parameters in a fully Bayesian framework.

372

Using the MCMC for posterior inference, we estimate the most likely counter-factual evolu-

373

tion of effective reproduction number and the mobility metric during the first 30 days of the

374

interventions.

375
376

According to the model, the generalized Bayesian Structural Time Series – state-space models for time-series data – can be expressed by
yt = ZtT αt + βXt + Gt t ,

(8)

αt+1 = Tt αt + Ht ηt ,

(9)

377

378

where t ∼ N (0, σt2 ) and ηt ∼ N (0, Qt ) are independent of all other unknowns, αt is referred

379

to as a “state” of the series and yt is a linear combination of the states plus a linear regression

380

with the covariates X. Eq. 9 is the state equation governing the evolution of the state vector

381

αt through time, whereas yt is a scalar observation. It is possible to model several distinct

382

behaviors for the time series (including ARM A or ARIM A) by varying the matrices ZtT , Tt ,

383

Gt , Qt and Ht .

384

Here, we simplify (9) by taking Tt = Ht = 1, so that
αt+1 = αt + ηµ,t

(10)

385

is a simple random walk, also referred to as the “local level” component. This random walk

386

component embodies the increasing uncertainty of observations as time passes. In (8), we take

387

ZtT = Gt = 1 but augment the equation by accounting for the possible presence of seasonal

388

components embodied into γt described below. This allows us to reduce expression (8) into
yt = αt + γt + βXt + t .

The linear dependence on the covariates βXt in eq. (11) further helps to explain observed data.

391

The better this component contributes to the prediction task, the lower the local level component

392

µt should be. Finally, t ∼ N (0, σt2 ) models the noise associated with measuring yt .

393

In order to estimate the impact of Governmental interventions, we follow the following

394

methodology. During the training period, we sample the model parameters and the state vector

395

using the Gibbs sampler – a MCMC framework – against the observed data. For the estimation

396

of the impact on the mobility metric, the training period extends over the first 10 days in our

397

selected dataset, i.e, from 10 days prior to the start of Governmental intervention to the start

398

of the intervention. For the estimation of the impact on the effective reproduction number, the

399

training period extends over the first 20 days in our selected dataset, i.e, from 10 days prior and

400

10 days following the start of Governmental intervention. We select this span of time since,

401

for almost 50% of the people, it takes at least 9.92 days following the date of exposure to get a

402

clinical confirmation of the viral infection (see fig. 10 for the Hessen state in Germany). Hence,

403

on average, there is a delay of around 10 days between the date of exposure and the date of

404

confirmation, and there will not be any immediate effect on the the daily confirmed cases as

405

a result of the intervention. Thus, we define the estimated effective intervention date as being

406

equal to the exact intervention date plus 9.92 ≈ 10 days. We then use the posterior simulations

407

to simulate from the posterior predictive distribution over the counterfactual time series given

408

the observed pre-intervention activity during the training. We use the following 30 days for

409

mobility metric and following 20 days for the effective reproduction number for this purpose.

410

Finally, we use the posterior predictive samples to compute the posterior distribution of the

411

point wise impact, i.e, φt = yt − ỹt , where yt is the observed quantity and ỹt is the counterfactual

413

expected value of the point wise impact i.e, I = hφt it . We use the 30 days and 20 days of

posterior predictive samples for mobility metric and Rt to estimate the point wise impact as

Figure 5: Time evolution of mobility and impact of travel restriction on mobility in eight
countries. Each subplot shows the time evolution of mobility and impact of travel restrictions
on mobility of different top level administrative divisions of a country. The countries are, for top
left to bottom right: Switzerland, Japan, France, Italy, Spain, Canada, USA and India. The color
of the regions on the map denoted by their ISO 3166-2 code represent the impact (increase or
decrease of mobility) of travel restriction on that region. The radial connected wedges represent
the time evolution of the mobility in the corresponding region or state for each country. The
color of the strips in the wedges represent the mobility on a particular day.

Figure 7: Impact of travel restrictions on workplace activity and on epidemic progression (Rt ) in nine countries. Each panel represents the bivariate kernel density estimation as a
function of the absolute impact on workplace activity and impact on Rt in the administrative
divisions of each country. The bivariate distribution is constructed over the set of regions within
each country. The top and right inset of each of the nine plots represent the marginal distribution
of the respective variables for each country. The countries are, from top left to bottom right:
India, Japan, USA, Spain, Switzerland, Germany, Italy, Canada and France.

Figure 8: Spatial auto-correlation of the total increase ∆S in number of confirmed cases
during the first 30 days of intervention in nine countries. In each panel, the x-axis corresponds to the value of ∆S in a given region in a given country; the y-axis gives the average
∆S over the neighboring regions, called “spatial lag” in the caption along the y-axis. These
two variables are z-standardised for better comparison. The inset in each panel represents the
Kernel Density estimator for the distribution of the simulated Moran’s I. The black vertical line
in the inset represents the expected Moran’s I from simulations with the null hypothesis of no
spatial correlations. The red vertical line represents the value obtained from empirical data.
Moran’s I along with its p-value is given in yellow box. The countries are, from top left to
bottom right: Italy, Switzerland, Spain, India, Japan, USA, Germany, Canada and China.

Figure 9: Joint distribution of the total number ∆S of confirmed cases within the first 30
days of intervention and of the absolute impact of intervention on the effective reproduction number (∆Rt ) within this period. Each panel represents the Kernel Density Estimation
for the total number of confirmed cases within the first 30 days of the intervention against the
impact of interventions on effective reproduction number (∆Rt ) in different administrative divisions of a country. The bivariate distribution is constructed over the set of regions within each
country. The yellow box contains the Kendall τ correlation value for this joint distribution. The
inset in each panel represents the variation of ∆Rt during the intervention against the average
initial Rt before the intervention. The yellow box gives the corresponding Kendalls τ ’s. The
countries are, from top left to bottom right: Italy, USA, Spain, Japan, Germany, China, India,

Figure 10: Bayesian inference of the incubation period and confirmation period. A) Empirical cumulative probability of developing a symptom on a particular day following the day
of exposure to the virus. We use individual level clinical data (8, 9) to conduct these Bayesian
estimations. The lighter color of the square represents low probability and the deep color represents high probability. The solid lines represent the fraction of people remaining asymptomatic
(decreasing curve) or becoming symptomatic (increasing curve) on a given day. following exposure. The inset figure represents the empirical probability distribution of duration between
the date of exposure and the date of onset of symptom or the clinical confirmation. B) Same
as A) but for the probability of being confirmed. C) Estimation of the posterior probability
distribution (with 95% confidence interval) of the incubation period (i.e., of getting the clinical
confirmation on day = t, provided the individual is exposed to the virus on day = 0). The
dashed solid line represents the most likely posterior probability estimation and the light band
represent the 95% confidence interval. The inset figure presents the distributions of the two
estimated parameters in the logistic model (2). D) Same as C) for the probability distribution of
confirmation period. The median value (and also mode) of the incubation period is 4.38 days.
The median value (and also mode) tc of the confirmation period is 9.94 days.

Figure S1: Generation time distribution: The distribution of the serial intervals are calibrated
with 3 different models, i.e, Gamma, Log-normal and Weibull and using maximum likelihood
estimation. We find the most suitable model for the generation time distribution by comparing
the log-likelihood scores of the above models. We observe that the log-normal distribution gives
the best fitting with µ = 4.6 and σ = 2.8. The grey bars represents the empirical observations
and the three fitted models are presented as solid lines.
