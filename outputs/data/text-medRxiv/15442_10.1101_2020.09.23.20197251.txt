Abstract
The Nucleocapsid Protein (N Protein) of severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV2) is located in the viral core. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) targeting N protein is
detectable in the serum of infected patients. The effect of high titers of IgG against N-protein on
clinical outcomes of SARS-CoV2 disease has not been described. We studied 400 RT-PCR
confirmed SARS-CoV2 patients to determine independent factors associated with poor
outcomes, including MICU admission, prolonged MICU stay and hospital admissions, and inhospital mortality. We also measured serum IgG against the N protein and correlated its
concentrations with clinical outcomes. We found that several factors, including Charlson
comorbidity Index (CCI), high levels of IL6, and presentation with dyspnea were associated with
poor clinical outcomes. It was shown that higher CCI and higher IL6 levels were independently
associated with in-hospital mortality. Anti-N protein IgG was detected in the serum of 55 (55%)
patients at the time of admission. A high concentration of antibodies, defined as signal to cut off
ratio (S/Co)> 1.5 (75 percentile of all measurements), was found in 25 (25%) patients. The
multivariable logistic regression models showed that between being an African American, higher
CCI, lymphocyte counts, and S/Co ratio> 1.5, only S/Co ratio were independently associated
with MICU admission and longer length of stay in hospital. This study recommends that titers of
IgG targeting N-protein of SARS-CoV2 at admission is a prognostic factor for the clinical course
of disease and should be measured in all patients with SARS-CoV2 infection.

Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its resultant disease,
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID19), has spread rapidly since its first report in Wuhan, China,
to become a public health threat of global importance 1,2. According to the World Health
Organization, there are over 30 million cases worldwide as of September 16th 2020, with the
United States accounting for 6.6 million cases and over 196,000 deaths alone. This prolific virus
is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA belonging to the Betacoronavirus genus.
SARS-CoV-2 has four key structural proteins. The Nucleocapsid Protein (N Protein) is found in
the viral core3. The Spike Protein (S Protein), Matrix Protein (M Protein) and Envelope Protein
(E Protein)3 are all found on the virus’s outer surface. The S Protein is a key determinant in the
viral host range and possibly infectivity4. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) developed against the S
protein is believed to be a neutralizing antibody immune response and is currently the primary
target for COVID19 vaccine trials. The M protein is the most abundant protein on the viral
surface and is believed to play a role in viral budding from the host cell membrane5,6. The E
protein is the smallest protein whose function is poorly defined, but it is thought to contribute to
intracellular viral trafficking and viral protein assembly7.
Although the functionality of the N protein is not well understood, it has been well studied in
SARS-CoV1 8. The N protein is closely associated with viral RNA structure and function and
plays a vital role in viral transcription and assembly while functioning as an RNA chaperone9.
The N segment of the RNA has 3 distinct regions; a motif responsible for length of amino acids
of N protein, a sumoylation motif (lysin residue), and a serin residue responsible for
phosphorylation by a cyclin-dependent kinase complex 8.

A neutralizing antibody (Ab) may block interaction of a virus protein with the host receptor 10.
However, a non-neutralizing Ab may even complicate the pathogenesis of some viral infections

by antibody dependent enhancement (ADE). ADE is a phenomenon that is well described in
viral infections, including Coronavirus 11. ADE represents a paradoxical Ab effect where the
virus uses the antibodies to gain access to host immune cells. Specifically, the virus uses nonneutralizing Ab to attach to immune cells, replicate within macrophages and cytotoxic T cells,
and consequently worsen the infection through cytotoxic effects on the host immune cells 12.
ADE is also associated with higher viremia 13. Non-neutralized viral particles may also lead to
the extensive release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the inhibition of anti-inflammatory
cytokines causing immunopathology 12.
An ongoing debate in the medical community concerns the impact of ADE on SARS-CoV-2
infection and if ADE is contributing to the current pandemic. One possible factor leading to the
trend of poorer prognosis with age may be previous exposure to various strains of Coronavirus,
making the host more susceptible to ADE.
The N protein of SARS-CoV2 has high homology with other highly pathogenic members of the
coronavirus family, with a molecular weight of about 46-kDa 14. Previous exposure could lead to
the production of non-neutralizing Abs and establish an overwhelming pro-inflammatory state
through ADE15. Patients who have higher levels of non-neutralizing IgG early in their disease
may experience a worse infection due to ADE.
We hypothesize that IgG Abs against the N protein may be associated with the ADE
phenomenon and higher levels of viremia. Elevated levels of coronavirus anti- N protein IgG
may be associated with poorer outcomes such as increased length of hospitalization, increased
likelihood of ICU admission, increased length of ICU admission, and increased mortality during
hospitalization. To test these hypotheses, we conducted a prospective study on RT-PCRconfirmed COVID19 patients admitted to the University of Miami Hospital to determine clinical
factors associated with poor outcomes. In addition, this study aimed to determine the
association between serum SARS-CoV2 anti-N protein IgG levels and clinical outcomes of

COVID19 disease. Further, we performed RT-PCR on RNA extracted from the whole blood of
subjects with negative, low, and high concentrations of IgG for N-protein to detect viremia.
Materials and Methods
Ethics Statement
This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the University of Miami.
Study population
Patients who were seen in the emergency room (ER) or admitted to COVID19 units of
University of Miami Hospital from March to the end of June 2020 were consented and enrolled
in this study.
Study design and sampling of peripheral blood
The study population included individuals admitted to the University of Miami Hospital with
COVID19 infection confirmed via RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs. Four hundred RT-PCR
confirmed COVID19 patients were enrolled. Out of the 400 COVID-19 patients, 100 were
consented to participate in the COVID19 biobank. Figure 1 shows the study algorithm. Serum
samples were used to measure IgG against N-protein and whole blood was used for SARSCoV2 RT-PCR.
All 100 serum samples were enrolled for IgG measurement. The single to cut off (S/Co) ratio
was measured for all samples.
Fifteen patients were randomly selected for whole blood RNA extraction. Five patients with high
IgG titers (defined as S/Co ratio >1.5), 5 with positive IgG but S/Co ratio<1.5, and 5 with
undetectable IgG levels were selected at enrollment.
Peripheral blood samples were collected following enrollment and processed by centrifugation
at 1800 g for 30 minutes. Serum and whole blood were aliquoted into 2 ml cryogenic tubes and
stored at –80 C immediately for later analysis.

Demographic, clinical, and outcome data were collected from the electronic medical record
system for each patient. Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) was calculated using the
comorbidities and age data for each patient. The main outcomes were ICU admission, length of
stay in ICU, and in-hospital mortality. In-hospital mortality was defined as death occurring during
the hospital stay.
ELISA test
Serum samples were processed and analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies and anti Nprotein IgG levels using an ELISA kit for IgG by Epitope Diagnostics 16 according to
manufacturer’s protocol. Cut off values for positive tests were determined by the manufacturer’s
formula [1.1 X (xNC + 0.18)].17 Signal to cut-off ratio was calculated for each sample.
RNA Isolation
RNA isolation from whole blood samples was performed by using a kit from ZymoResearch
(Orange, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's recommendations.
RT-PCR
The Express Gene SARS-CoV2 RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel was used to detect SARS C on
extracted RNA from blood samples. The Express Gene SARS-CoV2 RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel
is authorized for COVID-19 detection by the FDA (EUA200423). To prevent contamination, all
reagents were prepared in a PCR amplicon-free workstation. All RNA samples and components
were kept on ice during use. The TaqPad Combo kit was used for detection of N gene, S gene
and ORF1ab targets on COVID-19 tests. One Positive Control (1 × 104 copies/μL) and one
Negative Control were included on the RT-PCR plate. RNA samples were thawed on ice, then
2.5 microliter RNA samples containing 15 ng total RNA were used for RT-PCR master mix
together with primer and probes. One-step RT-PCR reaction mix (ThermoFisher) was used for
RT-PCR reaction. All samples were run in triplicate. The Express Gene SARS-CoV2 RT-PCR
Diagnostic Panel can detect quantities as low as 2 copies of N gene, 4 copies of ORF1ab, and

10 copies of S gene from COVID-19 viral genome per reaction volume. This information is part
of our approved FDA Emergency Use Authorization (EUA200423) and can be found on the FDA
website.

Statistical Analysis
Categorical variables were presented as numbers and percentages and examined with the
Mantel-Haenszel test. Continuous variables were compared using Student T-test (normally
distributed) and Wilcoxon rank-sum (non-normally distributed) variables. A univariate analysis
was subsequently performed to compare differences in categorical and continuous variables for
each outcome. To determine risk factors for each outcome, a multivariable analysis was
performed using a stepwise logistic regression model. Cox regression was performed to
determine risk factors associated with in-hospital mortality. Clinically relevant factors were found
based on our and other studies and added into the models 18-21. We used the Charlson
comorbidity index because we expected a low number of outcomes for each outcome variable
and were able to include only a limited number of potential confounders from the comorbidities
in the model (CCI) 22. The statistical significance was accepted when the p value was less than
0.05. Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS version 26.
Results
A total of 400 patients were diagnosed with COVID19 infection during the study period. The
demographic and clinical data of patients are reported in supplementary Table S1. Emergency
physicians admitted 248 (62%) of the patients and the rest were discharged.
Among the patients who were admitted to the hospital, the mean (SD) age was 63 (17.2) years
old and 141 (57%) were male, 147 (61%) were White, while 65 (44.4%) of them were White
Hispanic. Sixty-two (24.5%) of admitted patients were African American and the rest multiracial.

During hospitalization, 76 (30%) patients were admitted to the MICU. In univariant analysis,
patients were found to be more likely to be admitted to the MICU if they were on chemotherapy,
had consolidation or bilateral opacities in chest images, or had laboratory findings of higher
leukocyte counts, lower platelet counts, higher levels of BUN, serum IL6, CRP, LDH, or lower
serum albumin levels(Table S2). Patients presenting complaints of dyspnea, fever, abdominal
pain (but not chest pain) were more likely to be admitted to the MICU (Tables S3). The mean
CCI was higher in patients admitted to the MICU compared to non-MICU patients, 3.67 vs 2.99
(P=0.047), respectively. Patients with diabetes mellitus (OR=2.4) had higher risk for admission
to MICU. Patients admitted to the MICU had higher odds of in-hospital death (OR = 7.85).
Among CRP levels, IL6 levels, CCI, and dyspnea, only dyspnea was found to be independently
associated with increased risk of admission to the MICU, using the multivariable logistic
regression model. (Table 1).
A total of 30 (26%) patients died during hospitalization. Univariant analysis associated the
following with higher mortality: advanced age; nursing home residency; higher CCI; a history of
HTN, HF, CAD, AMS, or DM; use of ACE2 medications before admission; presentation with
chest images containing consolidations with high levels of WBC, IL6, BUN, LDH; admission to
the MICU; and need for noninvasive ventilation (NIV) (Tables S4, S5). The Cox regression
model for in-hospital mortality showed that between CCI, high concentrations of LDH and IL6,
using ACE inhibitors before admission, only CCI and IL6 were independently associated with inhospital mortality (Table 2).
Serum IgG analysis
Out of the 248 patients admitted with COVID-19, 100 consented to participate in the serology
study. The mean (SD) age was 63 (16.9) with a median of 64, and 49 (49.5%) were male. 61
(62%) were White, while 50 (82%) were White Hispanic.

Anti-N protein IgG was positive in 55 (55%) patients at the time of admission. Tables 3 and 4
show the demographic and clinical data of the study population.
In univariate analysis, an S/Co ratio greater than 1.5 was found to be associated with increased
likelihood of admission with symptoms of dyspnea (p=0.01, OR= 4.57) and cough (p=0.041,
OR= 3.10). Patients with S/Co ratio >1.5 were more likely to have bilateral infiltrates on
admission (p=0.036, OR= 2.87). There was a significant difference (p=0.035) in mean
hematocrit percentage in patients with an S/Co ratio > 1.5 (M= 35.40 ± 7.63) vs those with lower
S/Co ratio (M=38.98 ± 6.81). There were also significant (p=0.017) differences in albumin levels
for patients who had an S/Co ratio > 1.5 (3.67 ± 0.50 g/dl) and those who did not (3.35 ± 0.53
g/dl). There were also significant (p=0.022) differences in mean lymphocyte levels for patients
with an S/Co > 1.5 (2.42 ± 4.90 x103 cells/ml) and patients who did not have an S/Co > 1.5 (1.06
± 0.67 x 103 cells/ml). S/Co ratio > 1.5 was associated with increased likelihood of ICU
admission (p=0.047, OR=2.63 days). S/Co >1.5 was also associated with increased likelihood
of staying in the hospital for more than 16 days (p=0.006, OR= 4.06) and MICU stays of more
than 8 days (p=0.004, OR= 32.50) (Table 4). There was a significant correlation between IgG
S/Co ratio and days in MICU as shown in Figure 2.
The multivariable logistic regression model for MICU admission showed that between African
American, CCI, lymphocyte counts, and S/Co ratio> 1.5, only S/Co ratio were independently
associated with MICU admission (Table 5). In multivariable analysis for hospital stays of more
than 16 days, S/Co ratio>1.5 (p=0.047, OR:2.63) was again the only independent factor among
factors the mentioned variables (p=0.006 OR:4.1) (Table 6).

The RT-PCR reaction indicated undetermined levels of N gene, S gene, and ORF1ab
nucleotides sequences on prepared RNA samples from subjects with negative, low, and high
concentrations of IgG. RT-PCR data is shown in the supplemental Excel file.
Discussion
This study indicates that elderly males with COVID19 and a higher number of comorbidity
scores were more likely to be admitted to the hospital. Among hospitalized patients, we found
only high levels of dyspnea independently predicted MICU admission. We also demonstrated
that higher CCI and higher IL6 levels were independently associated with in-hospital mortality.
COVID19-confirmed patients admitted to the hospital for hypoxemia are likely to have
developed a high concentration of IgG against the N protein of SARS-CoV2. High IgG levels are
associated with a higher risk of admission to the MICU and a more extended stay in the
hospital. We also found no evidence of viremia in our hospitalized COVID19 patients.
The present investigation is the first to report an association of high concentration of IgG against
the N protein with poor outcome in COVID19. Prior studies reported detectable levels of total
IgG in COVID19 patients in the first week of the disease23,24. We found that a high concentration
of IgG against N-protein caused a 3-fold increase in risk of admission to the MICU. It could be
theorized that N protein IgG may favor a higher inflammatory response during infection.
Neutralizing Abs are usually produced against viral entry proteins 25-27. The IgG against intact S
protein or the S1 subunit of S protein is accepted as a neutralizing antibody against SARS and
COVID19 28-30. The IgG targeting S protein is likely protective, and it has become the primary
target for COVID19 vaccine development 31. There is no evidence to suggest that S protein IgG
(via vaccine or passive IgG infusion) induces lung pathology via the ADE effect 32. Although the
potential role of ADE in COVID19 remains unknown, the current study suggests that the IgG
levels of non-neutralizing nucleoprotein may be a reason for poor outcomes in COVID19
subjects. The high levels of non-neutralizing IgG for N protein might play a role as a Trojan

Horse for SARS-CoV2 and facilitate virus entry to immune cells with attachment to fragment
crystallizable (Fc) regions of lymphocytes, dendritic cells, macrophages, natural killer cells, and
even platelets. The infected immune cells respond with cytokine production, and autophagy 33.
Interestingly, a higher rate of reported pulmonary embolism and thrombosis in patients with
severe COVID19 34-36 may be attributed to platelet activation after direct infection with the virus
and secondary autophagy 37,38.
Another possible pathologic mechanism could be antibody-mediated cellular cytotoxicity in
infected cells expressing N protein particles in the cell wall. Natural killer cells, neutrophils, and
macrophages interact with IgG and eliminate the target cells 39-41. Immune complex
development against N protein is a fascinating potential mechanism. Berger and his colleagues
showed that the immune complex induces IL6 secretion by immune cells and activates a
network of proinflammatory cytokines and profound systemic inflammatory response 42. Immune
complex against N protein may contribute to the hyperinflammatory response that has been
reported in COVID19 43.
The role of ADE in the pathogenesis of dengue has been reviewed previously 44. In animal
models studying the pathogenesis of the dengue virus, ADE was associated with higher viremia
45-47

. However, the current study suggests that the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV2 is not

correlated with higher ADE-associated viremia. Our observation may suggest that SARS-CoV2
might stay in the lymphatic system and avoid the bloodstream. Further investigation is urgently
needed to confirm our findings.
The major limitation of our study is that we did not measure total non-neutralizing IgG and nonneutralizing anti-S and other proteins. In addition, we were unable to show the effect of IgG
targeting N protein on mortality of COVID19 patients in the multivariable analysis due to sample
size limitations. This study has not yet been validated in another cohort of COVID19 patients.

Further investigation is urgently needed to assess the pathologic mechanisms of IgG for Nprotein in severe COVID19. In particular, a larger multicentric study should be conducted to
investigate the role of IgG targeting N protein on COVID19 mortality. A better understanding of
the role of ADE in platelet activation may shed light on the hypercoagulable state in COVID19
and generate new therapeutic modalities.
In summary, this study recommends that during the initial assessment of patients with
COVID19, IgG targeting N-protein of SARS-CoV2 should be included among the measures. The
high concentration of this immunoglobulin may predict poor outcomes, although further
validation is needed.
