ABSTRACT

22

Background: On March 15, 2020 Puerto Rico implemented non-pharmaceutical

23

interventions (NPIs), including a mandatory curfew, as part of a state of emergency

24

declaration to mitigate the community transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The strict

25

enforcement of this curfew was extended through May 25, with a gradual relaxation

26

beginning on May 1. This report summarizes an assessment of these early mitigation

27

measures on the progression of COVID-19 in the island.

28

Methods and Findings: From March 15 to May 15, 2020, 41,748 results of molecular

29

(RT-PCR) tests were reported to the Puerto Rico Department of Health. Of these, 1,866

30

(4.5%) were positive, corresponding to 1,219 individuals with COVID-19 included in the

31

study. We derived the epidemic growth rates (r) and the corresponding reproductive

32

numbers (R) from the epidemic curve of these 1,219 individuals with laboratory-

33

confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 using their date of test collection as a proxy for

34

symptoms onset. We then compared the observed cases with the R-based epidemic

35

model projections had the mitigation measures not been implemented. Computations

36

were conducted in the R packages forecast, incidence and projections.

37

The number of daily RT-PCR-confirmed cases peaked on March 30 (84 cases),

38

showing a weekly cyclical trend, with lower counts on weekends and a decreasing

39

secular trend since March 30. The initial exponential growth rate (r) was 17.0% (95% CI:

40

8.4%, 25.6%), corresponding to a doubling of cases every 4.1 days, and to a

41

reproduction number (Ro) of 1.89 (95% CI: 1.41, 2.39). After March 30, the r value

reverted to an exponential decay rate (negative) of -3.6% (95% CI: -5.7%, -1.4%),

43

corresponding to a halving of cases every 19.4 days and to an Ro of 0.90 (95% CI:

44

0.84, 0.97). Had the initial growth rate been maintained, a total of 18,699 (96%CI:

45

4,113, 87,438) COVID-19 cases would have occurred by April 30 compared with 1,119

46

observed.

47

Conclusions: Our findings are consistent with very effective implementation of early

48

non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) as mitigation measures in Puerto Rico. These

49

results serve as a baseline to assess the impact of the transition from mitigation to

50

containment stages in Puerto Rico.

Introduction

55

A novel coronavirus designated SARS-CoV-2 has been associated with coronavirus

56

disease 2019 (COVID-19). The disease spectrum ranges from asymptomatic infections,

57

mild-to-moderate influenza-like illness, pneumonia, severe acute respiratory distress,

58

hyperinflammatory state, coagulopathy, to death.1,2,3 First described in late 2019 in

59

China, this novel virus rapidly spread for person-to-person and cases were identified in

60

other provinces and 19 additional countries. By January 30, 2020, the World Health

61

Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global health emergency.4 With

62

the rapid spread of this condition to a total of 113 countries, WHO Director General

63

declared a global pandemic on 11 March 2020.5

64

In the absence of safe and effective vaccine or other therapeutic modalities against

65

SARS-CoV-2, early measures in China included the implementation of non-

66

pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) aimed at temporizing the spread, illness, and

67

deaths due to COVIV-19.6 Similar interventions have been implemented in other

68

countries; NPIs had previously been successfully used to mitigate the 1918-1919

69

influenza pandemic.7 In the United States and Territories, the President and Governors

70

declared health emergencies to implement NPIs, including orders to stay at home,

71

travel restrictions, and closure of nonessential businesses.8

72

On March 13, 2020 the first confirmed COVID-19 cases were identified in Puerto Rico.9

73

These were two tourists from Italy (ages 68 and 70), and a 71-year-old Puerto Rican

74

with lymphoma and diabetes, whose relatives had recently traveled to Chicago, Illinois.

75

Within the past 30 months Puerto Rico had experienced several major natural disasters,

76

including hurricanes Irma and Maria in September 2017 with widespread interruption of

77

the infrastructure for essential services. By late December 2019 and January 2020, the

78

island experienced significant earth tremors and multiple aftershocks with extensive

79

structural damage and housing instability in the Southwest, associated with limited

80

health care access among vulnerable populations.10,11,12 Against this backdrop, on

81

March 15, 2020, the Governor of Puerto Rico issued an island-wide mandatory curfew

82

as part of a state of emergency declaration closing public and private schools and

83

universities, all nonessential businesses and public agencies. By then, five COVID-19

84

cases had been confirmed. The curfew, and its strict enforcement, were extended

85

through May 25, with a gradual relaxation beginning on May 1.

86
87

Methods

88

Using FDA-approved laboratory tests under Emergency Use Authority (EUA), all

89

molecular tests by real-time polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR) were conducted in

90

approximately 900 laboratories throughout the island from March 15 through May 15,

91

2020 and reported to the Puerto Rico Department of Health. All positive RT-PCR test

92

results were de-duplicated to account for individuals who had more than one clinical

93

specimen submitted for testing, and to accurately derive the number of individual

94

COVID-19 cases over time (by date of sample collection). Using the epidemic curve, we

95

compared the pre- and post- estimates of the epidemic growth rate (r) and its

96

corresponding reproductive number (Ro) by March 30, two weeks after the mandatory

97

curfew was implemented. Deaths were included for analysis through May 22 to account

for the censoring effect in the registration of recent deaths. Results of a comprehensive

99

retrospective cohort study of close contacts in Shenzhen, China, were used to impute

100

the serial interval distribution (mean=6.3 days, SD=4.2).13 Computations were

101

conducted in the R packages forecast, incidence and projections.14

103

Results

104

Among residents of Puerto Rico, a total of 46,093 results of molecular (RT-PCR) tests

105

were reported to the Puerto Rico Department of Health between March 15 and May 15.

106

Of these, 1,991 (4.3%) were positive, corresponding to 1,256 individuals with COVID-

107

19. Demographically, 50.5% were male with a mean age of 45.9, and 49.5% female

108

with a mean age of 45.5.

109

The number of daily RT-PCR confirmed cases peaked on March 30 (84 cases),

110

showing a weekly cyclical trend, with lower counts on weekends and a decreasing

111

secular trend since March 30 (Figure 1). The initial exponential growth rate (r) was

112

17.0% (95% CI: 8.4%, 25.6%), corresponding to a doubling of cases every 4.1 days,

113

and to a reproduction number (Ro) of 1.89 (95% CI: 1.41, 2.39).

114

After March 30, the r value reverted to an exponential decay rate (negative) of -3.6%

115

(95% CI: -5.7%, -1.4%), corresponding to a halving of cases every 19.4 days and to an

116

Ro of 0.90 (95% CI: 0.84, 0.97). Had the initial exponential growth rate been

117

maintained, a total of 18,699 (96%CI: 4,113, 87,438) COVID-19 cases would have

118

occurred by April 30 compared with 1,119 observed (Figure 2). A more conservative

120

Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model (0,1,0) shows that 6,294 (95%CI: 5,575;

121

7,013) cases would have occurred in the same period.

122

Throughout the observation period, the total number of RT-PCR tests per day fluctuated

123

but trended to a lower proportion of positive results (from 16.2% in the first two weeks to

124

1.7% in the last two weeks of the study period).

125

A total of 132 COVID-19 deaths were reported from March 15 through May 22, 2020. Of

126

these, 115 (87.1%) had RT-PCT test performed, 55 (41.7%) were laboratory confirmed

127

and 77 (58.3%) had COVID-19 as a probable cause of death; 56.7% were male with a

128

median age of 70.5, and 43.3% were female with a median age of 78.0.

129

The daily COVID-19 deaths peaked on April 13, 2020 (6 deaths). As illustrated in

130

Figure 3, the initial exponential growth rate (r) of COVID-19 deaths was 5.9% (95% CI:

131

3.2%, 8.6%), corresponding to a doubling of deaths every 11.8 days. After April 13, the r

132

value reverted to an exponential decay rate (negative) of -2.7% (95%CI: -4.3%, -1.3%),

133

corresponding to a halving of cases every 25.0 days. An estimated additional 510

134

(95%CI: 130, 890) COVID-19 deaths would had occurred by May 22 if the initial

135

exponential growth of 5.9% had not been curbed.

136
137

Discussion

138

Our findings are consistent with the use of NPIs as very effective early COVID-19

139

mitigation measures in Puerto Rico. It is likely that detection of COVID-19 cases

140

remains under ascertained on the island, as suggested by the relatively high crude

141

estimate of the case fatality rate of about 10%. However, this under ascertainment

142

should not alter the estimates obtained from the epidemic curve provided the case

143

ascertainment remained relatively constant throughout the study period. The decreasing

144

trend in the proportion of RT-PCR positive tests lend support to this assumption.

145

The mortality curve is consistent with a 2-week delay relative to the epidemic curve of

146

the COVID-19 cases, as well as with hospital data reported elsewhere,9 confirming our

147

findings about the effectiveness of the mitigation efforts. COVID-19 mortality may also

148

be under ascertained in Puerto Rico.

149

These results show benefits associated with the early implementation of NPIs for

150

COVID-19, with stay-at home orders, accompanied by mandated curfew and closure of

151

non-essential services in a manner consistent with historical reports of benefits

152

observed with similar use of NPIS in various U.S. cities during the 1918-1919 influenza

153

pandemic7 For sustained benefit, robust ongoing surveillance system will help identify

154

incidence changes to inform policy decisions. In addition, these data serve as a

155

baseline to assess the impact of the transition from mitigation to containment stages in

156

Puerto Rico. We recommend that RT-PCT testing capacity remain available for all

157

symptomatic individuals in Puerto Rico, as well as for all essential workers, and that the

158

public health infrastructure for case investigation and contact tracing, accompanied by

159

targeted isolation and quarantine, continue to be strengthened and scaled up to

160

safeguard the gains observed to date.
