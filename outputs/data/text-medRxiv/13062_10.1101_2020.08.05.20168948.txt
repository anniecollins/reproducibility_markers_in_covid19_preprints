ABSTRACT
The COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2) has overwhelmed health systems worldwide and highlighted limitations of diagnostic
testing. Several types of diagnostics including RT-PCR-based assays, antigen detection by lateral
flow assays and antibody-based assays have been developed and deployed in a short time.
However, many of these assays are lacking in sensitivity and/or specificity. Here, we describe an
immunoaffinity purification followed by high resolution mass spectrometry-based targeted assay
capable of detecting viral antigen in nasopharyngeal swab samples of SARS-CoV-2 infected
individuals. Based on our discovery experiments using purified virus, recombinant viral protein
and nasopharyngeal swab samples from COVID-19 positive patients, nucleocapsid protein was
selected as a target antigen. We then developed an automated antibody capture-based workflow
coupled to targeted high-field asymmetric ion mobility spectrometry (FAIMS) - parallel reaction
monitoring (PRM) assays on an Orbitrap Exploris 480 mass spectrometer. An ensemble machine
learning-based model for determining COVID-19 positive samples was created using fragment
ion intensities in the PRM data. This resulted in 97.8% sensitivity and 100% specificity with RTPCR-based molecular testing as the gold standard. Our results demonstrate that direct detection
of infectious agents from clinical samples by mass spectrometry-based assays have potential to
be deployed as diagnostic assays in clinical laboratories.

INTRODUCTION
Coronaviruses are RNA viruses and include common human coronaviruses, severe acute
respiratory syndrome-CoV (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV (MERS-CoV)
and SARS-CoV-2 (1). Although the large majority of common cold infections caused by
coronaviruses do not have any significant clinical sequelae, the more recently identified
coronaviruses have caused major public health outbreaks (2, 3). SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of the
current COVID-19 pandemic (4, 5). Patients with COVID-19 present with upper respiratory
infections that can result in a number of complications particularly in patients of advanced age or
with co-morbidities. Recent reports show that in many severely ill patients it progresses to a
multi-system disorder involving blood vessels (abnormal blood clotting), heart (acute cardiac
injury, myocarditis and cardiac arrhythmias), kidneys (acute renal injury), liver, gut and brain (615).
Accurate and timely laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19 is one of the most pivotal requirements
for optimal disease management and contact tracing. Historically, cell culture was the mainstay
of viral antigen detection, and it still remains necessary to a minor degree, because it is the only
technique capable of providing a viable isolate that can be used for further characterization of the
virus. Cell culture for virus isolation also remains a useful method for growing and studying
viruses in research settings especially in the characterization of novel pathogenic viruses like
SARS-CoV-2 although this requires more advanced containment facilities such as biosafety level
3 (BSL-3).
The vast majority of current laboratory testing for COVID-19 is based either on detection of viral
antigens, nucleic acids or on detection of virus-specific antibodies in the sera of patients. Viral
antigen detection is generally based on immunoassays while viral nucleic acid detection is
performed by real time quantitative RT-PCR, droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) or, less commonly,
by techniques such as isothermal amplification (16). Immunoassays offer moderate to good
detection sensitivity and relative rapid analytical turnaround times, but some viruses such as
enteroviruses and rhinoviruses have extensive antigenic heterogeneity, which makes them less
amenable to antigen detection methods. Of the molecular methods, RT-PCR and dd-PCR
typically have superior detection sensitivity compared to immunoassays and less problems with
viruses that show antigenic shifts, while similar turnaround times to immunoassays. Detection of
virus-specific antibodies allows for diagnosis of recent symptomatic or even asymptomatic
infections. IgM antibodies are the first antibody isotype that develop rapidly within days after
infection, while IgG levels take a week or longer to rise. Overall, the biggest advantage of
nucleic acid-based assays is that a new assay for a previously unknown virus can generally be
developed and validated in a matter of a days or a few weeks after the virus is first cultured,
whereas development time lines for immunoassays are substantially longer (17, 18). However,
the increased demand for PCR testing worldwide has resulted in test shortages and the acute
need for more available accurate diagnostic tests.
Detection of viral material using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LCMS/MS) might also have sufficient sensitivity for viral antigen detection. Previous studies have
suggested that detection of viral proteins in body fluids could be a rapid diagnostic method for
severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (19-21). Moreover, in the nearly two decades since

the initial SARS outbreak, tremendous improvements have occurred in liquid chromatography as
well as mass spectrometry and their applications in both research and clinical laboratories. The
current generation of LC-MS-based approaches can be used for direct identification of viral
proteins at relatively low concentrations and might therefore be suitable for clinical diagnostic
applications. Nucleocapsid protein from SARS patients was abundant enough to be detected in
clinical samples using an ELISA approach (20). Despite this, there are few, if any, studies which
have focused on the detection of the viral proteins in biological samples by mass spectrometry.
Targeted proteomic approaches utilizing multiple reaction monitoring or parallel reaction
monitoring (MRM/PRM) are highly sensitive, allow robust detection and possess the analytical
speed for clinical testing. In a pandemic situation, these approaches could supplement and
complement nucleic acid based viral antigen testing. Here, we describe the development and
evaluation of a mass spectrometry-based targeted assay for sensitive and accurate detection of
viral antigenic peptides from nasopharyngeal swab samples of COVID-19 patients with high
sensitivity and specificity.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
We first sought to analyze the SARS-CoV-2 viral proteome by analyzing inactivated SARSCoV-2 virus and recombinant viral proteins to determine which proteins and peptides are
detectable. The next step was to select the most promising peptides based on spectral abundance
and response intensity and to create targeted PRM methods to characterize their performance.
Finally, we developed targeted assays deploying automated antibody capture-based workflow,
followed by a rapid separation low-flow LC method and a PRM MS method incorporating ion
mobility for selected viral peptides. In all, we tested 363 nasopharyngeal residual swab samples
from patients with matched clinical molecular test results
SARS-CoV-2 proteome
An overview of the genome organization of SARS-CoV-2 is presented in Figure 1A. This virus
is most closely related to SARS-CoV and to MERS. The common human coronaviruses (OC43,
HKU1, NL63 and L229E) are less related to SARS-CoV-2 than to each other. A sequence
alignment of nucleocapsid protein in these coronaviruses is presented in Figure S1. A schematic
of domain and functional organization of two of the major structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2,
along with the location of the peptides identified in our studies is shown in Figure 1B.
Nucleocapsid protein as a target viral antigen for assay development
To characterize the SARS-CoV-2 proteome, we analyzed purified gamma-irradiated SARSCoV-2 virus samples (USA-WA1/2020 isolate) cultured in African green monkey (Chlorocebus
aethiops) kidney cells (Vero E6). The inactivated virus samples were digested with trypsin and
analyzed on a high resolution Orbitrap Eclipse mass spectrometer interfaced with an RSLCnano
system using a 3 hr gradient. Searches against a database that included proteins from African
green monkey, humans and SARS-CoV-2 plus other coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, MERS and
common human coronaviruses) identified 950 proteins from monkey, 100 proteins from human
(likely because of lack of a complete protein database for monkey) and 5 proteins (50 peptides)

from SARS-CoV-2 including nucleocapsid (23 peptides), spike glycoprotein (22 peptides),
membrane protein (2 peptides), orf1a (1 peptide) and orf9b (2 peptides) (Table S1).
SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid is highly expressed during infection (22) and a potential target for
viral detection by mass spectrometry. The nucleocapsid protein forms a supercoiled helix
structure and helps package the single stranded viral RNA genome with at least 1,000
nucleocapsid molecules per virion (23, 24). Since, cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 often contain
several virions, it is therefore possible to detect even relatively low viral loads in patient samples
with modern LC-MS/MS instrumentation. Indeed, we consistently detected nucleocapsid-derived
peptides as the most abundant peptides in our studies of the inactivated virus Trypsin digestion
and analysis by untargeted LC-MS/MS of recombinant nucleocapsid protein was undertaken to
identify candidate peptides for targeted detection by LC-MS/MS assays. This analysis identified
32 peptides, most of which were unique to SARS-CoV-2 (13 were indistinguishable from SARSCoV) (Figure S1). Peptides identified from SARS-CoV-2 recombinant nucleocapsid protein are
summarized in Figure 1C and Table S1. To test if the peptides identified from these
overexpression systems would also be identified from clinical samples, we performed LCMS/MS-based deep proteomic profiling of pooled nasopharyngeal samples that had been
confirmed by molecular test as SARS-CoV-2 positive. Database searches against human and
SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS and other common human coronavirus proteins resulted in
identification of 5,269 human proteins (50,540 peptides) and 5 proteins (55 peptides) from
SARS-CoV-2 which included nucleocapsid protein (36 peptides), spike glycoprotein (3
peptides), membrane protein (1 peptide), orf9b (3 peptides) and orf8 (2 peptides), which was
highly similar to the profiles previously obtained. Of the peptides that could uniquely identify
SARS-CoV-2, four were chosen for targeted assay development for optimal detection (25)
(Figure 2A-D) - all of them were unique to SARS-CoV-2 as shown by the sequence alignment
with SARS-CoV, MERS and other common human coronaviruses (Figure 2E).
Optimization of pre-analytical variables
Based on our discovery experiments, we decided upon nucleocapsid protein as our target antigen
for assay development. We optimized several pre-analytical parameters including protein
extraction, various antibodies for capture of nucleocapsid protein and the use of ion mobility.
A. Protein extraction optimization
To maximize protein yield from nasopharyngeal swab samples, we tested several protein
extraction methods including methanol precipitation, 2% SDS, 0.002% Z316 zwitterionic
detergent and RIPA buffer. The processed samples were immunopurified and MS/MS fragment
intensities for AYNVTQAFGR and QQTVTLLPAADLDDFSK peptides were compared. From
these experiments, 0.002% Z316 was selected for protein extraction and subsequent capture
using antibody.
B. Direct digest and immunopurification
Next, we tested if we could detect the nucleocapsid protein directly after proteolytic digest or if
enrichment using an anti-nucleocapsid antibody prior to digestion was required for detection. For

this comparison, a monoclonal antibody (Sino Biological, Wayne PA, Cat# 40143-R001) was
biotinylated and immobilized to streptavidin mass spectrometry immunoassay (MSIA) tips for
capture using an automated liquid handler. In all, 89 patient samples were analyzed with each
method (69 positive and 20 negative as tested by RT-PCR). To determine if antibody enrichment
resulted in an increase in sensitivity, a cutoff was established at 3 standard deviations above the
average peak height observed for AYNVTQAFGR and QQTVTLLPAADLDDFSK in the 20
RT-PCR negative samples. Peptide signals above the cutoff threshold in RT-PCR positive
samples were then counted. Antibody enrichment resulted in 14 and 24 additional positive
samples which were above the cutoff for AYNVTQAFGR and QQTVTLLPAADLDDFSK,
respectively. The additional samples above the cutoff in antibody enriched samples had higher Ct
values (i.e. lower viral loads) as compared to samples above the cutoff for both the methods,
indicating that immunoaffinity enrichment results in a greater sensitivity relative to direct digest
(Table S2).
C. Antibody enrichment optimization
To improve the efficiency of nucleocapsid capture, 17 different antibodies against the
nucleocapsid protein were evaluated (Table S3). Four antibodies which displayed the best
performance characteristics were compared side by side using pooled patient samples with high,
medium or low viral loads (based on Ct values from real time quantitative RT-PCR-based
molecular testing). This comparison identified two monoclonal antibodies with suitable
performance from which we selected one for further development of the assay.
D. Improved sensitivity with ion mobility
In discovery LC-MS/MS analysis of eluates after nucleocapsid enrichment from nasopharyngeal
samples, we detected >2,000 peptides. This poses unique challenges especially if short
chromatographic separation is desired for targeted detection owing to interference from the
highly complex matrix. Orthogonal gas phase separation such as ion mobility for separation of
charged ions based on their size could potentially provide additional separation that might be
beneficial. A front-end high-field asymmetric waveform ion mobility spectrometry (FAIMS)
source typically filters ions entering into the ion transfer capillary by reducing background
chemical noise resulting in increased sensitivity and robustness (26, 27)To determine if FAIMS
could increase specificity for the viral peptides, we optimized compensation voltages for the
peptides of interest from nucleocapsid protein. Those that resulted in the highest signal
intensities were chosen to build the targeted method (Table S4). We analyzed nasopharyngeal
swab samples with and without FAIMS and observed significantly improved signal-to-noise
(S/N) ratio with FAIMS. Figure S2A shows the PRM signal of AYNVTQAFGR peptide from a
representative nasopharyngeal swab sample (relatively high viral load; Ct value of 20) where the
S/N with FAIMS was 965 as compared to 67 without FAIMS. Figure S2B shows the PRM
signal for AYNVTQAFGR peptide in another representative nasopharyngeal swab sample with a
low viral load (Ct value of 30) that could not be detected without FAIMS. Based on these data,
we incorporated FAIMS into our assay workflow.

After optimization of protein extraction, capture and LC-MS/MS acquisition parameters, we
selected two peptides for the final targeted assay. To maintain optimal performance, the sample
preparation and chromatography conditions were further refined. The sample preparation
workflow was automated using Versette liquid handler which minimized overall time and
experimental variation during sample processing. The throughput and robustness of the sample
analysis was achieved by coupling Evosep One with Exploris 480 mass spectrometer, allowing
analysis of 100 samples per day without sacrificing sensitivity.
Synthetic isotopically labeled heavy peptides were used for optimization of LC-MS/MS
parameters including collision energy, retention time and relative intensity of fragment ions.
Table 1 shows details of peptides including sequence, precursor m/z, charge, retention time and
FAIMS compensation voltages. This optimized assay was used to analyze 363 residual
nasopharyngeal swab samples previously tested by quantitative real time RT-PCR. Figure 3
shows a schematic of optimized workflow for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 using FAIMS-PRM
targeted mass spectrometry.
We analyzed 187 nasopharyngeal swab samples (116 positive and 71 negative) using the
optimized FAIMS-PRM workflow and used supervised machine learning to select the optimal
fragments and determine their weights for maximizing the performance of the targeted mass
spectrometry assay. Using this as a training dataset, we employed an ensemble-based machine
learning approach encoded in Super Learner as described previously (28). This method was
configured to use a generalized linear model via penalized maximum likelihood (glmNET),
generalized linear model (GLM) and random forest (RF) model; all configured to use binomial
distribution. A 10-fold cross-validation with a goal to maximize the AUC and to prevent
overfitting was instituted during the learning process. An optimal weighted average of the trained
models (i.e glmNET, GLM and RF) was computed and considered as a final composite model to
evaluate performance on an independent validation dataset. This ensemble method incorporated
a total of 17 fragments, resulting in an AUC of 0.9956 on the training set. Based on the
probability distribution of negative and positive samples in the training set, we chose a
probability of ≥0.6 as threshold for calling a positive sample (Figure 4A and 4B). We applied
this composite model to an independent validation dataset of 176 samples (88 positive and 88
negative samples) using the exact same optimized FAIMS-PRM workflow. This resulted in
achieving a sensitivity of 97.8% and specificity of 100% with an AUC=1.0. These results show
that our assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antigen performed with a very high sensitivity and specificity, especially compared to other reported rapid antigen lateral flow assays (29).
Assay performance as compared to RT-PCR tests
Although RT-PCR remains the well-established gold standard for viral pathogen detection, the
FAIMS-PRM workflow displays very high sensitivity and specificity. To ensure that samples
used for training and validation of the model reflect the distribution observed in a large
population, we mimicked the distribution of Ct values for 11,575 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients
tested at Mayo Clinic (Figure 4C) in the training and test set samples (Figure 4D). Ct values
obtained from the large population approximate a normal distribution (mean = 26.5, IQR = 21.1 31.3) and agree well with the training and validation samples (mean = 26.5, IQR = 21.8 - 31.4).
While naïve, uncalibrated Ct values are not themselves quantitative they can serve as an estimate

of relative target abundance. Peptide peaks heights derived from mass spectrometry analysis also
provide semi quantitative information. To determine the feasibility of using peak heights as an
estimate of viral abundance Ct values were correlated to peak heights using the training and
validation data sets (Figure 4E and 4F). Indeed, both peptides display good correlation with Ct
values (QQTVTLLPAADLDDFSK r2 = 0.73, AYNVTQAFGR r2 = 0.73) indicating that viral
peptide peak height may additionally serve as an estimate of viral abundance.
Conclusions
In this study, we report development of a mass spectrometry-based targeted assay that permits
direct detection of viral antigens from clinical specimens. A key advantage of this targeted
method is the high specificity and comparable sensitivity to the gold standard RT-PCR method
for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. Definitive identification by this method can also serve as a
reference method for other antigen testing assays such lateral flow assays, many of which lack
sensitivity. In addition, the method can be applied to other sample types (e.g. urine, saliva) and
can be adapted for detection of novel variants of SARS-CoV-2 as they appear. Finally, our
method with rapid chromatographic separation followed by highly sensitive mass spectrometry
detection provides a throughput of 100 samples per day and can be easily deployed at routine
clinical laboratories with mass spectrometry instrumentation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
COVID-19 specimen collection and handling
All samples were collected after informed consent and approval by the institutional review
board. All clinical samples were de-identified prior to analysis.
Chemicals and reagents
The following reagents were deposited by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and
obtained through BEI Resources, NIAID, NIH: SARS-Related Coronavirus 2, Isolate USAWA1/2020, gamma-irradiated, NR-52287. Tris (2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride
(TCEP) and iodoacetamide were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA). Phosphate
buffered saline (PBS) was purchased from Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA, USA). Trifluoroacetic acid
(TFA) was purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA, USA). Zwittergent Z3-16
was purchased from CalBiochem (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). Dynabeads M-280
Streptavidin was purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA). Trypsin/Lys-C Mix and
Rapid Digestion kit was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI, USA). Recombinant SARSCoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (97-077) was purchased from ProSci (Fort Collins, CO).
Synthesis of isotopically labeled heavy peptide standards
All SARS-CoV-2-derived peptides were synthesized using standard FMOC chemistry on a
Liberty Blue (CEM Corp. Matthews, NC) peptide synthesizer with methods suggested by the
manufacturer. Starting resin was either arginine (pbf) 13C6, 15N4 2Cl-trt resin or lysine (boc) 13C6
15
N2 2Cl-trt resin (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Tewksbury, MA), depending on the
sequence. A second stable isotope labeled amino acid was incorporated into the sequence using
Fmoc-Leucine-OH 13C6 15N, Fmoc-Glycine-OH 13C2 15N, or Fmoc-Alanine-OH 13C3 (IsoTec,
Inc., Miamisburg, OH) as dictated by the sequence. Peptides were cleaved using the CEM Razor
cleavage module heated to 42˚C for 40 min. Cleavage cocktail was trifluoroacetic acid, water,
triisopropyl silane and 3,6-Dioxa-1,8-octanedithiol (92.5/2.5/2.5/2.5 v/v/v/v). Peptides were
precipitated in cold methyl-t-butyl ether, washed and dried for purification. Purification was
achieved by reversed-phase HPLC using a Phenomenex Jupiter C18 column, 250 x 21.2 mm,
using a water/acetonitrile buffer system. Peptide purity and integrity were confirmed using an
Agilent InfinityLab II LC/ MSD (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) system.
Processing of nasopharyngeal swab samples and in-solution trypsin digestion
Nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected in PBS and digested directly in-solution. 100 µl of
sample was diluted three-fold with rapid digest buffer (Promega, Madison WI) and 1.5 µg of
trypsin was added. The samples were placed on a thermomixer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham,
MA) at 70°C for 1 hr with rotation at 1,150 rpm for trypsin digestion. To terminate the digestion,
the samples were acidified to 0.2% TFA. The samples were desalted using C18 solid phase
extraction spin columns (Glygen, Columbia, MD), dried down and reconstituted in 20 µl of 0.2%
formic acid. Recombinant proteins and inactivated purified SARS-CoV-2 were digested using
the method described above for the swab samples with the following modifications: protein

content of the purified SARS-CoV-2 was estimated using a BCA assay (Pierce Waltham, MA)
and trypsin was added to all samples at a 1:10 enzyme to substrate ratio. Following digestion,
disulfide bonds were reduced and cysteines were alkylated simultaneously with the addition of 5
mM TCEP and 5 mM IAA. Samples were incubated in dark for 30 min at room temperature
prior to sample acidification and cleanup.
Untargeted LC-MS/MS experiments
LC-MS/MS analysis for untargeted discovery proteomics experiments was carried out using an
Ultimate 3000 RSLCnano system (Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA) connected to an Orbitrap
Eclipse mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA). The peptides were loaded onto a
trap column (PepMap C18 2 cm × 100 µm, 100 Å) at a flow rate of 20 µl/min using 0.1% formic
acid and separated on an analytical column (EasySpray 50 cm × 75 µm, C18 1.9 µm, 100 Å,
Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA) with a flow rate of 300 nl/min with a linear gradient of 5 to
40% solvent B (100% ACN, 0.1% formic acid) over a 40 min gradient. Both precursor and
fragment ions were acquired in the Orbitrap mass analyzer. Precursor ions were acquired in m/z
range of 350–1700 with a resolution of 120,000 (at m/z 200). Precursor fragmentation was
carried out using higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) method using normalized
collision energy (NCE) of 28. The fragment ions were acquired at a resolution of 30,000 (at m/z
200). The scans were arranged in top-speed method with 3 seconds cycle time between MS and
MS/MS. Ion transfer capillary voltage was maintained at 2.5 kV. For internal mass calibration,
lock mass option was enabled with polysiloxane ion (m/z, 445.120025) from ambient air.
Anti-nucleocapsid antibody-based enrichment of nucleocapsid protein and in-solution
trypsin digestion
In order to improve the sensitivity of the detection, we evaluated a number of antibodies as
shown in Table S3. Briefly, antibody was biotinylated using biotinylation kit (ThermoFisher
Scientific, San Jose, CA) as per manufacturer’s instructions. Biotinylated antibody (1 µg) was
coated on streptavidin MSIA tips (Catalog#991STR11, ThermoFisher Scientific, San Jose, CA)
in 0.1% BSA containing 1X PBS on the Versette automated liquid handler (ThermoFisher
Scientific, San Jose, CA). Nasopharyngeal swab samples (750 µl) were mixed with zwitterion
Z316 at final concentration of 0.002% in 96 well plate and were inactivated at 70°C for 30
minutes. Inactivated samples were subjected to enrichment using mass spectrometry
immunoassay (MSIA)-based enrichment using biotinylated antibody, washed two times with 200
µl 1X PBS and eluted in 100 µl of 50% ACN/0.002% Z316 in 0.1% TFA. Sample eluent was
mixed with 300 μl of rapid trypsin digestion buffer (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI) and
subjected to in-solution trypsin digestion (Gold Trypsin, Promega Corporation, Madison, WI) at
70°C for 1 hour on a shaker incubator. The digest was acidified using TFA to a final
concentration of 1% TFA. The acidified digests were spiked-in with synthetic isotope labelled
heavy peptides and the samples were loaded on EvoTips as per manufacturer’s instructions.
Briefly, the C18 EvoTips were activated using 20 µl of 100% acetonitrile followed by
equilibration with 20 µl of 0.1% formic acid in water. Activation and equilibration was carried
out at 700 x g for 1 minute. The sample was loaded at 500 x g for 5 minute followed by washing
using 0.1% formic acid once. At last the tips were loaded with 100 µl of 0.1% formic acid and
processed for targeted analysis.

Targeted Parallel Reaction Monitoring (PRM) analysis
Parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) analysis was performed on an Exploris 480 mass
spectrometer equipped with FAIMS Pro ion source (Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany) and
interfaced with a preformed gradient LC system (EvoSep One, EvoSep Inc., Odense, Denmark).
FAIMS Compensation voltages were optimized for peptides from nucleocapsid protein;
AYNVTQAFGR and QQTVTLLPAADLDDFSK. Individual positive and negative swab
samples were processed for antibody capture and trypsin digestion as described above. Peptides
were eluted at a flow rate of 2 µl / minute into a pre-formed gradient using the Evosep One LC
system connected to the Exploris 480 mass spectrometer equipped with FAIMS Pro ion source.
Peptide separation was carried out using a 4 cm analytical column (Dr. Maisch C18AQ, 1.9 µm,
150 µm x 4 cm) with a 5.6 min gradient. Data acquisition parameters included MS1 scan from
560-100 m/z at resolution of 60,000 followed by retention time scheduled PRM analysis of
AYNVTQAFGR and QQTVTLLPAADLDDFSK peptides and corresponding double SIL heavy
peptides. The PRM parameters included: Orbitrap resolution of 60,000, AGC target value of 5 x
104, injection time of 118 ms, isolation window of m/z 1 and HCD normalized collision energy
of 27. Table 1 shows targeted inclusion list with retention time scheduled PRM scans for light
and heavy versions of AYNVTQAFGR and QQTVTLLPAADLDDFSK with corresponding
FAIMS compensation voltages (CV).
Mass spectrometry data analysis of untargeted LC-MS/MS data
The raw mass spectrometry data were searched using Andromeda in MaxQuant software suite
(version 1.6.7.0) (30) against a combined protein database of SARS-CoV-2 proteins, SARS-CoV
proteins, common coronaviruses (OC43, HKU1, NL63 and L229E) and UniProt human protein
database, African green monkey (Chlorocebus aethiops) database (in case of irradiated virus MS
data) including common MS contaminants. The search parameters included a maximum of two
missed cleavages; carbamidomethylation at cysteine as a fixed modification for samples that
were reduced and alkylated; N-terminal acetylation and oxidation at methionine as variable
modifications. Precursor tolerance was set to 10 ppm and MS/MS tolerance to ±0.02 Da. False
discovery rate was set to 1% at the peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs), peptide and protein levels.
Data analysis of targeted LC-MS/MS data
The PRM data were processed using the Skyline software package (31). PRM data were assessed
for (i) peak symmetry and baseline; (ii) consistency of retention times and (iii) retention time
consistency across transitions of the same analyte. In addition, peak integration of extracted ion
chromatogram of all plausible fragments of light and heavy precursor was adjusted manually to
avoid potential interferences. The fragment ion intensities were exported from skyline and
(natural) log transformed. A supervised machine learning method was used to select the optimal
fragments and determine their weights for maximizing the performance of the targeted mass
spectrometry assay. All computations were performed in R (version 4.0.1). For this, we utilized
an ensemble-based machine learning approach encoded in the Super Learner as described
previously. This method was configured to use a generalized linear model via penalized
maximum likelihood (glmNET), generalized linear model (glm) and random forest model; all

AUC was instituted during the learning process. An optimal weighted average of the different
trained models was computed and considered as final model for an independent validation.
