Inclusive Costs of NPI Measures for COVID-19 Pandemic:
Three Approaches
Alexander Ugarov
March 26, 2020

Abstract
The paper evaluates total inclusive costs of three public health approaches to
address the COVID-19 epidemic in the US based on epidemiological projections in
Ferguson et al (2020). We calculate and add costs of lost productivity and costs of
mortality measured through the value of statistical life. We find that the aggressive approach which involves strict suppression measures and a drastic reduction
of economic activity for three months with extensive testing and case tracking afterwards results in the lowest total costs for the society. The approach of doing no
non-pharmaceutical measures results in the lowest total costs if the infection fatality
rate falls below 0.15%.

Introduction

As more and more countries are imposing strict measures to suppress the COVID-19
pandemic, there is a growing concern that these measures increase total societal costs.
Existing literature suggests that mitigation policies do not necessarily provide net benefits to the society (Mesnard and Seabright, 2009). While mitigation decreases deaths,
it also reduces economic activity. For example, preliminary data from China suggests
approximately 10% decline in GDP in the first quarter of 20201 .
This paper conducts the first (to out knowledge) cost-benefit analysis of potential
mitigation measures for the COVID-19 epidemic in the US. We calculate total societal
costs of the pandemic and corresponding non-pharmaceutical measures. These costs include three components: costs of mortality, costs of illness and costs of reduced economic
activity due to mitigation and precautionary demand.
We put a monetary value on COVID-19 deaths by using the value of statistical life
approach. While it seems weird to put a monetary estimate on life, people often do
it implicitly while deciding to save time by speeding or deciding to save money by not
investing in tornado shelters. The value of statistical life represents the amount of money
people willingly accept for increasing their own risk of death. This approach becomes
more common in public health literature (Jamison et al, 2013) and is already standard
for many environmental protection agencies both in the US and abroad.
This cost-benefit analysis calculates monetary estimates of total costs for three different approaches. The laissez-faire implies doing nothing. The herd immunity
approach applies non-pharmaceutical measures to keep the number of new cases at the
maximum of healthcare capacity. The third aggressive approach uses the most aggressive non-pharmaceutical suppression and mitigation measures to reduce the number
of new cases and then tries to eliminate the virus through extensive testing, case tracking
and case isolation. We use the results of epidemiological modeling (Ferguson et al, 2020)
for the first two approaches and our conservative estimates based on existing data for
the third approach to project the number of infections, number of critical cases and the
number of deaths. We then calculate costs of mitigation measures and of the disease
itself for total output and add these costs to the costs of lives lost estimated through
the value of statistical life approach.
We find that the aggressive approach achieves the lowest total costs for the society

for any reasonable value of statistical life (VSL) and for baseline epidemiological assumptions. The herd immunity approach dominates the laissez-faire approach of doing
nothing for most of the VSL range except for the lowest end. The laissez-faire approach
starts to completely dominate the herd immunity approach if the infection fatality rate
(IFR) falls below 0.3% and it starts dominating the aggressive approach completely for
IFR below 0.15%.
The calculus of total costs would shift more in favor of the herd immunity approach
by accounting for increasing capacity of the healthcare system, gradual elimination of
suppression measures and for the positive effect of suppression measures on infections
from other airborne diseases. On another hand, the herd immunity approach might be
completely unfeasible if the immunity from the virus lasts less than 2 years, while the
laissez-faire and aggressive approaches might results in a complete eradication of the
virus in human population.

Method and Assumptions

2.1

Potential Policies

We consider three potential policy approaches. Two of these approaches are consistent
with approaches suggested in Ferguson et al (2020). The aggressive approach is not a
part of Ferguson et al (2020), but roughly follows the steps taken by China and several
other Asian countries (South Korea, Taiwan, Japan, Singapore). All of these policies
are assumed to start in the US at the beginning of April.
Laissez-faire Approach. Federal, state and local authorities take no mitigation
or suppression measures in this scenario. Population can still take precautions if their
personal benefits exceed personal costs. This scenario is closest to the approach used in
the 2009 flu pandemic and other flu epidemics with lower mortality rates.
Herd Immunity Approach. In the herd immunity approach, the state imposes
multiple NPI in order to bring R0 down to the level slightly above one. Then, after the
number of infections gets to close to the healthcare capacity and while the proportion of
immune individuals in the population grows, it slowly dismantle NPI measures in order
to keep the number of new infections at the level of healthcare capacity.
The analysis by Ferguson et al (2020) suggests that the combination of three measures
implements this approach: school closures, home quarantines and social distancing of
the entire population. Any smaller combination of measures is insufficient for reducing

the reproductive number to one and would put an over-stress on the healthcare system.
School closures imply that all public schools close and children have to stay at home
with their parents. Home quarantines mean that the whole household avoids going
outside (including to work) for some period if any household member tests positive
for COVID-19. We interpret social distancing to mean closure or complete avoidance
of food services and drinking places, entertainment, arts and recreation as consuming
these services conflicts with social distancing.
Aggressive Approach. In this approach, the government imposes extremely strict
measures in order to suppress the epidemic and to bring the number of new cases close
to zero. These measures last three months from April to June. The number of new cases
is then held at the level around zero without strict movement and distancing restrictions
through mass testing, case tracking and isolation.
The experience of China in January-February 2020 demonstrates the the aggressive
approach can effectively reduce the number of cases to almost zero. These measure
included extensive testing, mask wearing, shutting down most non-essential businesses
and strict movement restrictions (shelter-in-place, lock-down policies). The experience of
South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan demonstrates that for low number of infections, case
tracking and isolation can keep the epidemic at bay without strict movement restrictions.

2.2

Epidemiological Assumptions

The disease has 0.9% infection fatality rate meaning that almost one percent of individuals catching it eventually die from the disease. Only 67% of cases are symptomatic, the
duration of sickness in mild symptomatic cases is 5 days and during this period individuals do not work. Approximately 1.3% of cases are severe enough to require critical care
for 10 days on average. One-half of patients in critical care eventually dies and 0.023%
of patients not requiring critical care also dies. All patients in a need of critical care die
without it.
The calculation of new infections for laissez-faire and herd immunity approach corresponds to the predictions made for the US in Ferguson et al (2020), Figure A1. In the
laissez-faire approach, the disease would end up infecting about 80% of the US population. The peak of the epidemic would happen in June with approximately 50% infected
in some moment during that month. In the herd immunity approach mitigation and
suppression measure would hold the number of case at the existing level of critical care
capacity, which is around 138 th cases per month assuming that each critical care patient
spends 10 days in an ICU. The epidemic and (most) mitigation measures would need to

last until May 2022 to achieve the necessary herd immunity of 80% of population.
The calculation for the aggressive approach assumes that new cases stabilize in April
and begin to decrease afterwards at the rate of 80% per month. After reaching 800 cases
per month, the infection rate stabilizes due to missed and imported cases. We believe
that this is a conservative estimate with respect to efficiency of aggressive mitigation
measures. For comparison, in China the number of new cases went down from the peak
of 3073 of new cases reported on February 11th to only 31 new case reported on March
11 (99% per month)2 . In Italy, the number of new cases has been decreasing for three
consecutive days since March 20th at the rate of at least 12% per day which corresponds
to 98% decrease in one month.

2.3

Economic Costs

Economic costs come from three sources: direct costs of illness and treatment, employment losses and losses due to falling demand or mandatory shutdowns. This approach is
consistent with the standard approaches used to estimate economic costs of the epidemic
(Jonung and Roeger, 2006; Keogh-Brown et al, 2010).
We calculate direct costs of illness as costs of critical care stay for patients receiving
critical care. The average cost per in-patient stay in the US is around 2000 USD, but
varies across states and hospital types3 . We assume that each day in an ICU increases
hospital’s costs by 2000 USD and hence the average stay costs $20000 per each critical
care patient with COVID-19.
Falling demand and mandatory shutdowns affect transport, food services, accommodation, arts and recreation. In the herd immunity approach, food services, arts and
recreation shut down completely. Air transport loses 70% of output (note that about
15% of revenue in the US comes from mail and cargo) while ground transport and accommodation lose 50% of output for the duration of NPI measures (until May 2022). There
are no mandatory shutdowns in the laissez-faire approach, but for peak infection month
people avoid shopping in public places. For simplicity, we assume that the decrease in
demand during the peak month of the epidemic (June 2020) is equal to the decrease in
demand experienced due to social distancing measures in the herd immunity approach.
In contrast to some older studies (Smith et al, 2009) we do not assume that the epidemic
causes a decrease in the demand for goods given a widespread use of online shopping in

the US.
The decrease in value added in affected sectors adds up to 4.4% of GDP. In our
calculation, this is the total negative effect on GDP due to demand shocks and shutdowns. This estimate ignores the potential substitution from affected sectors to other
goods and services. Accounting for substitution would make the negative effect smaller.
On another hand, it also ignores spillovers effects to other sectors supplying goods and
services, which could increase the actual effect. This negative effect on GDP lasts from
April 2020 to May 2022 in the herd immunity approach, but happens only in June 2020
in the laissez-faire approach. These demand shocks also make redundant almost 8% of
the US workforce.
Next, we consider the labor supply effects on output. The large part of output
effects comes from employment losses due to sickness, home quarantines and school
closures. Sickness losses equal to the number of symptomatic mild cases multiplied
by 5 days (duration of symptoms) plus the number of critical cases multiplied by one
month (average duration of critical cases). Total employment losses due to sickness are
approximately equal for the laissez-faire approach and for the herd immunity approach
as in both approaches the virus ends up infecting around 80% of population.
Home quarantines imposed in the herd immunity approach involve 14-day shelterin-place orders for all the household members if one household members gets diagnosed
with COVID-19. Consistent with Ferguson et al (2020), we assume that only 50% of
household comply with quarantine orders. The average number of workers per household
weighted by household size represents the expected number of workers affected by the
household quarantine per each diagnosed case. Based on the American Community
Survey 2018 obtained from I-PUMS4 , this number is 1.15. Excluding workers which
already quarantine due to sickness, the additional loss of labor supply is 14 ∗ (1.15 ∗ (1 −
s) + (1.15 − 1) ∗ s) days, where s is the proportion of workers in the population (41% in
the US).
School closures decrease labor demand by requiring that at least one adult needs
to be present at home during school hours if the household includes any schoolchildren
younger than 12 years old. To find all the affected households, we consider households
in which the number of 18-80 individuals is equal to the number of full-time workers
commuting to work and which have at least one child with age between 6 and 12 years.
In the ACS 2018, these criteria describe approximately 7mln households and correspond

to 5.2% of full-time workers.
Both demand shock, sickness and other restrictive measures affect the labor supply
concurrently which somewhat reduces the total effect. To calculate the total effect of
sickness, home quarantines and school closures net of demand effects we assume that
these factors act independently from each other except sickness and home quarantines.
We use the following formula to calculate the net effects on employment:
ptot = (1 − pd )(1 − (1 − ps − pq )(1 − psc )
Where ptot is the total effect on employment, pd is the proportion of workers made
redundant due to demand shocks and shutdowns, ps is the proportion of workers falling
sick, pq is the proportion of labor supply lost due to HH quarantines and psc is the
proportion of workers lost due to school shutdowns. The total effect on employment
corresponds to the 6.6% decrease in employment during most of the epidemic.
In the laissez-faire approach, we assume that 33% of workers or all workers aged 50
and above do not show up for work during the peak epidemic month of June 2020 5 . This
estimate is consistent with Sadique et al (2007) finding that 34% of workers expect to
miss work in peak flu epidemic if mortality rates are high. The net effect on labor supply
accounts for redundant workforce due to lower demand and sickness and corresponds to
36.2% less employment in June 2020.
We translate labor supply shocks into output by multiplying them by the average
worker’s productivity in the US (GDP/Employment). This approach implicitly assumes
zero elasticity of substitution between capital and labor6 . This assumption is consistent
with Grynza and Rycx (2018) who find in a matched employer-employee dataset of
Danish firms that a one percentage point increase in sickness absenteeism reduces firm’s
output by approximately one percent7 .
As there is little guidance on potential productivity effects of most aggressive policies,
5. Working in June increases chances to catch the disease for non-immune individuals by approximately 20% with additional daily risk of around 0.007%. Given the risk of death conditional on disease
of 0.6% for the group of 50-60 yrs old, the daily mortality risk outweighs the wages lost due to absenteeism (around $170 per day in the US) for most workers assuming the value of statistical life of
$3mln.
6. The alternative approach would be to use the more flexible production function (such as CobbDouglas) to account for substitution which would reduce projected output losses.
7. Note also that if we take the predicted labor supply effects in more sophisticated general equilibrium
models (as Smith et al, 2009 and Keogh-Brown et al, 2010) and take them as predictions of output effects,
the resulting output effects would closely match the predictions of general equilibrium models (within
20%, not percentage points!) as their GE multiplier effects compensate lower elasticities of substitution
between capital and labor.

we choose the most conservative pessimistic approach. We assume that the economy loses
100% of its labor force for the duration of these measures (3 months). This is the most
conservative estimate given that some essential sectors still operate even in the case of
Hubei province in China8 .
Our preliminary estimates of testing and case tracking costs needed in the aggressive
approach are negligible compared to costs of lost productivity and costs of mortality.
Assuming that we test all residents experiencing common cold or flu symptoms which
happens about 3 times per year (Arroll, 2011) and using the Medicare reimbursement
rate of $51 as a measure of direct testing cost, the total testing costs of testing add up
to approximately only $4 bln per month. Case tracking costs would be even smaller as
long as infection rate remain in the predicted range. For example, hiring additional 1000
specialists to track cases with wages of $100,000 per year would cost less than $10 mln
per month.

2.4

Mortality Costs

The population willingness to trade an increased risk of death for money or value of
statistical life is the most crucial parameter of this cost-benefit analysis. There is a large
uncertainty on the appropriate number for the value of statistical life (VSL). Two most
common approaches to estimate VSL use either wage premiums in riskier occupations
(compensating wage differentials approach) or directly ask for people’s willingness to
pay for public programs to reduce mortality risks (stated preference approach). Viscusi
and Aldi (2003) recommend the range of $7-12.4mln per life based on the meta-study
of compensating wage differentials papers. Stated preference literature typically finds
somewhat lower estimates. For example, the OECD recommends using the value of statistical life range of $1.8-5.5 mln based on the meta-study of stated preference literature.
To account for this uncertainty, we calculate the total costs of each program for
two values of statistical life at opposite points of the plausible range. The low value of
statistical life in our analysis is $3mln. The high value of statistical life is $10mln. For
comparison, the US Environmental Protection Agency uses the value of statistical life
of around $8.6mln (based on Alberini et al, 2019). There are indications that people
are willing to pay similar amounts to save themselves from risks of death from SARS
respiratory illnesses (Liu et al, 2005).

The literature finds that the value of statistical life slightly decreases with age for
older people. The effect is much smaller as would be expected just based on expected
years to live. Given the small size of this effect and the potential moral dilemmas, we
avoid accounting for age variation in the VSL.
Mortality costs of the disease are highest for the laissez-faire approach in which the
demand for critical care exceeds healthcare capacity starting from May 2020. It results
in a large number of excess deaths: 3.5 mln vs 2.4 mln in the herd immunity approach.
Accordingly, total mortality costs of the laissez-faire approach add up to $10.6 trillion for
low VSL and $35.47 trillion for high VSL. Total mortality costs of the herd immunity
approach are accordingly 7.1 and 23.8 trillion USD. Total mortality costs are almost
negligible in the aggressive approach ($6.4bln and $21bln).

Results

Before proceeding to the discussion of the total costs, we would like to point out their
crucial determinants. In terms of mortality, the laissez-faire approach results in higher
costs followed by the herd immunity approach and by the aggressive approach. The order
is exactly opposite for the costs on output of goods and services. Hence it is natural to
expect that the the aggressive approach would achieve lower costs if we put high value
lives saved or if the infection fatality rate is low, while the laissez-faire approach would
be the least costly one if the value of statistical life is low or if the mortality is low.
Somewhat surprisingly, we find that the aggressive approach achieves the lowest costs
for the society both for low and high values of statistical life. The total costs ($5500
bln) are more than 50% lower than the costs of the next best approach for low VSL and
more than 80% for high VSL. The costs of shutting down the economy for 3 months are
still lower than the costs of additional mortality experienced both in the herd immunity
and in the laissez-faire approaches.
If the aggressive approach is unfeasible, the laissez-faire and herd immunity approaches result in similar total costs if using the low VSL, but the herd immunity approach achieves significantly lower costs for higher VSL (20% lower if VSL=$10mln).
Given that the existing research tends to point to higher willingness–to-pay to avoid
SARS infections and a higher estimate for VSL used by the Environmental Protection
Agency, economic costs of suppression measures seems to be justified. However, given
the relatively close estimate of total costs for both approaches, it would be interesting to
see how these estimate would change if accounting for additional factors (see extensions)

or by more accurate economic projections.
Note, that both the aggressive approach and the herd immunity approach have lower
costs despite quite pessimistic assumptions applied in these scenarios. For example, the
aggressive approach takes longer than the lockdown in Hubei province of China which
is finishing in two months and does not completely stop the economy. For the herd
immunity approach, we assume no healthcare capacity expansion within 2 years of the
epidemic. And the laissez-faire approach assumes that people’s precautionary responses
are limited to one month only (June).
How low should be the disease mortality rate to justify using the laissez-faire approach? Our calculations show that for the infection fatality rate of 0.15% and lower
doing nothing would minimize total societal costs for the whole range of value of statistical life ($3-10 mln). For comparison, 2009 swine flu had a mortality rate of 0.025%
in the UK (Donaldson et al, 2020) and lower attack rates. Seasonal flu has a slightly
higher mortality, but also lower attack rates.

Limitations and Possible Extensions

Increasing Healthcare Capacity. Increasing critical care capacity would allow to
infect a larger number of individuals each month. This would have no effect on the
total mortality, but would decrease the duration of suppression measures and reduce
their economic impact. Accounting for this factor would decrees total costs of the herd
immunity approach.
Gradual Removal of Suppression Measures in the Herd Immunity Approach. As the proportion of susceptible population goes down, the basic reproduction
number R0 also goes down. It follows from the formula R0 = βsγ where β is the number of contacts made by each person and s is the proportion of susceptible individuals
among these contacts. It means that in the herd immunity approach there would be a
possibility and a need to stop some NPI (school closures?) to keep the number of new

infection at the capacity and to reduce economic costs. Accounting for these changes
would decrease total costs of the herd immunity approach.
Duration of Immunity. The current calculation assumes that the recovering from
the disease grants lasting immunity to it. This is not the case for many other coronaviruses causing common cold (Callow et al, 1993) which give immunity for about one
year. If the immunity is going to last less than two years, the herd immunity approach
would never end the epidemic on its own. Each month the susceptible population would
increase as individuals catching disease several months ago would lose immunity.
Complete Virus Eradication.

Laissez-faire approach would infect more than

70% of population in less than in 4 months. Assuming that recovering from the disease
grants immunity for at least one year, the population would achieve herd immunity and
the epidemic would stop. It means that there is a significant probability that the virus
would completely disappear in the laissez-faire approach as it happened with the virus
responsible for the 1918 flu pandemic. More epidemiological analysis and expertise is
needed to estimate the probability of this event.
Decreasing Flu and Common Cold Attack Rates. Non-pharmaceutical measures considered in this analysis also decrease the transmission of other airborne infectious diseases, including flu, common cold, pertussis and measles. For exampe, during
the 2019-2020 season flu has infected around 36 mln people in the US and caused 370
thousand hospitalizations and 22 thousand deaths. The average annual monetary cost
of seasonal flu epidemics is $87bln in 2003 prices (Molinari et al, 2007) or $163bln if
accounting for higher population, prices and productivity in 2019. Fendrick et al (2003)
estimate the total economic costs of common cold for the US at around $40 bln in 2001
prices (or $81bln accounting for price/population/productivity growth to 2019). These
benefits extend mostly to the herd immunity approach and partially to the agressive
approach.
Leisure. All the approaches increase the amount of leisure to a different degree.
While leisure is valuable to most people, the existing empirical research gives little
guidance on monetary value of leisure with social distancing.
Possibility to Develop a Treatment/Vaccine. The development of a vaccine
or successful treatment would reduce the mortality rate of the disease and potentially
decrease its attack rate. A higher probability of treatment or vaccine would reduce total
costs of the herd approach by limiting its duration. We consider this outcome to be
unlikely given the absence of vaccines or effective treatments for other coronaviruses.
Incomplete Risk Sharing. If an arbitrary reallocation of money is possible between different individuals, then the approach with lowest total costs can make ev11

existing plans consider wide-scale redistribution. In this conditions, other measures can
give more accurate description of welfare gains and losses, such as ex ante expected
utility in a heterogeneous agent model.
