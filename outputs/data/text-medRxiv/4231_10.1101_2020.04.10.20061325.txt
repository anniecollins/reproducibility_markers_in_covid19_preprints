Abstract: Treatments are desperately needed to lower the hospitalization and case fatality rates
of SARS CoV-2 infection. In order to meaningfully impact the COVID-19 pandemic, promising
antiviral therapies must be identified within the next several months. However, the number of
clinical trials that can be performed in this timeframe is limited. We therefore developed a
mathematical model which allows projection of all possible therapeutic approaches. Our model
recapitulates off-treatment viral dynamics and predicts a three-phase immune response. Addition
of treatment with remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, neutralizing antibodies or cellular
immunotherapy demonstrates that if in vivo drug potency is high, then rapid elimination of virus
is possible. Potent therapies dosed soon after peak viral load when infected people typically
develop symptoms, are predicted to decrease shedding duration and intensity of the effector
immune response, but to have little effect on viral area under the curve, which is driven by high
levels of early SARS CoV-2 replication. Potent therapy dosed prior to peak viral load, when
infection is usually pre-symptomatic, is predicted to be the only option to lower viral area under
the curve. We also identify that clinically meaningful drug resistance is less likely to emerge
with a highly potent agent that is dosed after peak viral load. Our results support an early test and
treat approach for COVID-19, but also demonstrate the need to identify early viral shedding
kinetic features that are the most predictive surrogates of clinical severity and transmission risk.

Introduction:
The COVID-19 pandemic is a devastating historical event which is currently impacting
nearly all of mankind. SARS CoV-2 incidence is surging in numerous cities and countries across
the globe (1), and infection carries a high mortality rate, particularly among the elderly (2-4).
While social distancing has slowed and even eliminated many local epidemics, it is not an
economically viable long-term strategy (5). There is no evidence of widespread herd immunity
and a vaccine is unlikely to be developed and implemented within the next 18 months.
Therefore, second and third waves of infection are likely to occur over the next two years (6).
It is imperative that optimal treatment strategies of COVID-19 are identified during the
first wave of infection to ensure that the case fatality rate is lower during subsequent local
epidemics. To date, selection of antiviral agents has been empirical and guided by limited or
absent data. The window to conduct definitive clinical trials is likely to be narrow given that
flatten the curve efforts are predicted to slow local epidemics, albeit temporarily. Therefore,
effective tools are urgently needed to optimize the design of these trials.
Here we use mathematical models to project the possible impact of two small molecular
agents, remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine; as well as broadly neutralizing antibodies and
cellular immunotherapies. The goal of our models is to interpret emerging clinical trial data, and
in turn to perfect subsequent trials in terms of selection of antiviral agents, timing of therapy,
dosage, treatment duration, avoidance of drug resistance and selection of virologic endpoints.
Overall, our simulations support initiation of therapy soon after symptoms develop and also
suggest the urgent need for studies to identify virologic surrogates of SARS CoV-2 severity.

Results:
SARS CoV-2 natural history
We used four datasets of SARS CoV-2 shedding in the absence of effective treatment to
develop and validate a mathematical model. This data included 25 infected people: 11 from
Singapore (7), 9 from Germany (8), one from Korea (9), and 4 from France (10) (Fig 1).
Notably, sampling techniques differed across studies. In Singapore, Korea and France, samples
were obtained with nasopharyngeal swabs, whereas in Germany viral loads were measured
directly from sputum. Shedding was notable for an early peak, followed by three phases of viral
decay including a rapid initial decline from peak, a slower period of decay of variable length,
followed by a third abrupt elimination of the low levels of remaining virus. Of note, we only
captured the viral peak as well as the final rapid clearance phase in a subset of study participants.
There was one example of substantial, transient viral re-expansion (G7 in Fig 1).
SARS CoV-2 mathematical model
We developed a series of ordinary differential equations to fit to the viral load data (Fig.
1a, Methods and Materials). The equations capture the coupled interactions of susceptible
cells, infected cells, SARS CoV-2 and a mounting immune response. In keeping with the
standard viral dynamics model (11, 12), virus enters susceptible cells and converts them to
infected dells which then produce virus at a fixed rate. Based on model fitting, we included two
immune responses. The first accounts for the rate of infected cell elimination by the innate
immune system and is governed by an exponent; in keeping with prior research, we refer to this
as the density-dependent immune response (13, 14). The second phase is a slower cytolytic
response in which per cell killing rate saturates once the total number of effector cells exceeds a
certain level. We model this with stages of presumed effector cell precursors which differentiate
at rate q as a method to calibrate timing.
Our model reproduced viral load kinetics in all 25 participants (Fig. 1b). In certain cases,
the model only fit to available data from the later stages of shedding, whereas it recapitulated the
entirety of viral expansion, peak and decelerating clearance for several study participants (S5,
S14, S18, G1, G2, G5, G7). In keeping with observations from a recent clinical trial (15), low
level shedding continued past 20 days for some German participants (G1, G2, G3, G5, G6),
whereas viral elimination occurred in the remaining infected people.
Timing of innate and acquired cytolytic responses
We continuously quantified the value of the immune terms in all 25 participants: the per
cell killing rate and total number of cells killed per day was extremely high during the first
several days of infection in all participants (Fig. 2a, b), coinciding with peak viral load. The
cytolytic immune response initiated at various timepoints across participants (day 5-17) and led
to lower per cell and total killing rates relative to the innate response but was sufficient to
eliminate remaining infection (Fig. 2b).
Remdesivir pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics

We developed a pharmacokinetic / pharmacodynamic model of remdesivir (Fig. 3a), a
broad-spectrum nucleotide analogue that targets SARS CoV-2 replication in infected cells (16).
The model links intravenous administration with plasma levels of free drug and concentrations of
the drug’s active nucleotide-triphosphate component (NTP) observed within PBMCs in nonhuman primates (17), and captures the slow decay of NTP within this compartment (Fig. 3b).
With multiple doses, we project stable levels of NTP in target cells over time (Fig. 3c) followed
by slow decay after cessation of treatment.
We next simulated possible dose response curves of antiviral efficacy, which capture the
percentage of viral replication eliminated, according to micromolar concentration of drug. The
percent of viral replication suppression at a given intracellular drug concentration is dependent
on the intracellular EC50 of the drug, or the concentration of drug required to lower viral
replication by 50% (Fig 3d). Of note the intracellular EC50 is unknown for remdesivir,
particularly in vivo, making predictions of clinical trial outcomes impossible.
Finally, we combined the PK and PD models as in Fig. 3a to project the percentage of
viral replication inhibited over time at different assumed intracellular EC50 values (18, 19). With
high assumed drug potency (EC50=0.8 uM), antiviral effect are sustained over the 10-day dosing
interval and are maintained for a long period once drug delivery has stopped (Fig. 3e). At higher
assumed EC50 values, remdesivir potency is projected to be lower.
Projections of SARS CoV-2 outcomes assuming remdesivir treatment during early and late
symptomatic phases
We next simulated therapy at day 10 of infection (Fig. 4a), when severely infected people
often seek hospital care, and at day 5 of infection immediately after viral peak (Fig. 4b), when
infected people often become symptomatic. In both cases, when remdesivir in vivo potency was
assumed to be high (EC50=0.8 uM), viral elimination occurred rapidly after initiation of therapy.
This effect occurred because of unopposed removal of approximately 100-1000 infected cells per
day by an ongoing innate immune response (Fig. 2b).
Simulations with the assumption of a less potent version of remdesivir (EC50= 8 or 80
uM) resulted in a lower viral clearance slope. This result implies that viral clearance slope in
clinical trials can be used in concert with our model to directly estimate the in vivo intracellular
EC50 value of remdesivir in each treated patient. The model can then be used to project the
effect of increasing or decreasing doses in subsequent trials.
Projections of SARS CoV-2 outcomes assuming extremely early remdesivir treatment during the
pre-symptomatic phase
We next performed simulations of therapy at very early timepoints during infection at
and prior to peak viral load. Most infected people are pre-symptomatic at this stage so these
model realizations may most closely reflect implementation of a post exposure prophylaxis
strategy in which some people are already in the very early stages of infection at the time of first
dose. Under this scenario, extremely potent (EC50=0.8 uM) therapies at day 2 and 0 of infection
resulted in immediate viral suppression (Fig. 4c, d). With early, low or moderate potency
treatment, the model predicted therapeutic failure with persistent SARS CoV-2 shedding due to
insufficient early immunity against the virus (Fig. 4d).

Projections of short course remdesivir
We next repeated the above exercise with a shorter 5-day course of treatment. Results
were similar though simulations under the assumption of extremely early initiation of therapy did
not lead to full SARS CoV-2 suppression within this timeframe (Fig. S1).
Predictors of therapeutic efficacy for remdesivir
We next assessed which unknown variables in our therapeutic model were most
predictive of relevant therapeutic outcomes. As independent variables, we selected in vivo
intracellular EC50, because the potency of remdesivir against SARS CoV-2 in humans is
unknown, and infection duration at the time of treatment initiation. As dependent variables, we
selected shedding duration and viral area under the curve because it is unclear which of these
outcomes is a stronger predictor of progression to cytokine storm and respiratory failure, as well
as transmissibility, in infected people. We also included the final tally of effector cells as this
outcome may also be predictive of likelihood of cytokine storm (20).
Early initiation of a highly potent therapy was predictive of lower shedding duration
whether given in the pre-peak asymptomatic phase or in the post-peak symptomatic phase
beyond day 2-4 of infection. However, extremely early initiation of a lower potency therapy was
predicted to prolong shedding relative to no treatment (Fig. 5a).
Both high drug potency and extremely early treatment initiation during the presymptomatic stage of infection were required to significantly lower viral area under the curve.
Even highly potent therapy during the earliest symptomatic phase at days 4-5 had only a slight
impact on viral area under the curve, reflecting the fact that most virus and infected cells are
generated during the first 2-3 days of SARS CoV-2 infection (Fig. 5b).
Finally, initiation of a highly potent therapy within 6 days of infection lowered the extent
of the effector cell response in our simulations (Fig. 5c) which may suggest that an early test and
treat strategy could lower deleterious infection associated inflammation.
Theoretical kinetics of drug resistant variants
Based on the mutation rate of positive ss RNA viruses of approximately 10-5 mutations
per base pair per cell infection (21), and on the fact that two separate mutations may induce
partial remdesivir resistance in SARS CoV-1 which in turn leads to a less fit virus (22), we
estimated the probability that a drug resistant mutant would emerge during therapy. When we
assumed a potent therapy (EC50=0.8), the model projects that while single and double mutants
will emerge, they are unlikely to predominate or meaningfully extend duration of shedding if
dosed during the symptomatic phase of disease, though resistance may emerge with early dosing
(Fig. 6a,b). However, if a moderate potency is assumed, then a single mutant with resistant is
predicted to persist, particularly if therapy is initiated before or during viral peak (Fig. 7a,b).
If we assume that a single point mutation in SARS CoV-2 could theoretically induce
complete resistance, then treatment failure may occur regardless of dose timing. The resistant
strain is predicted to predominate raising the possibility of transmitted drug resistance (Fig. S2).
Hydroxychloroquine treatment predictions.

Using a multi-compartment PK/PD model for hydroxychloroquine (Fig. S3a), we first
recapitulated drug levels of the drug over time following a single dose (Fig. S3b), simulated
twice daily doses over 10 days (Fig. S3c), generated theoretical dose response curves (Fig. S3d),
and then projected drug efficacy over time (Fig. S3e). As with remdesivir, the predicted efficacy
of therapy on shedding depended on timing of treatment and the intracellular in vivo EC50 (Fig.
S4a-e). Lowering the area under the curve again required extremely early initiation of potent
treatment (Fig. S4f) while decreasing the number of effector cells required effective dosing
within the first 5 days of infection (Fig. S4g).
Broadly neutralizing antibody predictions. We next simulated a single infusion of broadly
neutralizing antibodies with prolonged half-life. Broadly neutralizing antibodies are designed to
stop infection of new cells rather than eliminate viral replication. We used a dual compartment
PK model for (Fig. S5a), estimated antibody levels over time following a single dose (Fig. S5b),
generated theoretical dose response curves (Fig. S5c), and then projected antibody efficacy over
time (Fig. S5d). The predicted efficacy of therapy on shedding again was dependent on timing of
treatment and the in vivo EC50 (Fig. S6a-d). Once again, to lower duration of shedding and the
number of effector cells depended on therapeutic potency, while effective lowering of viral area
under the curve required extremely early initiation of potent treatment (Fig. S6e-g).
Immunotherapy predictions. We generalized the potential effects of a cellular immunotherapy
which would presumably decrease the lifespan of infected cells. We projected that such an
intervention would need to increase this rate 10-fold to match the efficacy of a potent small
molecular agent. (Fig. S7a-c). Immunotherapies were projected to have no efficacy if started
prior to peak shedding (Fig. S7d).

Discussion
SARS CoV-2 infection is characterized by a stereotypical viral kinetic pattern with a high
peak viral load during the first several days of infection, a subsequent short rapid decay period
followed by a slower clearance phase of variable duration, and a final, rapid elimination phase.
Our mathematical model reproduces this data and explains that the transition from first to second
phase viral decay is governed by a density dependent term in which a massive die off of infected
cells occurs during peak viremia. Viral clearance rate slows considerably once the viral load
decreases below a threshold of ~105 RNA copies. A late slowly expanding cytolytic T cell
response is predicted to induce eradication of infected cells in the upper airway 2-20 days later.
The timing of this final response appears to be variable among infected people. Moreover, it is
unknown if cessation of viral replication in the nasopharynx guarantees the same result in the
lung or other anatomic compartments (8).
We built therapy simulations on top of these natural kinetics to glean knowledge about
the possible impact of antiviral therapies. While accurate prediction is impossible in the absence
of clinical trial data, we are able to make several observations which highlight the importance of
off treatment viral dynamics in understanding treatment effects. Our results can guide future
study design and assist in interpretation of forthcoming trial data in multiple ways.
First, it is critical to know whether in vitro potency assessments of remdesivir,
hydroxycholorquine and bNAbs can be projected onto human infection. We previously
demonstrated that in vivo IC50 values for antiviral agents can exceed estimates derived from cell
cultures experiments by a multiple of 5-10 for small molecule antiviral drugs (19). A similar
observation has been hypothesized for HIV targeting monoclonal neutralizing antibodies (23). It
is unclear if this discrepancy occurs due to low blood levels in tissue, different cell metabolism
of drug in tissue or higher protein binding in vivo. Whatever the case, if in vitro potency
measurements of hydroxycholoroquine and remdesivir overestimate in vivo activity, or if higher
intracellular levels are required than in plasma, then these drugs may be less effective in clinical
trials. Higher dosing may be a possible solution to circumvent this issue.
Second, effective dosing after symptom development predicts rapid subsequent
elimination of infected. Most current clinical trials are focused primarily on hospitalized patients
whereas our results and those from other COVID models suggest that treatment in the days
immediately following symptom onset will decrease the duration of detectable viral shedding
(24, 25). Our model also predicts that early treatment will limit the extent of the cytolytic
immune response required to clear infection. If either of these outcomes are correlates of
progression to severe disease and transmission risk, then as with HIV (26), influenza (27), and
Ebola (28), early test and treat is a vital, currently overlooked strategy.
Third, effective dosing soon after onset of symptoms is predicted to have an insignificant
effect on viral load AUC. This phenomenon occurs because the amount of virus produced per
hour at the early peak is far higher than the amount produced per day during the lower viral load
second decay phase. This finding provides a cautionary message: if subsequent disease severity
and development is imprinted during the high viral load, pre-symptomatic phase of infection,
then early antiviral therapy could theoretically eliminate further shedding without altering
clinical outcomes. Moreover, if extremely high viral load periods are responsible for most
transmissions as suggested by the 5-day generation time of infection (29), then early elimination
of shedding may not lower transmissibility either. Overall this result highlights the urgent need
for studies which identify early viral and immune correlates of severe disease and

transmissibility. Indeed, preliminary studies suggest that presenting viral load may impact
disease severity (30).
Fourth, if therapy is initiated during the pre-symptomatic stage of infection as may occur
during post exposure prophylaxis (31), then its effectiveness is predicated on high potency.
Subtherapeutic small molecular agents may in fact prolong infection. Based on this result, we
suggest sampling at late timepoints during post exposure prophylaxis trials.
Fifth, our approach suggests that while development of low-level drug resistance will
occur commonly during COVID-19 treatment with remdesivir, it is unlikely to predispose to
treatment failure provided the drug is potent against the predominant susceptible strain. Resistant
variants will likely be present at low levels relative to susceptible strains making transmission of
resistance far less likely. Important exceptions may occur in immunocompromised hosts who
might shed respiratory viruses for longer and at higher levels, thereby increasing the chance of de
novo resistance (32), or in the context of only moderately potent antiviral therapy.
Finally, our model projects a high likelihood of success for neutralizing antibodies and
cellular immunotherapies provided that they achieve adequate potency and are dosed early.
In summary, our model provides a broad platform for assessment of all major types of
therapies. Our results demonstrate the need to differentiate whether duration of viral shedding or
viral area under the curve is the more relevant surrogate of severity. If viral area under the curve
is most predictive of poor outcomes, then all forms of antiviral therapy outside of potent post
exposure prophylaxis are unlikely to provide clinical benefit. However, if shedding duration is
the best surrogate, then an early test and treat approach is highly promising for limiting the
likelihood of severe disease.

Materials and Methods
Study design
We employed ordinary differential equation models to analyze the in-host SARS CoV-2
dynamics in infected individuals and the potential in vivo effect of different treatment strategies.
First, we fit models to the viral load data from different sources using a nonlinear-mixed effects
approach. Second, we used pharmacokinetics models to fits observed plasma concentration of
remdesivir (RDV) and its active nucleoside triphosphate form in PBMCs, and blood
concentration of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). Third, we simulated dose response curves for
antiviral effect of RDV and HCQ using different possible half maximal effective concentration
(EC50) based on in-vitro estimations against SARS-CoV-2. Fourth, we simulated therapy at
different times during infection to analyze the potential reduction of SARS CoV-2 shedding.
Finally, we repeated projections of therapy including the emergence of resistance to therapy.
SARS CoV-2 viral load data
We analyzed viral load data from patients infected with SARS CoV-2 that were
monitored and received supported therapy in hospitals in Singapore (n=11), Germany (n=9),
South Korea (n=1), and France (n=4). Patients who had less than 4 data points or had oscillatory
viral dynamics were excluded.
The first data set was obtained from SARS Cov-2-infected patients followed at 4 hospital
in Singapore from January 23rd to February 23rd, 2020 (7). All patients diagnosed stated to have
travelled from Wuhan, China in the last two weeks of enrollment. Viral load observations were
obtained from different specimens (blood, stool, and urine samples), but we analyzed those
coming from nasopharyngeal swabs. Cycle threshold were obtained with reverse transcriptase
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at multiple times during the first 2 weeks after enrollment.
The second data set was obtained from infected patients enrolled and treated in a single
hospital in Munich, Germany from January 23rd to January 27th, 2020 (8). For all patients, the
infection was reported to happen after contact with an index case. Viral load observations were
obtained daily from sputum, pharyngeal swabs and stool using RT-PCR. Here, we analyzed viral
RNA concentrations from sputum.
The third data set comes from the first SARS Cov-2 infected case in Korea, a 35-year-old
Chinese citizen coming from Wuhan, China (9). Nasopharyngeal swabs viral loads were
obtained daily from day 2 of symptoms onset using RT-PCR.
The fourth data set came from four patients admitted in hospitals in Paris or Bordeaux,
France with viral loads obtained from nasopharyngeal swabs using RT-PCR (10). We analyzed
viral load data digitized from the published study.
When viral load observations were only published in cycle threshold (Ct) values we
converted them to copies per swab using the relation values in (33). We assumed a lower limit of
detection of 100 copies per sample.
Pharmacokinetic data
PK data of HCQ specifically to 200 mg oral dose was gathered from (34). PK data of
RDV was gathered from (17), where non-Human Primates (NHPs) intravenously received RDV

at 10mg/kg dose at day 0 and the plasma concentration of RDV and its active nucleoside
triphosphate form in PBMCs were recorded over 24 hours. We digitize this data and employ it to
fit PK model of RDV.
Mathematical modeling of SARS-COV-2 dynamics
To understand the observed SARS-COV-2 shedding dynamics we developed a viral
infection model modifying previous models of virus dynamics (12, 35-37). In this model,
susceptible cells (S) are infected at rate 𝛽𝑉𝑆 by SARS-COV-2 (V). SARS-COV-2-infected cells
(I) are cleared in two ways: (1) by an innate response with density dependent rate 𝛿𝐼 ! (13, 14);
"# !

and (2) an acquired response with rate # ! $%! mediated by SARS-COV-2-specific effector cells

(𝐸). The exponent 𝑘 describes by how much the first death rate depends on the infected cell
density. The Hill coefficient 𝑟 parameterizes the nonlinearity of the second response and allows
for rapid saturation of the killing. Parameter 𝜙 defines the effector cell level by which killing of
infected cells by 𝐸 is half maximal. SARS-COV-2 is produced at a rate 𝜋 and cleared with rate
𝛾. In the model, SARS-COV-2-specific effector cells rise after 𝑛 stages from precursors cells
(𝑀'()…+ ). The first precursor cell compartment (𝑀) ) proliferates in the presence of infection
with rate 𝜔𝐼𝑀) and differentiates into the effector cell at a per capita rate 𝑞 during each
intermediate stage. Finally, effector cells die at rate 𝛿# . The best instance of the model is
expressed as a schematic (Fig. 1a) and here as a system of ordinary differential equations:

Fitting viral load data and model selection
We fit different instances of our model in equation 1 to the SARS-COV-2 shedding data
using a nonlinear mixed-effects modeling approach (38-40) (See Table S1). Briefly, we obtained
a maximum likelihood estimation of the population median (fixed effects) and standard deviation
(random effects) for each model parameter using the Stochastic Approximation Expectation
Maximization (SAEM) algorithm embedded in the Monolix 2019R2 software (www.lixoft.eu).
For a subset of parameters, random effects were specified, and the standard deviation values
were estimated. Measurement error variance was also estimated assuming an additive error
model for the logged 𝑉. We simultaneously fit each model to the viral load data of 25 patients
form the four data sets. The parameters associated with the effector cell compartment were only
estimated for those study participants who cleared infection during the observed data.
For each model fit we assumed 𝑡 = 0 as the time of first positive viral load for each
person. However, we defined the initial value as the time of infection, i.e. when 𝐼(𝑡'+'. ) = 1 cell.

Since infection starts before the first detected viral load, we have that 𝑡'+'. < 0. We fixed other

𝐸(𝑡'+'. ) = 0. We fixed parameter 𝛾 = 15 day-1 (41), 𝛿# = 1 day-1 (35), and 𝜙 = 100 cells. We
assumed this value of 𝜙 because of the low percentage (~2%) of activated T cells that start
growing at the moment of viral load drop (42). We estimated the remaining parameters including
the time of infection 𝑡'+'. .
To determine the most parsimonious model among the instances for the available SARS
Cov-2 shedding data, we computed the log-likelihood (log L) and the Akaike Information
Criteria (AIC=-2log L+2m, where m is the number of parameters estimated). We assumed a
model has similar support from the data if the difference between its AIC and the best model
(lowest) AIC is less than two (43).
Pharmacokinetic modeling of remdesivir
To reproduce the PK data of RDV, we employed a simple two compartment model
where the first compartment represents the amount of RDV in plasma (𝐶9 , volume 𝑉9 ) and the
second compartment denotes the amount of its active nucleoside triphosphate form in PBMCs
(𝐶: , volume 𝑉: ). Here, we assume that RDV gets metabolized to its active nucleoside
triphosphate form at rate 𝑘;: whereas RDV and its active nucleoside triphosphate form are
eliminated from their respective compartments at rates 𝑘< and 𝑘: , respectively. The model is
given by,

As the drug concentration was recorded in 𝜇M, we convert the amount of the drug given
in mg to 𝜇M by dividing 𝐶9 and 𝐶: by conversion factors 𝑉) and 𝑉8 , respectively. Here, 𝑉) and
𝑉8 are a combination of the volume of the distribution of two compartments and the molar mass
of two forms of RDV.
We fit this model to the PK data from NHP (17), using a non-linear least squares
approach using an initial dose of 10mg/kg. We adapted the dose in humans (200mg and 100mg)
assuming a normal weight of 70kg.
Pharmacokinetic modeling of hydroxychloroquine
To recapitulate the pharmacokinetics of HCQ, we developed a model on
pharmacokinetics models of chloroquine (CQ), as HCQ is a derivate of CQ and has the same
active metabolites (44). In this four-compartment model, the drug gets absorbed from the gut
compartment (𝐴= ) at rate 𝑘: and enters the central compartment (𝐴9 , with volume 𝑉) ), where it
is eliminated with at a rate 𝑘< . The rate constants 𝑘)8 and 𝑘)> represent the movement of the
drug from the central compartment to the first peripheral compartment (𝐴8 , volume 𝑉8 ) and the
first peripheral compartment (𝐴> , volume 𝑉> ), respectively. Similarly, the movement of the drug
from compartments 𝐴8 and 𝐴> to the central compartment is modelled using 𝑘8) and 𝑘>) ,
respectively. The modeling equations representing the amount of drug in each compartment is
given by,

Pharmacokinetic modeling of broadly neutralizing antibodies
The pharmacokinetics of a intravenously injected broadly neutralizing antibody (bNAB)

this model 𝑘) ad 𝑘8 represent the distribution and clearance rates of the bNAB whereas 𝑌) and 𝑌8
describe the coefficients associated with them. We fixed parameters 𝑌) = 2200 𝜇𝑔/mL, 𝑌8 =
150 𝜇𝑔/mL and 𝑘) = 1.1 day-1 following estimates for the bNAb VRC01 (23). We also fixed

Remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine are assumed to inhibit viral production rate (𝜋) whereas
bNABs are hypothesized to inhibit the viral infectivity (𝛽), both by a factor of 1 − 𝜖(𝑡).
To calculate the efficacy of remdesivir, we assume that the active form (𝐶: ) has the

Modeling the emergence of resistance to remdesivir
We adapted the model in equation 1 to allow for the emergence of resistance to RDV.
We base the modifications on the fact that two separate mutations may induce partial resistance

to RDV in SARS CoV-1 which in turn leads to a less fit virus (22). In the case of SARS Cov-1,
two single mutations can induce to a less sensitive virus with 2.4- and 5.0-fold increase in the
RDV EC50. When the combined mutations emerged, it mediated a 5.6-fold increase in the RDV
EC50. We included these findings in the model by assuming that infected cells (𝐼H ) that produce
sensitive virus (𝑉H ) can transition into infected cells (𝐼I) and 𝐼I8 ) that produce less sensitive virus
(𝑉I) and 𝑉I8 ), due to one mutation during the viral replication cycle. These two viral populations
have an increased EC50 (2.4- and 5-fold higher). Similarly, we assumed that 𝐼I) and 𝐼I8 can
transition into infected cells that produce a more resistant strain 𝑉I)8 (with 5.6-fold higher EC50)
after another mutation. We also allowed for reversal mutation events. We assumed a mutation
probability of 𝜇 = 102F per infection event. Under these assumptions total viral load is defined
as 𝑉 = 𝑉H + 𝑉I) + 𝑉I8 + 𝑉I)8 and total number of infected cells as 𝐼 = 𝐼H + 𝐼I) + 𝐼I8 + 𝐼I)8 .
