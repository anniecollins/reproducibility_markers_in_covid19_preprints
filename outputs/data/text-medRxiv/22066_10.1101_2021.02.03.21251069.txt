ABSTRACT (275 words)
Background
People with autoimmune or inflammatory conditions who take immunomodulatory/suppressive
medications may have a higher risk of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Chronic disease care
has also changed for many patients, with uncertain downstream consequences.

Objective
Assess whether COVID-19 risk is higher among those on immunomodulating or suppressive agents and
characterize pandemic-associated changes to care.

Design
Longitudinal registry study

Participants
4666 individuals with autoimmune or inflammatory conditions followed by specialists in neurology,
rheumatology, cardiology, pulmonology or gastroenterology at Johns Hopkins

Measurements
Periodic surveys querying comorbidities, disease-modifying medications, exposures, COVID-19 testing
and outcomes, social behaviors, and disruptions to healthcare

Results
A total of 265 (5.6%) developed COVID-19 over 9 months of follow-up (April-December 2020). Patient
characteristics (age, race, comorbidity, medication exposure) were associated with differences in social
distancing behaviors during the pandemic. Glucocorticoid exposure was associated with higher odds of
COVID-19 in multivariable models incorporating behavior and other potential confounders (OR: 1.43;
95%CI: 1.08, 1.89). Other medication classes were not associated with COVID-19 risk. Diabetes (OR:
1.72; 95%CI: 1.08, 2.73), cardiovascular disease (OR: 1.68; 95%CI: 1.24, 2.28), and chronic kidney disease
(OR: 1.76; 95%CI: 1.04, 2.97) were each associated with higher odds of COVID-19. Pandemic-related

disruption to care was common. Of the 2156 reporting pre-pandemic utilization of infusion, mental
health or rehabilitative services, 975 (45.2%) reported disruptions. Individuals experiencing changes to
employment or income were at highest odds of care disruption.

Limitations
Results may not be generalizable to all patients with autoimmune or inflammatory conditions.
Information was self-reported.

Conclusions
Exposure to glucocorticoids may increase risk of COVID-19 in people with autoimmune or inflammatory
conditions. Disruption to healthcare and related services was common. Those with pandemic-related
reduced income may be most vulnerable to care disruptions.

INTRODUCTION
In people with autoimmune or inflammatory conditions, there is concern that immunomodulatory
medications used to treat these conditions may increase the risk of developing novel coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19), as chronic immune suppression is associated with a higher risk of infection and
may be associated with poorer COVID-19 outcomes.1–7 Given the significant role of immune cell
activation and inflammation in severe COVID-19 disease, certain classes of these medications may also
have a protective role in this setting. A notable limitation of many existing studies is a failure to account
for social distancing behaviors (e.g., individuals taking stronger immune-modulating/suppressive
medications may perceive themselves to be at a higher COVID-19 risk and may be more likely to strictly
adhere to suggested social distancing guidelines and refrain from in-person socialization). Such
differences in behavior could potentially confound (or impact in unexpected ways) any estimates of
medication-associated risks. As a result, consideration of behavior remains a critical component in
analyses assessing COVID-19 risk associated with exposure to immunomodulatory/suppressive
medications.

Beyond COVID-19 disease-specific concerns, the pandemic has resulted in the disruption of longitudinal
care in many chronic conditions. For example, many patients have discontinued, lowered, or delayed
their medication or refrained from obtaining critical safety laboratory tests.8,9 Other patients
experienced disruptions to infusion, rehabilitative, homecare, or mental health services. Currently,
limited research has assessed 1) which patients are most vulnerable to care disruption and 2) the
downstream effects of these disruptions on disease outcomes. The impact of such changes may be very
significant as they may affect the majority of patients with autoimmune or inflammatory conditions, not
only those patients who develop COVID-19.

To address some of these critical gaps in knowledge and patient care, we established COVID-19 Risk with
Immune-modulating Medication Study (COVID-RIMS), which is a cohort study of nearly 5000 individuals
with a variety of autoimmune and inflammatory conditions who are managed as outpatients by
specialists at the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions. The primary goals of COVID-RIMS were to assess
whether the risk for COVID-19 is higher among those on immunomodulating or suppressive agents (after
accounting for behavior) and to quantify and identify consequences of pandemic-associated changes to
longitudinal outpatient care in this population.

METHODS
Study population
In April 2020, we established the COVID-RIMS research study. Eligible participants have autoimmune or
inflammatory conditions (included diagnoses listed in eTable 1) and had been seen by specialists in
neurology, rheumatology, cardiology, pulmonology or gastroenterology at Johns Hopkins since 2017.
Participants were identified as those with at least two ICD-10 codes associated with a particular disorder
in the electronic medical record (EMR) at two separate visits prior to study initiation. Patients were
invited to participate in COVID-RIMS through a patient-specific e-mail link. This study was conducted
following the International Conference on Harmonization guidelines for Good Clinical Practices, the
Declaration of Helsinki, as well as local requirements. Approval was obtained from the Institutional
Review Board at Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions.

Survey assessments
From April through June 2020, participants in COVID-RIMS answered weekly online questionnaires, and
from July 2020 onwards, participants completed surveys on an approximately monthly basis. Surveys
queried immunomodulatory medication exposure (both current and previous), COVID-19-related

symptoms, testing status and outcomes, weight and height (used to calculate body mass index [BMI] as
kg/m2), comorbid conditions, smoking status, employment (status and location: onsite versus remote),
personal and household contact social distancing practices, mask use, and socio-economic status (SES)
indicators. Indicators of SES included the area deprivation index (ADI), which is an established composite
index incorporating 17 measures of SES derived using geo-coded addresses; nationwide indices range
from 0 (least disadvantaged) to 100 (most disadvantaged).10,11 Surveys also assessed whether
participants had cancelled or postponed infusion visits, rehabilitative, homecare or mental health
services and the reason for the change (lack of available appointments, loss of insurance, COVID-19
exposure risk, or lack of transportation). Beginning in July, we also asked participants if they completed
COVID-19 serologic assessment and its outcomes. Also beginning in July, depression and anxiety were
also assessed using short-forms developed from the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement
Information System (PROMIS), which have been validated for populations living with chronic
conditions;12–15 raw responses to questionnaires were converted to T-scores, which have a population
mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10, with higher scores indicating greater depression or anxiety.

Assessment of COVID-19 disease
In each survey, participants were asked several COVID-19-related questions including whether 1) a
health provider ever suspected them of having COVID-19, 2) they had tested positive for COVID-19, or 3)
had received a positive COVID-19 serology assessment. In addition, Johns Hopkins also maintains a
COVID-19 registry in which all tests, results and COVID-19 outcomes performed within the state of
Maryland or District of Columbia (via the Chesapeake Regional Information System for our Patients
[CRISP], a regional health information exchange resource for Maryland/District of Columbia) are
automatically uploaded into a database designed for research; we linked participants in COVID-RIMS
with this registry to also allow for maximum case capture. Participants with self-reported positive

COVID-19 tests by nasal swab RT-PCR or serum antibody testing, self-reported healthcare provider
suspected COVID-19 (but were never tested) or had tested positive in CRISP were included as cases. We
performed sensitivity analyses excluding individuals with suspected COVID-19 from the case definition.

Statistical analysis
Initial analyses compared demographic characteristics of invited participants versus those who agreed
to participate. Baseline demographics, disease characteristics, and key comorbidities were reported with
descriptive statistics (e.g., mean and standard deviation [SD] for continuous variables and frequency and
percentage for categorical variables). Initial analyses evaluated non-medication associated risk factors
for COVID-19 and considered: age, sex, race, SES, working onsite, in-person socialization, smoking status,
number of autoimmune or inflammatory conditions, number of immune-modulating medications
exposures in the previous year and number of comorbidities using logistic regression models (as
participants did not report exact timing of infection and we included participants with positive COVID-19
antibody testing in which exact timing of infection may be less clear). For in-person socialization, we
considered both at baseline (when COVID-19 restrictions and business closures in Maryland and most of
the United States were at their peak) and during follow-up, when restrictions had been somewhat
relaxed. Comorbidities considered included hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease (CVD;
coronary heart disease, stroke, or heart failure), lung disease (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
[COPD], interstitial lung disease, or pulmonary hypertension), chronic kidney disease, asthma, and
obesity (BMI ≥ 30). We also considered comorbidity burden as the sum of individual comorbidities
affecting an individual. Primary analyses then assessed the association between exposure to different
classes of immunomodulatory agents and risk of COVID-19 adjusted for age, sex, race, SES, working
onsite, in person socialization, smoking status, number of autoimmune or inflammatory conditions and
comorbidity also using logistic regression models. We categorized immunomodulatory/suppressive

medications based on biologic class/mechanism or relative potency and considered the following
categories: tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-inhibitors (e.g., adalimumab, infliximab, etanercept), B-cell
depleting biologic agents (e.g., rituximab, ocrelizumab), other biologic therapies (e.g., natalizumab,
abatacept, tocilizumab), conventional disease modifying drugs (DMDs; e.g., leflunomide, methotrexate,
sulfasalazine,

interferon-beta),

hydroxychloroquine,

strong

immunosuppressants

(e.g.,

cyclophosphamide), glucocorticoids, and intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) or plasmapheresis. We
also assessed risk of COVID-19 associated with use of any biologic or non-biologic (e.g., collapsing the
strong immunosuppressant and conventional DMDs categories). A full list of individual medications
considered, and their associated category, are included in eTable 7. We also assessed risk of COVID-19
associated with medication classes stratified by disorders and individual medication exposures (as ever
exposed, exposure within the past 1 year, exposure over 1 year ago) for medication classes or
medications in which at least 10 COVID-19 cases were recorded. We also assessed predictors of
interruptions to care (any interruption over follow-up, interruption to infusion, mental health or
rehabilitative services, since these services are common in this population) using univariate and similarly
adjusted multivariable-adjusted models performed with logistic regression methods. Lastly, we
evaluated how depression and anxiety symptoms changed over the course of follow-up and evaluated
predictors of higher overall symptom burden using univariate and multivariable-adjusted mixed effects
models. Statistical calculations were performed with R software, version 3.6.2.16

RESULTS
We initially invited 22,516 eligible patients, of whom 4666 (20.9%) agreed to participate and have
completed at least one follow-up survey as of December 2020. Multiple sclerosis (MS), Sjogren's
syndrome, and rheumatoid arthritis were the most common autoimmune or inflammatory conditions
affecting participants with 878, 741, and 545 individuals, respectively (eTable 1). COVID-RIMS

participants were more likely to be female (76.7% vs. 72.3%), white (83.1% vs. 63.2%) and have higher
SES (mean ADI [SD] 23.7 [20.4] vs. 31.2 [24.4]) relative to those who did not respond to our survey
invitation (eTable 2). COVID-RIMS participants completed weekly (and later monthly) surveys for the
duration of follow-up for a total of 10 surveys (baseline + 9 follow-up surveys); the median number of
follow-up surveys completed was 8 (IQR: 5-9).

Table 1 summarizes characteristics of responders overall and by COVID-19 status; 2187 (46.7%) report
having been tested at least once for COVID-19 and 265 (5.7%) individuals reported positive COVID-19
results over the course of follow-up. For all responders, both those who developed COVID-19 and those
who did not, 4161 (89.1%) reported ever being treated with an immune-modulating/suppressing
medication, 167 (3.6%) were smokers, 1344 (28.8%) were obese, and 2736 (58.6%) had at least one
medical comorbidity potentially associated with more severe COVID-19 disease or COVID-19 related
hospitalization (e.g. hypertension, diabetes, CVD, lung diseases, chronic kidney disease [CKD], stroke,
cancer); of the medical comorbidities considered, hypertension (30.8%) and CVD (18.8%) were most
common.

Some patient characteristics were associated with differences in social distancing behaviors. For
example, younger individuals, men, non-white individuals, those with lower SES, those with a higher
comorbidity burden and those with exposure to a greater number of immune modulating/suppressing
agents were less likely to socialize in person over follow-up (eTable 3). For example, individuals exposed
to 3+ immune modulating/suppressing agents in the past year were 20% less likely to socialize in person
relative to those who did not report being on immunosuppression or immunomodulation medications in
the past year (OR: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.65, 0.97). In contrast, individuals working on site were over two-fold
more likely to report socializing in person (OR: 2.28; 95% CI: 1.96, 2.65).

Risk factors for contracting COVID-19
Younger age, comorbidity burden, working onsite and in-person socialization were each associated with
increased odds of COVID-19 in multivariable-adjusted models (Table 2). Individual comorbidities
including diabetes (OR: 1.72; 95% CI: 1.08, 2.73), CVD (OR: 1.68; 95% CI: 1.24, 2.28), CKD (OR: 1.76; 95%
CI: 1.04, 2.97) were also associated with COVID-19 odds in multivariable-adjusted models (eTable 4).
Results were similar when stratified by disorder; no significant heterogeneity when pooling results
across disorder for estimated ORs.

When considering immune medications, glucocorticoid use in the past year was associated with 43%
increased odds of COVID-19 (Figure 2; odds ratio [OR]: 1.43; 95% CI: 1.08, 1.89) in multivariable-adjusted
models. With respect to glucocorticoid dose (as the sum of prednisone, methylprednisolone, and
dexamethasone exposure), individuals reporting daily prednisone equivalent doses of 0.5 to 7.5mg/day,
7.5 to 60 mg/day and >60 mg/day had respective ORs of COVID-19 of 1.57 (95% CI: 1.06, 2.34), 1.60
(95% CI: 1.05, 2.44), and 1.95 (95% CI: 0.87, 4.39) relative to those with no exposure. (eTable 5). Results
were relatively consistent in analyses stratified by disorder (eTable 6). Beyond glucocorticoids, other
medication classes did not appear to be associated with COVID-19 risk. In sensitivity analyses, when we
reclassified sphingosine-1-phosphate inhibitors (S1P; ozanimod, siponimod, fingolimod) as strong
(rather than conventional) immunosuppressive agents or reclassified mycophenolate mofetil,
azathioprine, or mercaptopurine as conventional (rather than strong) DMD, it did not alter the findings
(for S1P: OR: 1.10; 95% CI: 0.81, 1.50; for mycophenolate mofetil: OR: 1.14; 95% CI: 0.73, 1.77; for
azathioprine: 1.19; 95% CI: 0.81, 1.73; for mercaptopurine: 1.13; 95% CI: 0.80, 1.60). Likewise, removing
natalizumab or vedolizumab from biologic therapies (as these therapies may not affect peripheral
immune responses) also did not alter findings (OR: 1.14; 95% CI: 0.73, 1.77). With the exception of

prednisone use in the past year (OR: 1.67; 95% CI: 1.21, 2.30), we did not find strong evidence of higher
odds of COVID-19 associated with other individual medications for which ≥10 COVID-19 cases occurred
among users (eTable 7).

Assessment of risk factors for COVID-19 were consistent when excluding individuals who were
suspected of having COVID-19 but were never tested (50 individuals excluded, leaving 215 COVID-19+
cases eligible for these analyses).

Interruptions to care or services
Of the 2156 individuals who reported receiving infusions, rehabilitative or mental health services prior
to the pandemic, 942 (45.2%) experienced an interruption to any services during the pandemic; 341 of
1158 (29.4%) delayed infusions, 623 of 1081 (57.6%) had an interruption in rehabilitative service, and
211 of 731 (28.8%) had interrupted mental healthcare (Table 3 and eTable 8). Those who experienced a
change in their ability to pay for disorder-associated costs were nearly 2-fold more likely to have an
interruption in services. Similarly, COVID-19-related changes to employment (e.g., furlough or
termination) were also associated with an increased risk of service interruption (OR: 1.34; 95% CI: 1.02,
1.76). Those with moderate to severe anxiety (as defined as >1 SD above the mean T-scores from
PROMIS measures) were 53% more likely to report an interruption in services (OR: 1.53; 95% CI: 1.20,
1.94). Men were less likely to experience an interruption in services (OR: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.64, 0.99).
Findings were generally similar when considering specific reasons for disruption to services (e.g.,
infusions, rehabilitative services, or mental health).

Overall burden of anxiety and depression and change over follow-up

On average, participants reported anxiety and depressive symptom T-scores of 51.8 [9.5] and 49.9 [8.5],
respectively. Younger participants, men, and Black/African Americans tended to report a lower burden
of anxiety and depression over the course of follow-up (e.g., lower T-scores), while previous selfreported previous physician-diagnosed depression was associated with substantially higher anxiety and
depression symptom burden (Table 4). Several pandemic-associated factors were also associated with
higher symptom levels. For example, pandemic-associated changes in ability to pay for disorderassociated costs were associated with 2.17 (1.33, 3.01) points higher anxiety and 2.45 (1.70, 3.20) points
higher depressive symptom T-scores. COVID-19 related changes to employment were also associated
with small increases in anxiety and depressive symptoms, though it’s possible these changes may not be
clinically meaningful (for anxiety: 0.73 points higher; 95% CI: 0.10, 1.35; for depression: 0.80; 95% CI:
0.25, 1.34).

Over the course of follow-up, the burden of depression and anxiety symptoms changed non-linearly.
Peak anxiety levels occurred in November (Figure 2; 2.00 points higher; 95% CI: 1.60, 2.39). Depressive
symptoms peaked slightly in August (0.97 points higher; 95% CI: 0.66, 1.28), though this difference may
not be clinically meaningful. Changes in anxiety and depression occurring over follow-up were similar
across different conditions and across different medication classes.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we assessed risk factors for COVID-19 among a large cohort of patients with known
autoimmune or inflammatory conditions in a well-phenotyped prospective registry at Johns Hopkins.
Adherence to in person socialization recommendations were non-uniformly distributed across patients.
Consistent with existing evidence, individuals working onsite or who are socializing in-person had a
higher risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 and developing COVID-19 disease. In addition, having diabetes,

With

to

immunomodulatory/suppressive medications, any glucocorticoid use in the past year was associated
with an increased risk of COVID-19; other medications classes or individual medications themselves did
not appear to be associated with COVID-19 risk. Our results were consistent in sensitivity analyses,
where we varied both definitions for medication exposure as well as COVID-19 outcomes. Beyond
COVID-19 disease, general interruptions to healthcare were common; individuals who experienced
changes in their ability to pay for disorder-associated costs as well as those who experienced a COVID19-related change to employment were most vulnerable to care disruptions. Overall, these findings
suggest that as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to cause considerable morbidity and mortality, people
with autoimmune or inflammatory disorders may be a particularly vulnerable population.

Results suggest that exposure to glucocorticoids may increase risk of contracting COVID-19. We did note
a potential non-linear association between total glucocorticoid dose and COVID-19 risk. This observation
is notable as glucocorticoids were among the most common medications used in this population, and
many previous studies suggest a link between chronic exposure to glucocorticoids exposure and
infection risk in people with autoimmune or inflammatory disorders.17–20 Also notable was our finding
that other common medication classes were not strongly associated with COVID-19 infection. While it’s
likely our sample size and number of identified COVID-19 cases precluded us from identifying the true
COVID-19 risk associated with all of the DMDs considered, strong signals were not identified for more
broad classifications of many of the common DMDs in this population. In the MS population, some prior
studies had indicated an association between anti-CD20 therapy use and risk of COVID-19; these studies,
while accounting for comorbidities, did not account for social distancing behaviors, which as we
observed were non-uniformly distributed across patients.1,2,7,21 At the same time, the populations
studied (in Europe) may have other characteristics that underlie the different outcomes. Most

publications evaluating risk in other autoimmune disease evaluated risk of more severe disease rather
than illness as a whole or used study designs that were less optimal (e.g., cross-sectional, casecontrol).8,22,23 With the success of recent COVID-19 vaccine trials, a critical next step will be to determine
if and how common immunomodulating/suppressive medications or specific medication classes (e.g., Bcell depleting therapies) affect vaccination response, as has been shown for other vaccines.24,25

Notably, nearly half of participants who reported receiving infusion, rehabilitative, or mental health
services reported a pandemic-related disruption to care. These results set the stage for future studies
assessing the downstream consequences of these changes to autoimmune or inflammatory diseasespecific outcomes, especially, as certain subgroups of patients (e.g., those with changes to household
income) may be particularly vulnerable to these potential effects.

Finally, we also note non-linear changes in the burden of depression and anxiety. The sharp decrease in
the trend of symptom burden between November and December could be related to announcements of
the success of large COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness trials, which occurred in this period. It is also worth
noting that the burden of mental health comorbidities is generally higher in many autoimmune and
inflammatory disease populations relative to the general population;26–30 extended periods of social
isolation may exaggerate symptoms of depression and anxiety in an already vulnerable population, an
important observation for providers to keep in mind when caring for individuals with these conditions.

Our study has a number of important strengths. Our study is relatively distinct from prior research
studies of individuals taking immune medications, which have largely focused on risk factors for poor
COVID-19 outcomes. We included a large population of nearly 5000 individuals with autoimmune or
inflammatory conditions who are already followed by specialists at a large health system, and, thus, may

limit some biases related to right censoring that may be inherent to other studies including only
hospitalized patients. Importantly, our study was also longitudinal and included information from
patients collected at 10 different time points over the course of follow-up. We also included
assessments of social distancing behavior to incorporate into analyses to ensure that any observed
differences in medication-associated risks were not driven by differences of behavior. We also
performed several sets of sensitivity analyses in which we assessed how varying assumptions of our
analyses could impact the findings and our conclusions. Lastly, surveys included information related to
disruptions to care, which may be particularly notable as these concerns affected a substantial
proportion of participating patients. To date, most reports have focused on recommendations from
providers, whereas our study collected such information on the observed burden in patients, which we
found to be non-uniform across different subgroups of patients.

A number of important limitations of our study are worth noting. First, we lacked detailed information
on exact timing of COVID-19 infection, so could not incorporate this information into the analyses or
assess potential time-varying risk factors or confounding. We also could miss potential COVID-19 cases if
participants were loss to follow-up or were not tested for COVID-19 in the Maryland/District of
Columbia area, although, follow-up was relatively complete with participants completing a median 8 of
9 follow-up surveys. Further, we used self-reported medications, comorbidities, COVID-19 testing and
result status. We also did not collect detailed information on medication dosages (beyond
glucocorticoids), which could possibly lead to misclassification. We also identified eligible participants
using diagnostic codes, when it is possible that this information may inaccurately identify patients.
Nonetheless, we required ≥2 codes for a specific disease/condition from providers in specific specialty
departments to reduce potential misclassification. Results are also derived from individuals who
responded to our initial survey invitation and may not apply to the larger group of patients; responders

were more likely to be white and have higher SES, so it’s possible our results have underestimated the
impact of the pandemic in vulnerable groups. Lastly, as for any observational study, the potential for
unmeasured confounding cannot be eliminated.

Conclusion
Our findings are in line with existing research studies suggesting that exposure risks are strong riskfactors for contracting COVID-19. Other risk factors include a high comorbidity burden or a previous
exposure to glucocorticoids. Disruption to healthcare and important related services were common, and
non-universally distributed across patients. Those with pandemic-related changes to income (largely
those with lower SES) may be a particular vulnerable subgroup, but providers should be mindful of
potential delays of infusion therapies and disruption to care in general caused by COVID-19.
