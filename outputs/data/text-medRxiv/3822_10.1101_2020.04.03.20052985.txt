Abstract
Herewith we present a computational model for the forecasting of cumulative diagnosed cases of
Covid-19 pneumonia within a country. The only explicit parameter of the model is the population
density. The implicit parameter is a moving average ambient temperature, currently integrated into the
kinetic constants. Other finer details pertaining to the mechanism of the pathogen SARS-CoV-2
spread within a given region are implicitly manifested in the exponent parameters derived from the
non-linear fitting of the published data on Covid-19 occurrence. The performance of the model is
demonstrated on a few selected countries, and on the Diamond Princess cruising ship outbreak. The
model might be used as an aiding tool for the policy makers regarding the decisions on the
containment measures and quarantine regime required.
Introduction
The recent spread of freshly emerged pneumonia viral pathogen SARS-CoV-2 originating in Hubei
province (China) has caused a great havoc across all regions of the world. First time in the civilization
history quarantine measures of different magnitude were implemented in almost all countries, and
passenger traffic ceased. The governmental reactions to the disease spread ranged. South-East Asia
countries were tending more to strict martial-law style restrictions. Some of the Northern Europe
governments were trying to promote “herd immunity” concept, where the vulnerable members of the
society (e.g. the elderly and immuno-compromised) were isolated, while the others were allowed to be
with no restrictions. Allegedly, this strategy was to eventually terminate the disease spread due to
most of the society would be immune.
The important result of all these diverse actions is that each country happened to be in a sufficient
isolation from the others, maintaining its specific climate and social conditions.
It is hardly possible to account for all miniscule factors contributing to the pathogen spread in each
case, so that one needs certain simplifications in order to be able to forecast the disease progression.
The following factors are drawing immediate attention:
1. The diagnosed cases appear to be able to reach a plateau, without spreading to all population
(as witnessed by the examples of China and Diamond Princess ship).
2. There is an indication that the disease spread is much slower in hotter climates and in certain
humidity levels. A clear example is India and most of Africa, where the cases are very low
compared to the population numbers. Indeed, recent studies have shown that the temperature
optimum for the SARS-CoV viruses stability in the environment is around 4°C, yet the
humidity also have significant impact [1, 2].
3. A relatively lengthy incubation period (5–14 days [3]) combined with about tenfold rate of
undiagnosed cases [4] compared to the reported ones signals that the virus is struggling
reproducing in humans. In other terms, it is fast to spread, but not thermodynamically stable

These observations fit well into a range of processes, which could be described by the kinetics
of an autocatalytic chemical reaction. The corresponding model and its outcomes is presented
below.
Model
The data for the model were obtained from a daily updated resource at European Centre for Disease
Prevention and Control (https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-todays-datageographic-distribution-covid-19-cases-worldwide).
There was only one country so far, which has clearly demonstrated the total number of diagnosed
Covid-19 case to reach a plateau, China (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1. The dynamics of cumulative diagnosed cases in China, from 31/12/2019 to 26/03/2020.
Assuming that would be a general scenario other countries will follow, the starting points of the
model were derived from this case.
The S-shaped curve on Fig. 1 is typical for autocatalytic reactions, when the rate of the reaction is
accelerated by its product:

,
Where k1 is the rate constant in terms of standard chemical kinetics. Indeed, if we take the number of
healthy individuals for A, and the number of infected individuals for B, this reaction seems to be
suitable for epidemiological modelling. We need some infected people to infect the healthy ones, and
the more of sick people are around the faster it will happen:

The important note is that from this point on, the values of A and B will be expressed in units of
population density, that is the number of (un)healthy individuals divided by the country’s land area
(km2). The population density shall serve as a proxy for chemical concentration in standard kinetic
modelling.
In the simple case above the process will go uninterrupted until no more healthy people available. As
shown on Fig. 1, the infection has stopped at approximately 80,000 individuals, which is a tiny
fraction of China’s 1.4 billion population. When such phenomena are observed in chemical processes,
this is an indication of an existing equilibrium between the forward and reverse reaction, the latter
proceeding with a separate rate constant k2:

(2)
We have attempted first to fit the observed Covid-19 dynamics in China using equation (2), but the
results were not satisfactory.
The next step was to test a general case of the equilibrium above by introducing “stoichiometric
coefficients”1 a1, b1, b2:

Then the rate is expressed as following:

(3)
Since the total number of healthy and sick individuals equals to the country population, A + B equals
the population density, which is constant for a given country, dP = total population/land area. Then we
obtain the final expression for the infection rate:
(4)
The parameters k1, k2 are the “reaction rate constants”, specific for each country. They potentially
allow one to account for the effect of temperature on the disease spread using the Arrhenius equation:

(5)
Which for the epidemiology purposes could be simplified to

We are using quotation marks since the modelling is done by analogy with chemical equilibrium; in the
context of pathogen transmission these coefficients shall have a different meaning.

Where A and c are some constants specific for the region.
The tree exponents shall incorporate implicitly the specifics of the mechanisms of transmission
pertaining to the country, such as:
•

Government (un)action (e.g. introduction of quarantine, or “herd immunity”, or else…)

•

Local habits and traditions (e.g. wearing masks, mass gathering);

•

Local diet (e.g. turmeric-rich diet in India or fast food preferences);

•

Local prevailing genotype.

To obtain the model parameters, a subset of published data on each country was used, beginning from
some day when the country infection becomes evident (i.e. when the total numbers are still low, but
the new cases are reported every day). The experimental rate (day-1) dB/dt is equal then to the number
of reported new cases divided by the country area. The simulated rate will be the one calculated from
eq. (4) using a test set of the five model parameters (a1, b1, b2, k1, k2). The final set of parameters was

obtained by minimizing the sum of mean square deviations: ∑ (𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡𝑒𝑑 − 𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑐𝑢𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑑 ) for
the specified data range.
Results
We have finished simulations on ten countries and Diamond Princess liner. Regrettably only China,
the liner, and probably South Korea could be used to demonstrate the performance of the model.
Other countries were modelled blindly, so that these instances could be proven right or wrong only as
the disease propagates. Nevertheless, below we are presenting current results, with some critical
remarks.
1. China
This is the only country which is allegedly about to complete the infection cycle, with 81620 total
diagnosed cases and 1727 remaining active cases (as of April 03, 2020). Therefore it has been the
main testing ground for the model. Below we present four modelling outcomes, which differ only in
the selection of the data set (red dots on the graphs). Brown dots are the cumulative reported cases,
which were not included in the model; blue dashed line is the model’s forecast based on the start day.

As expected, a kinetic system based on a non-linear equation (eq. 4) is quite sensitive to the data
selection, and currently there is no universal criteria of how this selection should be done. Some
insights on that are given at the end of the manuscript.
However, the main uncertainty of the model is in the plateau height; the bend dates appear to be
congruent. Currently “the bend” is defined simply as the date when 85% of the calculated plateau
cases reached.
Surprisingly, when only half of the data is used (Fig. 3) the fit was much better on one occasion. This
would represent a real-life application of the model, and demonstrates its robustness on the
incomplete data sets.

2. Diamond Princess cruise ship
Diamond Princess is a cruise ship, which was bound to quarantine in the port of Yokohama, Japan on
5 February 2020 after a passenger has been diagnosed with Covid-19. The epidemiology of the virus
outbreak there was well studied in recent publications [5, 6].
Diamond Princess had carried total of 3711 people, which translates into a very high local population
density of ~26500 persons/km2. This is roughly 3 times higher than the most populous country,
Singapore, and, apparently this has resulted in a steep infection rate. Nevertheless, by the time
disembarkation on March 1st 2020, only approximately 20% of people onboard were tested positive
for SARS-CoV-2.
Despite a very unusual environment, the model handled this case perfectly well. Most datasets were
producing a forecast exactly reproducing the reported dynamics (Fig. 4, top).
In one particular curious case, if just one extra day was omitted from the model, it predicted a sharp
rise in the infection rates, up to 97% of the total passengers (Fig. 4, bottom). We prefer to think of this
scenario as an artefact of a non-linear system subjected to unnatural conditions (high population
density), but it also highlights the theoretically possible outcomes.

3. South Korea
South Korea is another interesting case, with a kink in the S-curve. The model was not able to
reproduce this kink, but it was consistent in predicting ~10000 of total cases, flattening at the end of
March 2020 (Fig. 5).

Fig. 5. The model for South Korea days 47-92.
It appears that the models might behave quite unpredictably depending on the selection of the start
day in the flat initial region, when the fluctuation in the rates is high. Therefore, one has to run the
simulation for a range of start dates (say, from the very beginning to the visible bend in the S-curve),
and then derive the conclusion based on the most frequent scenarios. As it is demonstrated below,
some countries are more stable than other.

4. Congruent countries: New Zealand, Italy, Spain
Apparently, for certain countries, which have advanced well up on their S-curve, the model produces
stable solutions. The solutions have certain spread in maximal cases and in the bend date, but this
spread could be considered acceptable.
New Zealand: the results are very reproducible, with the maximal cumulative cases ranging from 962
to 1271, and mean date for flattening of 05/04/2020 (Fig. 6).
The same for Italy, with maximal cases predicted from 158,000 to 169,000, and with mean flattening
date of 08/04/2020 (Fig. 7).
Spain: 197,000–231,000 total cases; flattening around 14/04/2020 (Fig. 8). Italy and Spain have the
same vertical scale for easy comparison, since these two countries had a similar dynamics of Covid19 spread.

5. Chaotic countries: Singapore, Sweden, India, USA
For the countries, which appear to be in the very beginning (flat portion) of their S-curves, the
model demonstrates a very unstable behaviour. For example, for India it predicts the total number
of cases anywhere from 13,000 to almost the whole population (Fig. 9). The countries in this
category are very diverse in terms of climate, governmental practices, and societal norms. So, for
the time being the possible solution would be to wait until the number of cases in each such
country yields a convergent forecast. The good news is that for each of the chaotic scenarios, the
bending point is in not-so-distant future (for India it ranges from the beginning of June to middle
of October 2020).
Fig. 10–12 show similar pattern for Singapore, Sweden, and the USA.

The possibility to detect the transformation of a country’s regime from chaotic to stable is
demonstrated below (Fig. 13) using the example of Italy. In the very beginning, the forecasts were
completely random until enough data was accumulated. At the end (95 days of data), the model is
quite consistent (Fig. 7).
This behaviour of the model makes it unusable for the forecast of the infection progression in the
countries with low reported cases (notably, most of African countries)
Conclusions
The presented model for Covid-19 progression has demonstrated good performance on the finished
cases (China and Diamond Princess liner). It appears that it is capable to detect the countries, which
are well advanced on the S-curve, and close to the plateau. For these countries the model produces
stable solutions regardless of the starting conditions. If the solutions demonstrate chaotic behaviour, it
might be an indicator that the country is in the very beginning of its local epidemy. General
recommendation in this case would be to rebuild the model periodically, as the new cases are
reported, until the forecast curves are converged with an acceptable spread.
