Abstract
A growing body of evidence indicates sex differences in the clinical outcomes of coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19)1-4. However, whether immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 differ
between sexes, and whether such differences explain male susceptibility to COVID-19, is
currently unknown. In this study, we examined sex differences in viral loads, SARS-CoV-2specific antibody titers, plasma cytokines, as well as blood cell phenotyping in COVID-19
patients. By focusing our analysis on patients with mild to moderate disease who had not
received immunomodulatory medications, our results revealed that male patients had higher
plasma levels of innate immune cytokines and chemokines including IL-8, IL-18, and CCL5,
along with more robust induction of non-classical monocytes. In contrast, female patients
mounted significantly more robust T cell activation than male patients during SARS-CoV-2
infection, which was sustained in old age. Importantly, we found that a poor T cell response
negatively correlated with patients’ age and was predictive of worse disease outcome in male
patients, but not in female patients. Conversely, higher innate immune cytokines in female
patients associated with worse disease progression, but not in male patients. These findings
reveal a possible explanation underlying observed sex biases in COVID-19, and provide
important basis for the development of sex-based approach to the treatment and care of men
and women with COVID-19.

Main
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the novel
coronavirus first detected in Wuhan, China, in November 2019, that causes coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19)5. On March 11th 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a
pandemic, and as of June 4th, cases are over 6.5 million globally, with more than 380,000
deaths attributed to the virus6. A growing body of evidence reveals that male sex is a risk factor
for a more severe disease, including death. Indeed, globally, ~60% of deaths from COVID-19
are reported in men7,8, and a recent cohort study of 17 million adults in England reported a
strong correlation between male sex and risk of death from COVID-19 (hazard ratio 1.99, 95%
confidence interval 1.88-2.10)8.
Past studies have demonstrated that sex has a significant impact on the outcome of
infections and has been associated with underlying differences in immune response to
infection9,10. For example, epidemiological data indicate that prevalence of hepatitis A and
tuberculosis are significantly higher in men compared with women11. Also, viral loads are
consistently higher in male patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV)12,13. Conversely, women mount a more robust immune response to vaccines14.
These findings collectively suggest a more robust ability among women to control infectious
agents. However, the mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 causes more severe disease in male
patients than in female patients remains unknown.
To elucidate the differential immune response against SARS-CoV-2 infection in men and
women, we performed detailed analysis on the sex differences in immune phenotype via the
assessment of viral loads, SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody levels, plasma cytokines/chemokines,
and blood cell phenotypes.
Overview of the study design
Patients who were admitted to the Yale-New Haven Hospital between March 18th and
May 9th, 2020 and were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal and/or
oropharyngeal swabs were enrolled through the IMPACT biorepository study. Among total 198
patients enrolled in IMPACT study this period, we obtained freshly-isolated peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs), plasma, nasopharyngeal swabs or saliva samples from in total 93
patients for the present study. The detailed demographics and clinical characteristics of study
participants are shown in Extended Data Table 1.
Nasopharyngeal swabs and saliva samples for virus RNA assessment along with blood
samples were collected on the day of enrollment. Plasma and PBMCs were isolated from whole

blood and plasma was used for titer measurements of SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 protein specific
IgG and IgM antibodies (anti-S1 IgG and IgM) and cytokine/chemokine measurements. Freshly
isolated PBMCs were stained and analyzed by flow cytometry analyses. A subset (n = 54) of
study participants donated blood, nasopharyngeal swabs, and saliva longitudinally (information
found in Extended Data Table 1). To compare the immune phenotype between sexes, two sets
of data analyses were performed in parallel, baseline and longitudinal. As a control group,
COVID-19 uninfected health care workers (HCWs) from Yale-New Haven Hospital were
enrolled. Demographics and background information for the HCW group are found in Extended
Data Table 1 and the demographics of HCWs for cytokine assays and flow cytometry assays for
the primary analyses (main figures) are found in Extended Data Table 2.
Baseline Analysis
The baseline analysis was performed on samples from the first time point of patients
who met the following criteria: not in intensive care unit (ICU), had not received tocilizumab
(Toci), and had not received high dose corticosteroids (CS; prednisone equivalent > 40 mg)
prior to the first sample collection date. This patient group, Cohort A, consisted of 39 patients
(17 men and 22 women). Patients on hydroxychloroquine and remdesivir were not excluded,
and 29 and 3 patients were on these drugs at the first time point sample collection, respectively.
The demographics and background clinical information of each patient are found in Extended
Data Table 2 and 3, respectively. The main figures represent analyses of baseline values
obtained from patients in Cohort A.
Longitudinal Analysis
As a parallel secondary analysis, we performed longitudinal analysis on a total patient
cohort (Cohort B). Cohort B included all patient samples from Cohort A (including multiple time
point samples from the Cohort A patients) as well as additional 54 patients who did not meet the
inclusion criteria for Cohort A. Pregnant patients, patients on active/recent chemotherapy for
cancers, patients with metastatic cancers, patients who have had renal transplant, and patients
with autoimmune/inflammatory diseases were not included. This analysis included multiple time
point samples from 93 participants in total. Data from Cohort B were analyzed for sex
differences in immune responses among patients using longitudinal multivariable analyses to
control for age, treatment (Toci and CS), days from symptom onset and ICU status. Both
adjusted least square means difference over time in immune response between male and
female COVID-19 patients (Extended Data Tables 4) and adjusted least square means

difference over time in immune response between male and female COVID-19 patients and
male and female healthcare workers (Extended Data Tables 5) were performed.
For both baseline analysis and longitudinal analysis, types of samples available from
each patient were variable, and information on the sample size (n) for each assay is shown in
the respective figure legends or tables. For Cohort A, sample types obtained from each patient
at the first time point can be found in Extended Data Table 3.
Male patients have higher levels of key innate immune cytokines
We first compared the virus RNA concentrations of male and female patients. For Cohort
A, the median concentrations of virus RNA assayed with nasopharyngeal swabs and saliva
were both higher in males, but there was no significant difference by sex. Analysis of the viral
load from Cohort B did not reveal a difference, either, although median virus RNA
concentrations both in nasopharyngeal swab and saliva samples were again higher in males
(Extended Data Table 4).
We found induction of anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein specific IgG and IgM (anti-S1-IgG
and –IgM) antibodies in the plasma of many patients, and IgG levels tended to be higher in
female patients, though not significantly different from their male counterpart (Fig. 1b). In the
analysis of Cohort B, the difference between sexes were not obvious (Extended Data Table 4
and 5). Thus, at baseline and during disease course, there are no clear differences in the
amount of IgG or IgM generated against the S protein between male and female.
Next, we analyzed the levels of 71 cytokines and chemokines in the plasma. It has been
previously reported that levels of many pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and growth
factors, including IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, TNF, CCL2, CXCL10, CCL3, G-CSF and GM-CSF, are
elevated in the plasma of COVID-19 patients reflecting innate immune activation15, but no
studies have thus far analyzed sex differences in cytokine and chemokine levels. In line with
previous reports, inflammatory cytokine/chemokine levels were generally higher in patients
compared with controls (Fig. 1c). Type-I/II/III interferon (IFN) levels were comparable between
sexes in Cohort A (Extended Data Fig. 1). However, we found significantly higher IFNα2 levels
in female patients than male patients in Cohort B (Extended Data Table 4 and 5). Levels of
many cytokines and chemokines, such as IL-6, CXCL10 (IP-10), CCL5 (RANTES), CCL8, were
upregulated in both men and women and the levels between sexes were comparable (Fig. 1d
and Extended Data Fig. 1 and 2). However, IL-8 was significantly higher in male patients

compared to female patients, and IL-18 was elevated in male patients compared to female
patients, albeit not significantly (Fig. 1d). In Cohort B, although we did not see significant sex
differences in IL-8 and IL-18, we found significantly higher levels of CCL5 in male patients
(Extended Data Table 4). CXCL10 levels were also higher in male patients, albeit not
significantly (differences-in-differences, Extended Data Table 5). These data indicated that
innate inflammatory cytokines and chemokines are more robustly elevated early and throughout
disease course in male patients over female patients.
Phenotypic differences in monocytes between male and female COVID-19 patients
Next, we examined the immune cell phenotype by flow cytometry. Freshly isolated
PBMCs were stained with specific antibodies to identify T cells, B cells, NK-T cells, NK cells,
monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells (Fig. 2a). As previously reported16, T cells were
significantly reduced in patients, but the levels were comparable between sexes (Fig. 2a,b),
while the proportion of B cells was increased in the patients to levels comparable between
sexes (Fig. 2a,b). Notably, we found an increase in total monocyte population in both sexes
(Fig. 2a). While CD14+CD16− classical monocytes (cMono) were comparable across all groups,
levels of CD14+CD16+ intermediate monocytes (intMono) were elevated in patients compared
with HCWs, and this elevation was more robust in female patients (Fig. 2c,d). In contrast, male
patients had higher levels of CD14loCD16+ non-classical monocytes (ncMono) compared to both
controls and female patients (Fig. 2c,d). In cohort B, we also observed higher levels of ncMonos
in male patients compared to controls, but no significant difference between sexes (Extended
Data Table 5). Since IL-8 (Cohort A) and CCL5 (Cohort B) levels were significantly higher in
male patients than in female patients, we examined this elevation was associated with elevation
of ncMono in male patients. There was no significant correlation in either sexes of IL-8 (data not
shown). However, we found a significant correlation between CCL5 levels and abundance in
ncMono only in male patients (Fig. 2e). These findings suggested that progression from
classical to non-classical monocytes is arrested at the intermediate stage in female patients,
and indicated that elevated innate inflammatory cytokines and chemokines are associated with
more robust activation of innate immune cells in male patients.
Female COVID-19 patients induce more robust T cell response than male patients
We further examined T cell phenotype in COVID-19 patients. The composition of overall CD4positive cells and CD8-positive cells among T cells were similar between all groups (Fig. 3a, b).

Detailed phenotyping of T cells for naïve T cells, central/effector memory T cells (Tcm/Tem),
follicular T cells (Tfh), regulatory T cells (Treg) revealed no remarkable differences in the
frequency of these subsets between sexes (Fig. 3a). However, we observed more robust
induction of CD38 and HLA-DR-positive activated T cells in female patients compared to male
patients (Fig. 3a,c,d). In parallel, PD-1 and TIM-3-positive terminally differentiated T cells were
more robustly induced in female patients compared to male patients (Fig. 3a,e,f). These findings
were seen both in CD4 and CD8 T cells, but the differences were more exaggerated in CD8 T
cells (Fig. 3d, f). We also stained for intracellular cytokines in T cells such as IFNγ, Granzyme B
(GzB), TNF, IL-6, and IL-2 for CD8 T cells, and IFNγ, TNF, IL-17A, IL-6, and IL-2 for CD4 T
cells. Levels of these cytokines were higher in patients compared to controls, and were
generally comparable between sexes in the patients (Fig. 3g). Analyses of T cell phenotype in
Cohort B did not reveal significant differences between sexes (Extended Data Table 4, 5). Thus,
female COVID-19 patients had more abundant activated and terminally differentiated T cell
population than male patients at baseline.
Sex-differences in immune phenotype associated with worsening of COVID-19 disease
Finally, we investigated if certain immune phenotypes and their related factors could be
predictive of the severity of the disease, and whether these phenotypes and factors could be
different between sexes. To this end, we evaluated the trajectory of the clinical scores of each
patient in Cohort A. We then divided the patients in two groups, stabilized group and
deteriorated group. The patient was categorized into the deteriorated group if the patient
marked a worse, or higher, clinical score at any point compared to the patient’s initial clinical
score (see Extended Data Table 3. Cmax > C1), and were otherwise categorized as stabilized.
We first examined the demographics of the 4 groups, namely, stabilized male patients
(M_stabilized), deteriorated male patients (M_deteriorated), stabilized female patients
(F_stabilized), and deteriorated female patients (F_deteriorated), and found that while
M_deteriorated group were significantly older compared with M_stabilized group, the two female
groups were comparable in age (Fig. 4a). In addition, body mass index (BMI) for M_deteriorated
was higher in the M_stabilized group, while there was no difference between F_deteriorated and
F_stabilized groups (Fig. 4a). In contrast, F_stabilized group had lower median values for virus
RNA concentrations compared to F_deteriorated group or with two male groups, particularly in
saliva (Fig. 4a). We observed higher anti-S IgG levels in the women who had stable disease
compared to women with progressive disease, the latter being comparable to men with stable

disease or worse disease (Fig. 4a). Thus, the robust anti-S IgG levels in women was associated
with their ability to control disease progression.
We further investigated if the key factors identified in the previous analyses correlate
with disease progression in male and female patients. We observed that regardless of sex,
some chemokines and growth factors, such as CXCL10 (IP-10) and M-CSF, were elevated in
patients that went on to develop worse disease. However, there were some key innate immune
cytokines, such as CCL5, TNFSF10 (TRAIL) and IL-15, which were specifically elevated only in
female patients that subsequently progressed to worse disease, but this difference was not
observed in male patients (Fig. 4b). In the age-adjusted analysis of Cohort A, we also found that
CXCL10 was only elevated in female patients that progressed to worse disease compared to
stabilized patients, but no such correlation as found in men (Extended Data Table 6).
T cell phenotypes in these groups revealed that male patients whose disease worsened had a
significantly lower proportion of activated T cell population (CD38+HLA-DR+), and tendencies for
fewer terminally differentiated T cell population (PD-1+TIM-3+) and IFNγ+ CD8 T cells at the first
sample collection, compared with their counterpart men who progressed to worse disease (Fig.
4c). However, in women, the deteriorated group had similar levels of these types of CD8 T cells
compared with the stabilized group (Fig. 4c).
We finally examined the correlations between age, BMI, viral loads, anti-S1 antibodies,
cytokines/chemokines, activated/terminally differentiated/IFNγ-producing CD8 T cells, and
clinical disease course (Cmax – C1 was used for the deterioration score). The correlation matrix
clearly revealed that in women, higher innate immune cytokines such as TNFSF10 and IL-15
were positively correlated with disease progression, while there was no association between
CD8 T cell status and deterioration (Fig. 4d, results of age-adjusted analysis in Extended Data
Table 6). In particular, CXCL10 and IL-15 were positively correlated with IFNγ+CD8 T cells in
female patients (Fig. 4d). Additionally, CXCL10 was negatively correlated with anti-S IgG levels
in female patients but not in male patients.
In contrast, in male patients, progressive disease was clearly associated with higher
age, higher BMI, and poor CD8 T cell activation (Fig. 4d). Poor CD8 T cell activation and poor
IFNγ production by CD8 T cells were significantly correlated with patients’ age, while these
correlations were not seen in female patients (Fig. 4d,e). These differences seemed to highlight

Discussion
Our results revealed key differences in immune responses during the early phase of
SARS-CoV-2 infection in male and female patients. First, we found that the levels of several
important proinflammatory innate immune cytokines such as IL-8 and CCL5 were higher in male
patients, which correlated with the robust increase in non-classical monocytes. Second, T cell
responses were more robustly activated in female patients compared to male patients. In
particular, activated CD8 T cells were significantly elevated only in female patients but not in
male patients over healthy volunteers. Analysis of their clinical trajectory revealed that, while
poor T cell responses were associated with future progression of disease in male patients,
higher innate immune cytokine levels were associated with worsening of COVID-19 disease in
female patients. Importantly, the T cell response was significantly and negatively correlated with
patients’ age in male, but not in female, patients. These data indicate key differences in the
baseline immune capabilities in men and women during the early phase of SARS-COV-2
infection, and suggest a potential immunological underpinning of the distinct mechanisms of
disease progression between sexes. These analyses also provide a potential basis for taking
sex-dependent approaches to prognosis, prevention, care, and therapy for patient with COVID19.
Most patients with severe COVID-19 exhibit substantially elevated plasma levels of proinflammatory cytokines including IL-6 and IL-1β, as well as IL-2, IL-8, IL-17, G-CSF, GM-CSF,
CXCL10, CCL2, CCL3 and TNF, characterized as cytokine storm15,17. Activation of these
cytokines may lead to shock and tissue damage and subsequently to multiple organ failure.
They also mediate extensive pulmonary pathology, typically presenting with massive infiltration
of neutrophils, leading to diffuse alveolar damage18. Certain clinical inflammation markers, such
as CRP and procalcitonin, which are known to correlate with IL-6 and IL-8 levels, are higher in
men in severe cases of COVID-19 (Ref. 4). In the present study, we found the higher levels of
several cytokines, IL-8, IL-18 (Cohort A), and CCL5 (Cohort B), in the plasma of male patients
compared to female patients. A recently published study demonstrated that higher plasma
levels of IL-8 are significantly correlated with the decrease in lymphocytes, and lymphopenia
(especially the decrease in T cells) is predictive of COVID-19 disease progression16. IL-8 is a
key chemotactic factor for neutrophils19,20, and neutrophils are associated with poorer outcomes
in patients with COVID-19 (Ref.21). We found robust increase in ncMono in the male patients
compared with female patients, while female patients had elevated intMono. ncMono patrol the
endothelium in search of injury, and secrete inflammatory cytokines in response to infection,
activate endothelial cells, and support the secondary recruitment of neutrophils22,23.

In contrast to the higher levels of innate cytokines, we found poor T cell activation in
males with less induction of CD8 cells expressing CD38 and HLA-DR, two classical T cell
activation markers. Studies have shown that this population exhibits high effector functions,
such as proliferation, cytotoxicity, and cytokine production, and this subpopulation of activated
CD8+ T cells performs an important function during acute viral infections, contributing to viral
control24-27. In fact, in our cohort, the male patients who progressed in disease severity had
lower levels of CD38+HLA-DR+ CD8 T cells at the first collection. In male patients, loss of
activated T cells correlated with old age. In female patients, even older patients were able to
develop robust T cell responses. These findings are in line with numerous previous studies that
T cells in women are generally more robust compared to men in response to stimulation9, 28. The
basis of this difference has been at least partially attributed to the fact that many anti-viral genes
or inflammatory genes have estrogen response elements (EREs) in their promoter regions28.
And of particular importance, we found that activation as well as IFNγ expression of CD8 T cells
significantly decline along with age in male patients, while this correlation was not observed in
female patients. Age-associated CD8 T cell decrease and dysfunctions have been widely
studied and demonstrated29, and a recent study has reported the sexual-dimorphism in human
immune system aging, including the T cell numbers and phenotypes30. Thus, these results
collectively paint a picture that in male patients, aging results in T cell activation defects.
Elevated IL-8 levels correlate with lymphopenia16. Simultaneously, CCL5 levels were elevated in
male patients, potentially leading to the induction and recruitment of inflammatory monocytes to
the lung fueling further recruitment of neutrophils, and our finding on the correlation between
CCL5 and ncMono abundance is in consistent with this notion. Ultimately, T cell dysfunction
with age leads to worse COVID-19 disease outcome. In contrast, in female patients, aging does
not appear to lead to T cell dysfunction during COVID-19. Even older women generate robust T
cell immunity. However, in some women infected with SARS-CoV-2, they fail to regulate innate
immune activation, leading to higher levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which is
associated with worse disease outcome. Female patients that develop anti-S IgG during early
infection can suppress proinflammatory cytokines such as CXCL10 and do not progress to
worse disease.
Collectively, these data suggest that vaccines and therapies to elevate T cell immune
response to SARS-CoV-2 might be warranted for male patients, while female patients might
benefit from therapies that dampen innate immune activation early during disease. In summary,
our data collectively suggest that the immune landscape in COVID-19 patients is considerably

were collected at study enrollment (baseline) and every 3 to 4 days while in the hospital in 54 of
these 93 patients.
The patients were assessed with a locally developed clinical scoring system for disease
severity; 1: admitted and observed without supplemental oxygen, 2: required ≤ 3L supplemental
oxygen via nasal canal to maintain SpO2 > 92%, 3: received tocilizumab, which per hospital
treatment protocol required that the patient to require > 3L supplemental oxygen to maintain
SpO2 > 92%, or, required > 2L supplemental oxygen to maintain SpO2 > 92% and had a high
sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) > 70. 4: the patient required intensive care unit (ICU) level
care, 5: the patient required intubation and mechanical ventilation. Detailed demographic
information for the entire cohort (93 Cohort B patients, and multiple time point samples from 54
patients among them) and of Cohort A (39 patients) are shown in Extended Data Table 1-3.
Virus RNA measurement
SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations were measured from nasopharyngeal samples and saliva
samples by RT-PCR as previously described31,32. In short, total nucleic acid was extracted from
300 µl of viral transport media from the nasopharyngeal swab or 300 µl of whole saliva using the
MagMAX Viral/Pathogen Nucleic Acid Isolation kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) using a modified

protocol and eluted into 75 µl of elution buffer32. For SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection, 5 µl of RNA
template was tested as previously described31, using the US CDC real-time RT-PCR
primer/probe sets for 2019-nCoV_N1, 2019-nCoV_N2, and the human RNase P (RP) as an
extraction control. Virus RNA copies were quantified using a 10-fold dilution standard curve of
RNA transcripts that we previously generated31.
SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody titer measurement
ELISAs were performed as previously described33. In short, Triton X-100 and RNase A were
added to serum samples at final concentrations of 0.5 % and 0.5 mg/ml respectively and
incubated at room temperature (RT) for 30 minutes before use to reduce risk from any potential
virus in serum. 96-well MaxiSorp plates (Thermo Scientific #442404) were coated with 50 µl/well
of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein (ACROBiosystems #S1N-C52H3-100 µg) at a
concentration of 2 µg/ml in PBS and were incubated overnight at 4 °C. The coating buffer was
removed, and plates were incubated for 1 hour at RT with 200 µl of blocking solution (PBS with
0.1% Tween-20, 3% milk powder). Serum was diluted 1:50 in dilution solution (PBS with 0.1%
Tween-20, 1% milk powder) and 100 µl of diluted serum was added for two hours at RT. Plates
were washed three times with PBS-T (PBS with 0.1% Tween-20) and 50 µl of HRP anti-Human
IgG Antibody (GenScript #A00166, 1:5000) or anti-Human IgM-Peroxidase Antibody (SigmaAldrich #A6907, 1:5000) diluted in dilution solution were added to each well. After 1 hour of
incubation at RT, plates were washed six times with PBS-T. Plates were developed with 100 µl
of TMB Substrate Reagent Set (BD Biosciences #555214) and the reaction was stopped after
12 min by the addition of 100ul of 2 N sulfuric acid. Plates were then read at a wavelength of
450 nm and 570nm.
Isolation of plasma
Plasma samples were collected after whole blood centrifugation at 400 g for 10 minutes at RT
with brake off. The plasma was then carefully transferred to 15 ml conical tubes and then
aliquoted and stored at -80 °C for subsequent analysis.
Cytokine and chemokine measurement
Patients’ sera isolated as above were stored in -80 °C until the measurement of the cytokines.
The sera were shipped to Eve technologies (Calgary, Alberta, Canada) on dry ice, and levels of
71 cytokines and chemokines were measured with Human Cytokine Array/Chemokine Array 71Plex Panel (HD71). All the samples were measured upon the first thaw.

Isolation of PBMCs
The peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from heparinized whole blood
using Histopaque density gradient under the biosafety level 2+ facility. To isolate PBMCs, blood
1:1 diluted in PBS was layered over in Histopaque in a SepMate tube and centrifuged for 10
minutes at 1200g. The PBMC layer was collected by quickly pouring the content into a new
50ml tube. The cells were washed twice with PBS to remove any remaining histopaque and to
remove platelets. The pelleted cells were treated with ACK buffer for red cell lysis and then
counted. The percentage viability was estimated using Trypan blue staining.

10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin, X Sodium
Pyruvate, and X 2-Mercaptoethanol) and stored at 4°C overnight. Subsequently, these cells
were washed and stimulated with 1X Cell Stimulation Cocktail (eBioscience) in 200 μL cRPMI
for 1 hour at 37°C. Directly to this, 50 μL of 5X Stimulation Cocktail (plus protein transport
inhibitor) (eBioscience) was added for an additional 4 hours of incubation at 37°C. Following
stimulation, cells were washed and resuspended in 100 μL of 4% PFA for 30min at 4°C. To
quantify intracellular cytokines, these samples were permeabilized with 1X Permeabilization
Buffer from the FOXP3/ Transcription Factor Staining Buffer Set (eBioscience) for 10 minutes at
4°C. All further staining cocktails were made in this buffer. Permeabilized cells were then
washed and resuspended in a cocktail containing Human TruStan FcX (BioLegend) for 10
minutes at 4°C. Finally, intracellular staining cocktails were directly added to each sample for 1
hour at 4°C. Following this incubation, cells were washed and prepared for analysis on an
Attune NXT (ThermoFisher). Data were analysed using FlowJo software version 10.6 software
(Tree Star). Set of markers used to identify each subset of cells are summarized in Extended
Data Table 7.
Statistical analysis for the primary analyses
For the primary analyses shown in the main figures, Graph Pad Prism (v8.0) was used for all
statistical analysis. Otherwise noted, Bonferroni’s multiple comparison test was used for the
comparisons between M_Pt vs F_Pt, M_Pt vs M_HCW, F_Pt vs F_HCW, and M_HCW vs
F_HCW for the comparisons. For the comparison between stabilized group and deteriolated
group in each sex (Fig. 4 a-c), two-sided unpaired t-test was used for the comparison.
Bioconductor R software was used to generate heatmaps (Fig. 1c, 2a, 3a, 3g), XY graphs for
correlation analyses (Fig. 2e and 4e), and Pearson correlation plots (Fig. 4d). For the generation
of all heatmaps, log-transformed values were used. For ELISA analysis with Cohort A and HCW
samples (n = 82, M_HCW : F_HCW : M_Pt : F_Pt = 15 : 29 : 17 : 21), due to the presence of
extreme outliers, the top and bottom 1-percentile values were cut off as the outliers for each
cytokine/chemokine, and the remaining values were used for the analyses.
Statistical analysis for the secondary analyses
All multivariate analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.4 (Cary, NC). We conducted
longitudinal analyses of the differences in immune response by sex for patients with COVID-19
and differences in immune response between patients with COVID-19 and healthcare workers
by sex and adjusted linear regression to evaluate differences in immune response by sex and

patient trajectory.
Difference in immune response in COVID-19 positive patients by sex
A marginal linear model was fit to evaluate the difference in various immune responses
(outcome) in patients by sex (exposure). We used an auto-regressive correlation structure to
account for correlation between repeat observations in an individual over time. To account for
the small sample size and unequal follow-up between participants, we used the Morel-BokossaNeerchal (MBN) correction. Propensity score methods for covariate adjustment were used to
control for the following covariates: age (in years), days since symptom onset (self-reported),
ICU status (as a proxy for disease severity) and treatment with either tocilizumab or
corticosteroids. A patient was defined as ‘on tocilizumab’ at a given time point if they had
received the treatment within fourteen days prior to the time the sample was taken. Patients
were defined as ‘on corticosteroids’ if they had received the treatment on the same day the
sample was taken. The resulting regression coefficients were interpreted as the difference in
immune response between female and male patients.
Difference in immune response between COVID-19 positive patients and healthcare workers by
sex
To compare differences in immune response between patients and healthcare workers,
marginal linear model with a compound symmetric correlation structure and the MBN correction
was used to evaluate the difference in immune response between patients and healthcare
workers by sex. The model contained terms for sex, study group (patient versus healthcare
worker), age (in years) and an interaction term between sex and study group. We calculated the
least square means for each group (female patients, female healthcare workers, male patient,
male healthcare workers) and evaluated the differences in least square means to compare
study groups by sex (female patients vs. female healthcare workers and male patients vs. male
healthcare workers). Lastly, the regression coefficient of the interaction term between sex and
study group was interpreted as the difference-in-differences between the two groups by sex.
Multivariate patient trajectory analysis
We used linear regression to evaluate the difference in baseline immune response between
patients who worsened after the baseline sample was taken and those who stabilized by sex.
The model contained terms for sex, patient trajectory (worsened vs. stable), age and an
interaction term for sex and patient trajectory. We calculated the least square means for each

group (female patients who worsened, female patients who stabilized, male patients who
worsened and male patients who stabilized) and evaluated the differences in least square
means of patient trajectory by sex using the Tukey correction for multiple comparisons. The
regression coefficient of the interaction term between sex and patient trajectory was interpreted
as the difference-in-differences between the two patient trajectories by sex.

Fig. 4 Differential immune phenotypes related to COVID-19 disease progression between sexes.
Patients in Cohort A are divided into stabilized group and deteriorated group, depending on the comparison
between maximum clinical score after sampling and the score at the sampling (M_stablized ; M_deteriorated
: F_stablized : F_aggravated= 11:6:16:6). a, The differences in the patients’ age, BMI, nasopharyngeal/saliva
virus RNA copies, and anti-S1-IgG antibody are compared. For virus concentration panels, dotted lines
indicate the detection limit, and median values are indicated for each group. b, Cytokine/chemokine comparison between stabilized and deteriorated group. c, Proportions of activated (CD38+HLA-DR+) and terminally
differentiated (PD-1+TIM-3+) CD4/CD8 T cells, and IFNγ+CD8 T cells in CD3-positive T cells are shown. d,
Pearson correlation heatmaps of the indicated parameters are shown for each sex. For viral load levels and
cytokine/chemokine levels, log-transformed values were used for the calculation of the correlations. The size
and color of the circles indicate the correlation coefficient (R), and only statistically significant correlations (p
< 0.05) are shown. Clinical deterioration from the first time point is scored by Cmax- C1. e, Correlation between
age and CD38+HLA-DR+ CD8 T cells (left) and IFNγ+CD8 T cells (right, both in % of CD3 T cells). Linear
regression lines and 95% confidence intervals are shown. Pearson correlation coefficient (R) and p-values
for each correlation and for each sex are shown on top of each plot. Data are mean ± SEM and unpaired
t-test was used to compare the differences between stabilized group and deteriorated group about each sex
in a, b, c. For the age panel in a and correlation plots for age and T cells (e), data points for individuals ≥
90-year-old are plotted as 90-year-old. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01. All p-values < 0.10 are shown in the panels.
