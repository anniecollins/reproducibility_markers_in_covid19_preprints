Abstract
Background: Guduchi Ghan Vati (aqueous extract of Tinospora cordifolia) is an essential
herbal plant in Indian traditional medicine (Ayurveda) that is well documented as an
immunomodulator and antimicrobial agent. A recent in silico study found the therapeutic
efficacy of Guduchi against SARS-CoV-2. Based on available evidence, we conducted a
feasibility study of the safety and efficacy of Guduchi Ghan Vati in asymptomatic
patients with covid-19.

Patients and methods: An open label, feasibility trial was conducted on 46 patients in the
hospital setting. A single-arm study with no control group and blinding was executed in
Jodhpur, Rajasthan, India. All patients orally received 2 tablets (1000 mg) twice daily for 2
weeks. Clinical parameters were collected at baseline, day 3, day 7 and day 14. Patients were
continuously monitored for side effects and adverse reactions during the study period. .

Results: Out of 46 asymptomatic patients included in the study, 40 completed the 14-day
follow-up period. None developed any Covid-19 symptoms after admission to the hospital.
On day 3 post-treatment, viral clearance was reported in 16 (32.5%) patients. By the end of
D-7, 38 (95%) patients had viral load disappearance. Follow-up at D-14 showed that all
participants tested negative.

Conclusion: In adult patients with asymptomatic Covid-19, Gudhuchi Ghan Vati could be
effective. Randomized controlled trials with larger sample sizes in patients with Covid-19 are
urgently needed to confirm the definite benefit with Ayurveda.

Keywords: Ayurveda, Guduchi Ghan Vati, Asymptomatic Covid-19

Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a constantly evolving
threat with over 25.8 million active cases and over 859 K deaths worldwide.1 Almost 80% of
Covid-19 confirmed patients suffer from mild to moderate symptoms and recover on their
own. Among these large proportion of low-risk Covid-19 cases, asymptomatic patients are
merging higher. Asymptomatic patients appear with no clinical symptoms but are
contagious.2

The emergence of asymptomatic patients poses a significant challenge to the prevention and
treatment of the epidemic. Most clinical drugs and supportive therapies are focused on severe
patients, whereas treatment options for asymptomatic to mild symptoms remain unclear.
Asymptomatic to symptomatic cases may evolve to the most severe disease form without
treatment indications. Standard guidelines suggest isolation for asymptomatic cases to control
the spread of virus.3 There have not been any treatment options that reduce the viral load or
preventive options that reduce the risk of developing severe conditions.
Various medicinal plants in Ayurveda (Indian Traditional Medicine)4 have been valued as
immunomodulators,5,6 antiviral7,8 and antimicrobials.9-12 These properties have been
scientifically investigated previously with promising results. Among them, Tinospora
Cordifolia (Guduchi/ Giloy),13 is a unique Ayurvedic classical preparation called Guduchi
Ghav Vati. With its pharmacological functions and medicinal values described, applications
of Guduchi in countering various disorders are very common. Its usage as an
immunomodulator,14,15 antioxidant,16 anti-microbial17 and anti-cancer properties,18,19 made it
an interesting focus for Covid-19 management. Recently, an in silico pharmacology study20
showed the feasible efficacy of Guduchi against coronavirus in general and SARS-CoV2 specifically. The reported efficacy of favipiravir, lopinavir/ritonavir and remdesivir
was found to be either similar or inferior to the natural component from Guduchi. A
previous retrospective study21 also found that Guduchi Ghan Vati was effective in viral
clearance and reducing hospital stay compared to standard care.

Therefore, based on the available preliminary evidence, the first prospective feasibility study
was undertaken. We aimed to investigate the safety of Guduchi Ghan Vati in asymptomatic
patients with Covid-19 and to establish an initial impression of its efficacy.

Methods:
In urgent response to the accelerating outbreak of Covid-19 in India, the present study was
conducted at Covid Care Centre, Jodhpur, Rajasthan, India, as a nonrandomized, single arm
trial. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board, who independently
reviewed the safety of the drug administered. The study complied with the Good Clinical
Practice guidelines, Declaration of Helsinki, and Research regulatory requirements of Indian
Council of Medical Research along with AYUSH recommended guidelines for patient care
with Ayurveda.
Under the principal investigator (AK), the team of investigators (GP, SS, VG) was mainly
responsible for designing, initiating and managing trials with the local Jodhpur Covid-19 care
center in Rajasthan, India. Aarogyam (UK) as a collaborative technical partner assisted in the
study compilation, data management and statistical analyses. Data were recorded by
physicians mainly responsible for patient care in hospitals. The research assistant then
entered confirmed data, masking the patient identifications and any contact details, into the
Medcalc statistical software database for statistical analyses.
Independent of the study team, the Data & Safety Monitoring Board was established, which
monitored the progress of the study and reviewed the safety and efficacy data while the trial
was ongoing. Committee members represented multidisciplinary experts, including Covid
Care physicians, Ayurveda Physicians, and Biostatistician. The committee agreed to share the
report of the trial as a priority to support better clinical management of Covid-19 and
facilitate future trials.
Patients
This study enrolled 46 patients who were admitted between May 1, 2020 and May 31, 2020
in the government of Rajasthan designated the Covid-19 treatment centre. There was no
placebo used, and the drug was not masked.
All hospitalized cases above 18 years of age, diagnosed with Covid-19 and who are
asymptomatic at the time of admission were included in the study. Patients were excluded if
they had severe vomiting that would affect oral administration of medicine difficult,
respiratory failure or requiring mechanical ventilation, patients having alanine transaminase
(ALT) or aspartate transaminase (AST) > 5 times the upper range of normal limits, patients
with Covid-19 in critical condition or ARDS or NIAD 8 –point ordinal score-2 (hospitalized,
on invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, combined

organ failure requiring ICU monitoring, patients with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, (HbA1c
more than 8.0), malignant, chronic renal failure or those on immunosuppressive medication.
Eligible patients were given study details and provided an information sheet on Ayurveda
medicine along with trial information. Written informed consent was obtained from each
participant. Participants were free to withdraw from the study willingly at any stage. All
patients were managed with WHO and ICMR clinical practice guidelines for Covid-19.
Teams of laboratory technicians who performed clinical measurements were unaware of
treatment information.
Intervention
Guduchi Ghana is a unique Ayuvedic classical preparation prepared from aqueous extracts
of Tinospora cordifolia stem. For the purpose of the present study, the Vai (tablet) form
was prepared in the Pharmacy, University College of Ayurveda, Jodhour, India following the
standard procedure. Guduchi Ghan Vati was orally administered 2 tablets (1000 mg) twice
daily for 2 weeks.
Outcome measures
The primary end point was virologic clearance at day 7 post-treatment. Secondary outcomes
were clinical follow-up (day 14) (body temperature, clinical symptoms, hospital stay and
complications) and the occurrence of any side effects. Outcome measures were collected at
baseline, day 3, day 7 and day 14. In addition to SARS-CoV-2 testing, patients were assessed
for vital signs and laboratory tests at hospital admission and follow-up at day 14. Records of
Guduchi administration, side effects and adverse events were reviewed daily to ensure patient
safety.
Statistical analysis and sample size calculation
This study was taken as a pilot study for asymptomatic patients only. Assuming a 50%
efficacy of Guduchi Ghan Vati in reducing the viral load at day 7, an 85% power, a type I
error rate of 5%, and 20% dropouts, we calculated that a total of 46 Covid-19 patients would
be required for the analysis (Fleiss with CC).
Statistical differences were evaluated by Pearson's chi-square or Fisher's exact tests as
categorical variables, as appropriate. Means of quantitative data were compared using
Student's t-test. Analyses were performed in MedCalc, version 15.0 (MedCalc Software,
Ostend, Belgium).

Results
Of 92 screened Covid-confirmed patients, 46 asymptomatic patients were included in the
study, and 40 completed the 14-day follow-up. The total dropout rate was 13.04%), and all 14
days of drug compliance was 100%. The median participant age was 31 years, and 80% were
male. None of the patients had pre-existing conditions. Table 1 describes the main clinical
characteristics at baseline. At admission, none of the patients had any symptoms or normal
vital and laboratory tests except an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. The interval from
the first day of positive nucleic acid tests to the first day of continuous negative tests was
4.82 mean days (in usual setting 14 to 21 days), and 38 (95%) had a negative test on D-7 who
were discharged from the hospital on day 9. Two patients had negative results on follow-up
D-14. (Table 2)

On the follow-up at D-14, lab tests were repeated, and compared to baseline, ESR levels were
reduced significantly (95% CI difference 8.499- 19.901; p<0.0001) and were within the
normal range along with the rest of the blood tests. There were no adverse events or side
effects reported. Ayurveda was safe to use in all study participants.
Discussion:
Taken together, the present study highlights the efficacy and safety of Guduchi Ghan Vati, an
Ayurvedic preparation, in the treatment of asymptomatic Covid-19. The results suggest a
promising role of Guduchi Ghan Vati in terms of virologic cure with no side effects. Notably,
young adults having no pre-existing medical condition might have influenced faster recovery.
However, comparing the median duration of viral shedding reported in the previous study
was 19 d (IQR, 15–26 d), whereas with Guduchi Ghan Vati, it was 5 d (IQR, 3-11 d).

Major limitations of the study should be considered. First, properly designed controlled trials
are urgently required to confirm the benefits of Ayurveda treatment. Second, without any preexisting symptoms or medical conditions, in the healthy asymptomatic Covid-19 confirmed
case, the role of Ayurveda intervention needs to be evaluated with caution.
Finally, background therapies, including support interventions previously taken by
participants, were not protocolled. Since the early outbreak, prophylactic support therapies
(herbal supplements, Ayurveda, Homeopathy) have been recommended by the Government
of India and are widely used by people.

In conclusion, in asymptomatic Covid-19 confirmed cases, Ayurveda intervention can be
considered a safe option. The results highlight the importance of curbing infection, which
could limit the transmission of the virus to other people to curb the spread of Covid-19.
