Abstract
In the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, currently vaccines and specific anti-viral treatment are not yet
available. Thus, preventing viral transmission by case isolation, quarantine, and social distancing is
essential to slowing its spread. Here we model social networks using weighted graphs, where vertices
represent individuals and edges represent contact. As public health measures are implemented,
connectivity in the graph decreases, resulting in lower effective reproductive numbers, and reduced viral
transmission. For COVID-19, model parameters were derived from the coronavirus epidemic in China,
validated by epidemic data in Italy, then applied to the United States. We calculate that, in the U.S., the
public is able to contain viral transmission by limiting the average number of contacts per person to less
than 7 unique individuals over each 5 day period. This increases the average social distance between
individuals to 10 degrees of separation.

Introduction
From December 31, 2019 to March 18, 2020, the COVID-19 (SARS-CoV2) coronavirus pandemic has
infected a reported 209,839 number of people, resulting in 8,778 deaths, in 168 countries around the
world, and continue to spread exponentially1. While the world awaits the development of vaccines and
anti-viral medications, traditional public health measures such as isolation of confirmed or suspected
cases, quarantine of contacts, and social distancing of the public are effective measures to reduce viral
transmission2, 3, that have been implemented in many regions and countries4, 5.
COVID-19 is a respiratory infection transmitted by aerosol, droplet, contact, and oral-fecal routes,
through networks of social contact. A social network can be visualized as a weighted graph, where
vertices represent individuals and edges represent the amount of contact6. In the U.S., for example, a
pair of individuals can be connected by an average of 6 acquaintances, commonly known as 6 degrees of
separation. This small world phenomenon directly affects the spread of COVID-19.
Conceptually, an epidemic is dependent on network connectivity and time7. As edges of contact are
removed, the average degree of each vertex declines, and connectivity falls. Practically, viral
transmission is attenuated by isolation, quarantine and social distancing8, 9, 10. These public health
measures decrease the number of close contacts, resulting in higher degrees of separation within the
public, thereby impeding transmission. This paper examines the level of public health measures needed
to contain the COVID-19 pandemic.

Model
In general, let graph g represent a weighted network of social contacts. Suppose that it contains n
vertices, V1 to Vn, representing n individuals. For a pair of connected vertices Vi and Vj, let eij be their
common edge with weight wij. If Vi has degree k, then it carries a weighted value of 𝑣𝑖 = ∑ 𝑤𝑖𝑗 , summed
over its k edges. Let k̅ be the average of degree of each vertex and d̅ be the average degree of
separation of g. Then, d̅ ≈ log n / log k̅.
We begin by modelling viral transmission on g. Suppose individual i is infected and had contact with k
other individuals. Let wij be the probability of disease transmission between individuals i and j. Then vi is
the reproductive number for individual i, that is, the average number of secondary infections stemming
from i. For instance, super-spreading occurs at densely connected vertices, while viral transmission is
likely to terminate at sparsely connected vertices.
In a dynamic network, where edges are added and removed, these parameters vary with time
corresponding to changes in social behavior. For example, case isolation decreases the degree of Vi,
while quarantine decreases the degree of vertices connected to Vi. Universal precautions such as
wearing masks reduces the probability of transmission, wij.

Baseline Assumptions
The following assumptions are based on literature review and expert opinion and represent the current
knowledge of COVID-19 epidemiology. The values of these parameters often differ by study.
The average generation interval of COVID-19 is about 5 days11, 12, 13. (Note that estimates of reproductive
numbers are proportional to the assumed generation time.) On average, it take patients 2 days after the
start of the infectious period, which can precede symptoms, to seek medical care or report illness14.
Among sick contacts, 80% are traced by public health and quarantined at home. When individuals
practice social distancing such as staying at home, contacts will spend more time with each other by a
factor of 1.5. For example, a person who usually spends 12 hours a day with family now spends 18 hours
with them. For cases isolated at home, routine precautions reduce household transmission by 50%.

Parameter Derivation
Using COVID-19 epidemic data from China, the initial epicenter of the outbreak, we will derive
parameters for the social network model. First, based on a population study of social mixing patterns in
China15, the mean number of contacts with unique individuals, over the generation time of COVID-19, is
36, population degree of separation 5.88. Then strict social distancing limits contacts to the household
setting and shopping for essential supplies, i.e., 6.3 unique individuals (3.3 in household and 3 in nonhousehold settings), degree of separation 11.5. (See supplementary materials.) Confirmed COVID-19
patients were hospitalized or admitted to isolation centers. Then using open-access daily case reports16,
we calculate the daily mean reproductive number of the COVID-19 epidemic (Figure 1).

Figure 1: Daily mean reproductive number (R) of COVID-19 in China with 95% confidence intervals. Prior to the
lockdown of Wuhan17 on January 23, the mean basic reproductive number R0 is 3.86. In the few days prior to the
lockdown, 5 million people, about a third of the city’s population, left Wuhan for Lunar New Year holidays, and R
increased over the following 5 days. With strict social distancing, the epidemic reached an inflection point on
February 14 as daily new cases began to consistently decline. An epidemic is contained when R < 1. Since March
15, most new cases are related to travelers returning from abroad.

Prior to intervention, the mean basic reproductive number, R0, is estimated to be 3.86. Therefore, the
average probability of infection between two contacts is 10.7%, 35.1% for contacts in the household
setting versus 8.26% in non-household settings. (See supplementary materials for calculations.) After
public health measures are implemented under baseline assumptions, the daily mean reproductive
number decreases from 3.86 to 1.99 by social distancing, to 0.79 by isolating all cases at medical
facilities, and to 0.41 by quarantine of case contacts, corresponding to the trajectory in Figure 1. During
the social distancing period, 81% of new cases are predicted to be through household transmission.

Model Validation
In Europe, Italy has become the epicenter of the COVID-19 epidemic18. From population studies of social
patterns in Italy19, during the viral generation period, an infected individual is estimated to have k̅ = 28.5
distinct close contacts, 3.6 contacts in the household setting and 24.9 in non-household settings. degree
of separation 5.35. The predicted R0 is 3.31. (See supplementary materials for calculations.) Again, we
calculate the daily mean reproductive numbers based on open-access daily case reports1 (Figure 2). The
observed R0 is 2.99.

Figure 2: Daily mean reproductive number of COVID-19 in Italy. The estimated mean basic reproductive number R0
is 2.99. On March 8, Northern Italy became quarantined, affecting 16 million people 20. The following day, a
national lockdown advisory was issued21. On March 11, measures were tightened with closure of most retail
services, including fines for violating quarantine orders. On March 21, Italy shut down all non-essential
businesses22.

After social distancing, regional, then national quarantine, the daily mean reproductive number has
been decreasing. Initial social distancing is estimated to reduce contacts from 28.5 to 11.5, that is, an
average of 3.6 contacts in the household setting and 7.9 in the non-household setting, degree of
separation 7.35. Furthermore, the entire population is quarantined at home, with moderate to severe
cases (20%) hospitalized. Therefore, assuming full compliance with social distancing, the reproductive
number is predicted to be 1.03. (See supplementary materials for calculations.) After shutting down all
non-essential businesses on March 21, the average number of unique contacts per individual over each
viral generation period is expected to be 6.6, leading to a predicted reproductive number of 0.97, to be
seen in the coming week.

Model Prediction
In the U.S., we did not find recent publications on population-level studies of social patterns. Therefore,
we assumed that U.S. social patterns are similar to that of Europe19. During the viral generation interval,
an infected individual is estimated to have k̅ = 19.3 distinct contacts, 2.95 in the household setting and
16.35 in non-household settings, and d̅ = 6.63 degrees of separation. Thus, the predicted R0 = 2.39. (See
supplementary materials for calculations.) The initial observed reproductive number became higher
than predicted due to travel-acquired infection on top of community transmission. On March 11, the
U.S. issued a travel restriction to Europe5, that would later include the U.K. After March 17, wide-spread
viral testing in the community identified a wave of new cases.

Figure 3: Daily reproductive number of COVID-19 in the United States. The predicted R0 for community
transmission is about 2.39, that can be seen in the days after the travel restriction to Europe. Since March 17,
increased community testing has identified a surge of new cases.

Assume that currently only 70% of cases are diagnosed due to a shortage of test kits23. Of confirmed
cases, patients with moderate to severe illness (20%) are hospitalized, while patients with mild illness
(80%) are isolated at home. Then to contain the epidemic, in addition to public health measures such as
contact tracing and quarantine, the average number of unique close contacts per person should be less
than 7 over the 5 day generation interval of COVID-19, (3 household contacts and 4 non-household
contacts). (See supplementary materials for calculations.) This increases the degrees of separation to 10.
Lastly, we calculate the threshold above which prolonged social distancing measures are needed.
Without social distancing, if a single individual is infected with COVID-19, the average probability that
any given person will be infected is (R0/k̅)d = (2.39/19.3)6.63 = 0.967 × 10-6, or 1 in 1.03 million. Thus, if
1.03 million people become infected in the U.S., then it is likely that the epidemic will reach every
person through networks of social contact, unless social distancing is kept in place until vaccines and
anti-viral medications become available.

Limitations
This paper provides heuristic estimates of COVID-19 epidemiology without knowing the detailed
structure of the social network. For large networks, estimates using parameter averages can be robust.
There are also numerous factors influencing viral transmission. This simplified model only includes main
variables affecting the epidemiology of communicable diseases. Other factors to consider in the future
include patient age, sex, pre-existing medical conditions, additional settings of contact such as various
workplaces, restaurants, nursing homes, just to name a few. As more factors are taken into
consideration, the social network model can be refined to provide more accurate predictions.

Discussion
The social network model provides a conceptual framework to analyze the COVID-19 pandemic on the
level of individuals, that can be used to predict the influence of collective social behavior on overall
pandemic trajectories. It shows the importance of social distancing, and the message that to contain the
epidemic, every member of the public plays a crucial part in breaking the chain of transmission.
Given the current understanding of COVID-19 viral epidemiology, the epidemic in the U.S. can be
controlled by limiting the average number of contacts per person to 7 unique individuals over each 5
day period. For an average American family, the 7 contacts might be a spouse, two children, a friend, a
neighbor, a colleague, and a cashier during grocery shopping. The time from the beginning of collective
social action to the inflection point of the epidemic is about 3 viral generation intervals, totaling 2-3
weeks. Once daily new cases are decreasing, social distancing measures can be gradually relaxed, in
phases, to prevent rebound of viral transmission.
After social distancing becomes widely implemented and most people stay at home, the majority of new
cases is expected to be from household transmission. One way to further reduce the epidemic is to bring
all patients with confirmed COVID-19 to medical facilities to prevent the spread of infection at home, as
was the practice in China, where moderate to severe cases were hospitalized while mild cases were kept
in isolation centers until they were no longer infectious on viral nucleic acid testing. This is also the
standard of care for other communicable diseases such as tuberculosis, where clinically stable patients
are discharged home after three negative induced sputum samples.
Finally, the social network model of COVID-19 transmission is expandable and extendable. This paper
provides a simplified version using population averages for parameters. Researchers who have access to
patient-level data can substitute these average values by their respective probability distributions to
simulate stochastic viral transmission.
