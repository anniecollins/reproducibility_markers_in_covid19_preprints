Abstract
The problem of facing difficulty to control the spreading of newly detected novel corona
virus 2019 is a matter of attention throughout the whole world. The total numbers of infected
individuals have already crossed 2 million throughout the world. The government of all the
affected countries have already taken many measures like lockdown to stop the spread.
Therefore, it is important to study the nature of growth and interpretations are necessary for
taking needful by the government. In this paper, we have tried to interpret the spreading
capability of novel corona virus in India taking into consideration of 21 days lockdown data.
The prediction is based on the present number of available cases and number of new cases
reporting daily. We have explained the number of infected people in India comparing with
Italy, China, Spain, and USA data of 21 days individually after announcing lockdown. The
plot of daily new cases with the number of days spent after lockdown is fitted by linear and
polynomial function. The best fitted graph is chosen for interpretation and that is based on the
parameters obtained from fitting. The forecast of maximum spreading possibility is discussed
with linear and 4-degree polynomial fitting parameters. Finally, some further preventive
measurements are also discussed.
Keywords: Covid-19, newly arriving case daily, polynomial fit, lockdown.

Introduction
The COVID19 is a potentially severe acute respiratory infection caused by the corona virus
2(SARS-CoV-2). The physical manifestation consists of a respiratory infection with
symptoms ranging from mild common cold to a severe viral pneumonia leading to acute
respiratory distress that is potentially fatal. COVID-19 has been declared as a pandemic
(panic-epidemic) on 11th March by World Health Organization (WHO) all over the world [1].
The existence of corona virus is not new, but this time it has been spread from animal (bat) to
human. The occurrence of having such epidemic had already been predicted last year in
China [2]. The first spread of this novel corona virus was started from Wuhan, China on
December, 2019. Now, almost all the parts of the world are exposed to this virus and since
the inflectibility of this virus is large, a huge number of people have already become victim
of it. In the lockdown situation, all the countries are trying to identify the infected people and
isolate them. So, how many people will be more affected by this virus, is a million dollar
question. For the countries like Italy, USA, Spain, India etc., the number of new cases are
increasing day by day even after the declaration of lockdown by the respective government.
The numbers are following a different trend of increasing for different country. Any natural
phenomena are generally found to follow the exponential growth or decay, but in case of
corona virus, the number of new cases per day is not at all exponential for all the countries.
Many people have predicted the lockdown extension date by modeling the growth as
exponential nature [3,4]. Hence, it is a challenging job to model the growth and to forecast
the number of total affected people.
There has been a long history of research on epidemic deceases in statistical physics
[5,6]. Simple mathematical models and fitting the variation with different polynomial can be
useful for understanding and predicting the epidemic spreading. However, the accurate

prediction of any epidemic spreading is very difficult due to the uncertainty of any modelling.
So far some of the models show that the 49 days lockdown without any break could reach the
baseline [7]. Also, sometimes the data may not be so reliable like the bird flu and SARS
when the number of affected people and deaths were misrepresented to hide the extent of the
epidemic. This type of problem may increase the uncertainty of the prediction and
interpretation. Still, the scientific interpretation of the spreading of any epidemic deceases
helps the government to understand its spreading and to take the necessary steps. The main
problem of forecasting is that the general people fear about the forecasting and prediction of
the spreading like Spanish flu which killed about 50 million people worldwide (1918-1920)
and lasted almost 18 months. After that, no such big epidemic affected people like Spanish
flu. COVID-19 is spreading the whole world like a way that it has affected more than 20 lacs
people and killed more than 1.2 lacs people till now (15/04/2020). Despite this uncertainty,
people have given model, prediction, and forecast on COVID 19 epidemic [8,9].
In this article, we use the data of worldometer [9] to interpret the growth in India with
comparison of USA, China, Italy, and Spain. We have fitted the data of daily new cases over
the days spent after lockdown in different functions like exponential, asymptotic and
polynomial of different order. We have also compared the data with other countries like
China, USA, Italy, Spain etc and tried to find out a trend of increasing or growing number of
corona infected people mathematically. We observe that for China, the trend follows linear
rather higher order polynomial and for USA, Italy, and Spain, it follows 4-degree polynomial
fitting well. However, in case of India, it can be said that it has trend of both 4-degree
polynomial and linear. Finally, we have predicted the underlying reason of maximum
possible spreading of corona virus in India considering both linear and 4-degree polynomial
fitting and suggested some preventive measures to stop this spreading.

About COVID 19
The spreading of this virus has been declared pandemic as it is an infectious diseases that
spreads quickly from person to person. The structure of the virus which has few possible
qualities that allows spreading easily. Firstly, the virus is suggested to be a basically ball of
proteins called spike proteins on the surface. Those spikes latch onto a protein called ACE 2
(Angiotensin-converting enzyme), which is found on the surface of human cells. The original
SERS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) virus also did the same, but the latching onto
ACE 2 is higher due to the specific shape of the spikes of SARS-CoV-2 because they are at
closer fit to the ACE 2 protein. Once the attachment is made, the spike protein is split into
two equal halves by an enzyme called Furin present in human body at large scale. Hence, the
virus gets spread in human body. Most of the respiratory viruses tend to infect either the
upper or lower airways of the respiratory system. If the upper respiratory system is infected
by virus then the illness is very mild and if the lower airways is infected, they cause severe
illness. SERS-Cov-2 seems to infect both the respiratory system due to the wide spread Furin
enzyme. Thus, the virus causes severe contagiousness by attacking upper airways of
respiratory system, which helps it to spread easily before moving to the lower one. According
to the researcher including some research from Cambridge University, there are 3 types of
COVID19 [11,12]. The variants are type A, B and C. The closest type of COVID 19
discovered in Bat was type A, the original human virus genome was presented in Wuhan. The
mutated version of A was seen in American and was also found in the patients of USA. The
A and C types are mainly found in Europeans and American country [12]. The B type is the
most common type variant which is present in East Asia, and its ancestral genome appears
not to have spread outside East Asia without mutation. In India, the type of this virus has not
been publicly reported yet now. Being new with no vaccine and no adequate treatment
protocol, it is challenging for the healthcare workers to combat.

Analysis Method and discussions
In order to investigate the growth of the current epidemic COVID 19, we have taken
consideration of 5 countries. China, being the source of the epidemic, made their lock down
first on 23rd of January. Following this Italy, Spain, USA, and India did the same on later
time. Since the lockdown date is not same for all the countries, we have considered the first
21 days data after lockdown. We have collected the data from very authentic source
“worldometer”. The new cases per day after lockdown announcement are plotted with the
number of days since lockdown. Definitely, the five countries have different data but the
variation of new cases per day with the no. of days seems to be almost identical fashion for
all the countries except China. For better understanding of the nature, we have fitted the data
for all the country linearly and 4-degree polynomial. We also tried to fit the data
exponentially but that cannot be well fitted with that data point. The best fitted graphs are
considered with those fitting covering the maximum data points. Figs. 1 (a)-(f) reveal the
comparison of fitted data with one degree (linear) and 4 degree polynomial for Italy, China,
and Spain. We see that in case of China, the data can be best fitted by a one-degree
polynomial fit, i.e., linear fit, whereas the data points of other countries do not seem to have
any signature of linearity. The variation of daily cases in Italy and Spain can be best fitted
with 4 degree polynomial. Figs. 2 (a)-(d) show the same in case of USA and India. The data
points of all the countries are best fitted using 4-degree polynomial. The coefficients of each
degree are determined and used for further forecast of epidemicity of COVID 19.
Before going into the details of fitting coefficient and their significance, let us discuss
a natural process of spreading such corona virus. We know that the growth of any natural
process follows exponential law. For example, if a person gets corona virus affected;
whenever he/she comes into a country, he/she can spread x no. of people before going to
quarantine. Now, the total number of affected people is (1+x). Again this x number of people

will spread another x no. of people before going to quarantine. Hence, the total number will
become (1+x+x2+x3+x4+…) =

ex.

Therefore, the number of affected people may grow

exponentially for all the countries, but that is not the real case which we want to explore in
this paper. In the case of China, the number of new cases grows almost linearly, whereas for

the other country, it can be best fitted by a 4-degree polynomial. The coefficient of each
degree of the polynomial will have different significance. Each of the country has their
different coefficient and the number of people affected depends on these coefficients and the
intercepts of y-axis (Y0), i.e., the number of initial affected people from lockdown. Let us
consider a polynomial having degree 4, Y(X) = Y0+B1X+B2X 2+B3X 3+B4X 4. Here x is the

days since lockdown and Y is the number of infected people reporting daily. The values of
Y0, B1, B2, B3, and B4 for different countries are listed below in Table 1. The terms B1, B2, B3,
and B4 correspond to the co-efficient of X, X 2, X 3 and X 4, respectively. The terms X 3 and X 4
are responsible for increasing daily +ve cases drastically indicating the community
transmission, which are the crucial factor for spreading. So to control this epidemic, we must
need to control the coefficient of different order of X. The main goal of preventing corona
virus spreading is to attain minima of this graph with keeping the less number of days
lockdown. To attain such minimum, the only way is to control the parameters B1, B2, B3, and
B4. If the coefficient of these two terms (X

3

and X 4) is less, the chance of community

transmission for those countries is also less. These co-efficient are based on number of
population, number of testing and how strict the lockdown are following. The variation of X 3
and X 4 are rapid and uncontrollable than that of X and X 2. Hence, the countries having lower
value of this will reach to the baseline earlier than that having higher value.

Since, in case of China, the data cannot be fitted in a polynomial, hence the coefficient values are not listed in Table 1. Here, it is very obvious that intersects (Y0) are
different for different countries. This value mainly indicates the initial no. of infected people
when the lockdown was declared. It has a significant role for predicting the spreading
mechanism. If we look at the Y0 data from Table 1, we see that USA started lockdown after
they reached the spread of infected people more than 10 thousands, then Spain, Italy, and
India. For India, the value of Y0 is one order less compared to Italy, Spain, and USA. This was
a very good decision by India government that India declared lockdown at early time when
the number of infected people was not so large. For the higher number infected people when
lockdown was declared in USA, the total number of infected people in USA is very high even
after the lockdown period of 21 days than Spain and Italy. India has also one order less

infected people till now even after 21 days lockdown period than Italy, Spain, and USA. We
observe that for Italy, Spain, and India, the values of B2 and B4 are very important for
predicting the number of affected people as B1 and B3 are negative for these countries.
However, for USA, B1 and B3 are dominating factors. The values of B1 and B3 enhance the
daily number of infected people and B2 and B4 decrease the number as these are negative for
USA. In case of Italy, Spain, and India, B2 and B4 enhance the total number of people
affected by corona virus. These co-efficient could well explain the number of affected people.
In case of India, these co-efficient are less than that of Italy, Spain. So, the number of people
infected in India is very less till now compared to Italy, Spain, and USA. However, we should
not conclude that India will soon reach in baseline as the co-efficient of X

is still positive

and it may increase. Also, in case of India, as the sufficient numbers of tests have not been
conducted till now compared to Italy and Spain, the number of daily infected people may be
increased certainly. If B4 increases due to withdrawing lockdown and not maintaining social
distance in near future, then the community transmission effect may be very higher and it
could be a dangerous situation than USA and other European country as the total population
and its density in India are very high compared to other country. So, the lockdown may be
withdrawn only after reducing sufficient number of daily +ve cases and social distancing
should be maintained even after lockdown period for few months. The daily new cases in
India can also be fitted linearly with the no of days since lockdown (Fig. 2d). It is good to
visualize that the daily case in India can be saturated within a few days if the necessary steps
are continued like China. The precautionary measures in medical background are discussed in
next section.

Preventive measures
As the forecast of spreading nature is not absolute, precautionary measures should always be
taken until the spreading becomes almost at zero baseline. We have made some points as
preventive measures which follow as
(i)

We should wash our hand with soap frequently. If the soap is not available, we
should use alcohol based sanitizer.

(ii)

We should not touch eyes, mouth, and nose by our unclear hands as this virus can
go inside our body through eyes, mouth, and nose.

(iii)

Every person should maintain at least 1 meter distance from any people.

(iv)

Social distancing (minimum 1 meter) should be maintained even after the
lockdown period.

(v)

People should avoid gatherings, malls, gyms etc for certain periods.

(vi)

Special care should be taken during using our daily essential things like morning
milk bags, elevators buttons, door bells, newspaper, car doors, raw vegetables and
fruits, and shop counters.

(vii)

Random COVID 19 tests should be done in all localities even for asymptomatic
people.

(viii)

Aerial Sanitization may be done and necessary vigilation should be done with
drone for ensuring lockdown.

(ix)

The hotspot where the number of +ve cases is still increasing should be specially
taken care.

(x)

The international as well as domestic travel by train, flight, bus may be kept
suspended for some days even after lockdown period.

Summary and conclusion
In summary, we have given the explanation of spreading the corona virus infection among
the people by mathematical interpretation. The numbers of new cases are plotted with the
number of days (21 days) after lockdown for India and some other countries for explaining
the nature of the spreading. It is found that except China; Spain, Italy, USA follow the
increase nature as 4-degree polynomial function. However, it is hopeful that India follows the
increase nature as 4-degree polynomial with very low co-efficient values and it also follows
the linear nature like China. Our analysis taking 21 days data after lockdown could explain
the increase nature for USA, Spain, and Italy also. Finally, some preventive measures are
discussed. We invite the researchers from all communities to come forward and work on
COVID 19 according to their expertise. It may be helpful for fighting against this epidemic
disease. Our analysis could give well explanation of daily affected people in last 21 days
lockdown and also in near future. We strongly believe that India will recover soon from the
present situation.
