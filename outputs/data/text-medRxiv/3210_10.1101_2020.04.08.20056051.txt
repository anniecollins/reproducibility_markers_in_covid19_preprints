ABSTRACT
The Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine provides protection against tuberculosis
(TB), and is proposed to provide protection to non-TB infectious diseases. The COVID19 outbreak results from infection with the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (CoV-2)
and was declared a pandemic on March 11th, 2020. We queried whether the BCG
vaccine offers protection against CoV-2 infection. We observed that countries with a
current universal BCG vaccination policy have a significantly lower COVID-19
incidence than countries which never had a universal BCG policy or had one in the
past. However, population density, median age, TB incidence, urban population, and,
most significantly, CoV-2 testing rate, were also connected with BCG policy and could
potentially confound the analysis. By limiting the analysis to countries with high CoV-2
testing rates, defined as greater than 2,500 tests per million inhabitants, these
parameters were no longer statistically associated with BCG policy. When analyzing
only countries with high testing rates, there was no longer a significant association
between the number of COVID-19 cases per million inhabitants and the BCG
vaccination policy. Although preliminary, our analyses indicate that the BCG
vaccination may not offer protection against CoV-2 infection. While reporting biases
may confound our observations, our findings support exercising caution in determining
potential correlation between BCG vaccination and COVID-19 incidence, in part due
significantly lower rates of CoV-2 testing per million inhabitants in countries with
current universal BCG vaccination policy.
INTRODUCTION
Since the early 1920s, the use of the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine has
been implemented in several countries to prevent tuberculosis (TB), a disease caused
by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis primarily
impacts lung function, and may lead to TB-related death. The vaccine consists in
exposure to the M. tuberculosis-related, live, attenuated Mycobacterium bovis strain.
The BCG vaccine thus offers a partial and possibly variable immunity against TB, and
its off-target effect has also been linked to protection against other infectious diseases
[1]. There is evidence from previous outbreak that supports the hypothesis that BCG
vaccination can protect against RNA and DNA viral infections (herpes and influenza)
and other disease such as asthma [2, 3]. These observations have given support to
the possibility of the BCG vaccine providing protection against infection with the novel
coronavirus, SARS CoV-2 (CoV-2). CoV-2 infection results in the disease known as

declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11th 2020. As of April 7th, 2020, 81 countries
around the globe reported over 500 COVID-19 cases.
In most countries with high TB incidence, children receive the BCG vaccine in early
infancy. These countries have implemented a universal BCG vaccination policy. In
some of these countries, when TB incidence dropped, the policy was amended to stop
universal BCG vaccination, and this group is categorized in this report as having
universal BCG policy in the past. A few countries have never had a universal BCG
policy. The reason for not vaccinating was due to low TB incidence and the possibility
to retain use of the tuberculin skin test in order to assess current TB infections. In
countries with active BCG vaccination programs, the variability in protection against
TB could be due to differences in the BCG strains used in vaccine synthesis, vaccine
batch differences, time of vaccination, previous exposure to mycobacterium, and
distinct host haplotypes [4]. The BCG vaccine may offer protection for as long as 30 to
40 years post vaccination (as previously reported in Norway [5]), and possibly as long
as 50 to 60 years, as reported in American Indians and Alaska Natives that participated
in a BCG vaccine trial [6]. In consideration for the potential protection of BCG
vaccination against other infectious diseases including CoV-2 infection, Australia,
which discontinued its universal BCG vaccination in the 1980s, is currently testing
whether the BCG vaccination can protect healthcare workers from CoV-2 infection or
reduce COVID-19-related symptoms (clinicaltrials.gov, NCT04327206). In this study,
we investigated whether the BCG vaccine correlates with reported COVID-19 cases
and mortality.
METHODS
We collected information for BCG vaccination policies, BCG strains, and TB incidence
across all countries from the BCG World Atlas (http://www.bcgatlas.org/). For analysis
of countries with past BCG vaccination policy, countries with a year BCG was
introduced and stopped were included. Data for Israel showed a change in policy in
1982, but did not specify cessation, therefore it was excluded from analysis. The BCG
World Atlas was last updated in 2017. Data of total COVID-19 cases, new COVID-19
cases, first reported COVID-19 cases, mortality, and testing rates for each country was
obtained April 7th, 2020 using https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/. Total
population, population density (population/km2), net migrants, and median age were
obtained from: https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/population-by-country/
(2020).

mortality (2002) was obtained from:
https://www.who.int/cardiovascular_diseases/en/cvd_atlas_29_world_data_table.pdf
World maps were generated using: https://mapchart.net/world.html.
Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics software (build 1.0.1.1347) and Matlab
R2016a. In SPSS, BCG policy was used as the fixed variable, whereas “total COVID19 cases per 1M population” and “percent mortality” defined as deaths per total
COVID-19 cases were classified as dependent variables. Multivariate analysis was
used to derive estimates of effect size and to compute homogeneity tests. Estimated
marginal means were calculated and confidence interval adjustment was done using
LSD post-hoc comparisons.
Univariate and multivariate regression analysis was performed using Matlab R2016a
on log-transformed “total COVID-19 cases per 1M population” and “percent mortality”
defined as deaths per total COVID-19 cases using the fitglme function. All confounding

variables were z-normalized for equivalent scaling, and p values corrected using
Benjamini and Hochberg procedure for univariate comparisons. BCG vaccination
(BCG Vac.) was treated as continuous variable with 0 for never universal BCG policy,
1 for universal BCG policy in the past, and 2 for current universal BCG policy. For
some comparisons, countries were limited to those with testing rates of 2,500 tests per
million and greater, as specified in the results.
RESULTS
As of April 7th, 2020, 211 countries around the world had reported COVID-19 cases.
Among those, 81 countries had more than 500 confirmed COVID-19 cases. Using a
500 confirmed COVID-19 cases cut-off, we ascertained whether COVID-19 incidence
and associated mortality is correlated with BCG vaccination policies. Three countries
(Bahrain, Serbia, and Iceland) did not have information on vaccination policies. Out of
the remaining 78 countries (Table 1), 8% of the countries never had a universal BCG
policy (‘Never universal GCG policy’, Figure 1A). Belgium, Netherlands, Canada, Italy,
Lebanon, and United States of America currently never had a universal BCG policy,
yet all these countries may offer vaccination for high risk subgroups (healthcare
professionals and children with parents from high risk countries). 23% of the analyzed
countries had a universal BCG policy in the past, including many European countries,
Australia, Ecuador, and Israel (‘Universal BCG policy in the past’, Figure 1A). 69% of
the countries currently have a universal BCG vaccination policy, including most
countries in Central America, South America, Africa, and Asia (‘Current universal BCG
policy’, Figure 1A). The number of total COVID-19 cases (with a 500 cut-off) in each
of the three groups is shown in Figure 1B. The number COVID-19 cases per 1 million
(M) inhabitants was significantly reduced in countries with current universal BCG policy
when compared to countries with a never- or in the past- universal BCG policy (Figure
1C and D). The percent mortality per total COVID-19 cases was significantly reduced
in countries with current and past universal BCG policy when compared to countries
that never had a universal BCG policy (Figure 1E and F). These analyses however
indicated that other factors may confound the results, and included population density,
median age, TB incidence, testing rate, and urban population. The following analyses
addressed these potential confounders.
Next, the following parameters were assessed in the univariate analysis: (a) population
density (population/km2), (b) sex (ratio of female and male inhabitants), (c) heartassociated mortality, (d) percent smokers, (e) percent urban population, (f) percent
migrants, (g) age, (h) rate of CoV-2 diagnostic testing, and treating a nation’s BCG
vaccination policy as a monotonically increasing continuous variable (never BCG = 0,
prior BCG = 1, current BCG = 2). Univariate regression analysis on all nations showed
that percent urban population, percent migrants, age, and rates of testing confound
the analysis (Figure 2A). The correlation between specific CoV-2 testing and BCG
policy was robust (Pearson ρ = 0.82, p = 2.4x10-19, Figure 2B). A similar strong, but
negative relationship, was observed between percent mortality and testing rates (ρ =
-0.42 p = 1.5x10-4, Figure 2C). CoV-2 testing rates were significantly different between
countries with distinct BCG vaccination policies (one-way ANOVA p = 6.5x10-5). The
non-overlapping values between different countries with different BCG policies
preclude robust multivariate analysis. To account for this in the subsequent analysis,
we only included “high CoV-2 testing” countries with 2,500 or more tests per million
(N: Current universal BCG vaccination policy = 21, universal BCG vaccination policy
in the past = 17, Never universal BCG vaccination policy = 6), resulting in equivalent
distribution of CoV-2 testing rates across countries with different BCG policies (oneway ANOVA p = 0.17). When comparing countries with high CoV-2 testing, current
universal BCG policy is no longer significantly associated with a reduced number of

COV-19 cases per million (Figure 2D). The number of COVID-19 cases per million
was significantly lower in countries with a current universal BCG policy and low CoV2 testing rates (Figure 2D). For mortality rates in high CoV-2 testing countries, there
was a significant reduction in countries with current BCG vaccination policies, but no
difference was observed in countries with current BCG vaccination policies and low
CoV-2 testing rates (Figure 2E). Univariate regression analysis for number of COVID19 cases per million in high-testing nations indicated that testing rate, percent heart
deaths, and urban population remained as significant co-variates (Figure 2F), though
none were significantly different based on a nation’s vaccination policy (one-way
ANOVA p values of 0.17, 0.14, and 0.27, respectively). Univariate regression of
percent mortality in high testing nations did not reveal any significant co-variates
(Figure 2G). The distinct suppliers for the BCG vaccines did not correlate with number
of COVID-19 cases and mortality, largely because of the scarcity in available data
(Figure 2H).
Our analyses also confirmed the association with implementing universal BCG
policy with countries with high TB incidence (Figure 3A). In the countries with universal
BCG policy in the past, the year in which the policy was discontinued was available for
14 out of the 18 countries in this group. The number of COVID-19 cases per 1M
inhabitants was not significantly different when comparing countries that had
discontinued the universal policy for at least 20 years and countries that had
discontinued the universal policy less than 20 years ago (Figure 3B). The mortality
associated with COVID-19 was not impacted whether the policy for universal BCG
vaccine was discontinued less than or more than 20 years ago (Figure 3B). In the
countries with current universal BCG policy and with available data, there was no
correlation observed in the total COVID-19 cases per 1M inhabitant or percent
mortality per total COVID-19 cases, and the time since implementation of the universal
BCG policy (Figure 3C). There were also no significant correlation observed in the
percent mortality per total COVID-19 cases and the time since the first confirmed
COVID-19 cases in countries that never had a universal BCG policy (Figure 3D), or
had a universal BCG policy in the past (Figure 3E), or have a current universal BCG
policy (Figure 3F).
DISCUSSION
Our independent analysis of COVID-19 cases per million of inhabitant in 78 countries
that were stratified based on the prevalence of BCG vaccination (universal vaccination
policy) shows that, a priori, there is a correlation between current universal BCG
vaccination policy and a lower incidence of CoV-2 infection and related deaths.
However, we note that testing rates (tests per million inhabitants) was positively
correlated with incidence of CoV-2 infection. Taking in consideration this important
bias, we curated the data to compare the number cases amongst countries with distinct
universal BCG policy based on high CoV-2 testing rates, as defined by 2,500 tests or
more per million inhabitants. The results show a lack of significant difference in
incidence of COVID-19 cases in countries with current universal BCG vaccination
policy and countries with never- or in the past- universal BCG vaccination policy. Other
variables tested included population density, percent urban population, percent
migrants, median age, sex, time since the first confirmed COVID-19 case, percent
smokers, and heart associated mortality. Urban population and median age were
significantly associated with increased number of cases; however, their impact were
not as significant as CoV-2 testing rates. Interestingly, COVID-19 associated mortality
was decreased in countries with current universal BCG vaccination policy and similar
CoV-2 testing rates. This may however reflect potential inaccuracies in reporting of
COVID-19 mortalities due to lack of Cov-2 testing. Our study is limited by several

critical considerations, which were not addressed here. These include the variability
and inaccuracies in reporting positive cases and reporting specific mortality associated
with CoV-2 infection, lack of reporting on asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic
cases, the impact of social and economic barriers in accessing care, the association
with other co-morbidities, and the adherence or access to vaccination as per policy. In
this regard, a recent report showed a correlation of universal BCG vaccination policies
and the number of COVID-19 cases when controlling for income [7]. This study
however did not take in consideration CoV-2 testing rates. It is also possible that the
lower rate of CoV-2 testing, combined with lower viral loads in traditionally warmer
countries with higher incidence of tuberculosis, could impact our observations [8].
Although not studied here, host haplotypes may also inform on the incidence COVID19 cases. Finally, time since first exposure rates, as well as population adherence to
social distancing measures, may also influence the evolving COVID-19 data collection.
To date, social distancing remains critical in slowing down the number of new cases
over time. Data from the Australian clinical testing currently underway to assess
whether the BCG vaccination may be protective against COVID-19 (clinicaltrials.gov,
NCT04327206) will likely shed more light on the possible use of BCG in decreasing
CoV-2 infection and associated mortality.
