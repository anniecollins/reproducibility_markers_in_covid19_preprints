Introduction
During the last three months, we have witnessed the fast-growing outbreak of
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) swept through China and rapidly spread to all
over the world. The etiological agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
2 (SARS-CoV-2), was identified as a novel pathogen with high infectiousness to
general population and relatively high mortality rate. According to the lasted data
released by the WHO on 17th March 2020, 184,976 confirmed cases of COVID-19
were reported in 159 countries and regions globally, causing 7,529 deaths.1 Currently,
the epidemic center has been shifted to Europe and WHO advocated that Europe
should learn the lessons from China on infection control. Several COVID-19 studies
from the Chinese researchers

2-5

have provided first-hand knowledge and valuable

treatment experiences on the disease for other countries, but most of the studies were
targeted at adult patients. Although pediatric cases of COVID-19 were constantly
reported, the majority of published studies were case reports or studies with sample
size of less than 50 pediatric cases.

6-11

To determine the spectrum of disease in

children, we collected and analyzed epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and
radiologic data of 74 pediatric COVID-19 cases in two locations of northern and
southern China. We hope our study would further the available knowledge regarding
SARS-CoV-2 infection in children and provide an insight to treatment strategies and
prophylactic control of the disease.
Methods
Data sources
From January 20th to February 27th of 2020, we retrospectively reviewed electronic
medical records of 74 pediatric COVID-19 cases admitted in Qingdao Women's and
Children's Hospital and Wuhan Children's Hospital, including data recorded during
hospitalization and follow-up period. Baseline information (gender, age, weight, time
of onset, time of diagnosis by SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test, time of admission and

discharge), epidemiological history, clinical manifestations, laboratory and radiologic
findings, treatment, outcome and follow-up data were recorded with standardized data
collection forms. This study was approved by the institutional review board of the
ethics committee in our hospital (QFELL-KY-2020-11) and written informed consent
was obtained from patients’ legal guardians prior to enrollment.
Determination of exposure history
Detailed epidemiological data of all cases were collected and classified according to
whether the case was household contacts of confirmed adult patients, the sequence of
infection within the family, and whether the infected children transmitted the virus to
others.
Laboratory confirmation
Confirmation of COVID-19 was based on a positive result for real-time reverse
transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing of SARS-CoV-2 in
nasopharynx swabs by hospital laboratory, and double-confirmed by local Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention using the same RT-PCR protocol. Final decision on
COVID-19 diagnosis was made according to WHO interim guidance. 12
Diagnosis classification
According to the experts’ consensus statement on diagnosis, treatment, and prevention
of 2019 novel coronavirus infection in children issued by group of respirology of
Chinese Pediatric Society,

13

patients were classified into 5 types: asymptomatic

infection, acute upper respiratory tract infection and mild pneumonia, severe
pneumonia and critical cases (acute respiratory syndrome, SARS). The type of mild
pneumonia was further sub-grouped into subclinical type and clinical type depending
on whether the case had clinical manifestation.
Statistical analysis
Categorical data were expressed as number (%) and continuous data were expressed
as median with range or interquartile. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS
software (SAS9.4; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, North Carolina, USA).
Role of the funding source
The funder of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data

interpretation, or writing of this manuscript. The corresponding authors had full
access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to
submit for publication.
Results
Basic characteristics
None of the 74 infected children had comorbidities. Detailed data of baseline
characteristics of the patients were listed in Table 1 and Figure 1 showed the timeline
of disease progression including the following points in time: the date of admission,
diagnosis, and discharge and the final date of follow-up.
Epidemiological characteristics
Complete information of exposure history was collected from 68 of the 74 patients
(91.89%). Except for 3 sporadic cases, 65 (65/68, 95.59%) cases were household
contacts of adults whose symptoms developed earlier and the last confirmed case
within the family, including 18 (27.69%) being the second infected family member,
23 (35.38%) being the third, 14 (21.54%) being the fourth, 9 (13.85%) being the fifth
and 1 (1.54%) being the sixth. There has been no evidence showing the virus was
transmitted from children to others.
Clinical features
Diagnosis and classification: There was only one severe pneumonia case among the
74 infected children, and the rest consisted of 20 cases of asymptomatic infection, 24
acute upper respiratory tract infection cases and 29 mild pneumonia cases, accounting
for 27.03%, 32.43% and 39.19% respectively. Thirty (40.54%) children did not have
clinical symptoms and were identified by SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid screening test,
and 20 of them were finally confirmed as asymptomatic carriers whereas 10 children
were classified as subclinical mild pneumonia patients.
Clinical manifestations: Cough (32.43%) and fever (27.03%) were the most common
symptom at the onset of disease. Other symptoms like fatigue, chest congestion,
anorexia, diarrhea, dyspnea, headache and expectoration were seldom; myalgia,
pharyngalgia, dizziness and myalgia was rather rare. Detailed data are listed in table 1.
Except fever, all the positive signs were related to respiratory system, including

rhonchi and crackles in 16 cases (21.62%). No children showed obvious positive signs
of nervous system and digestive system. The most severe case was a 13-year-old boy
with body-weight of 85 kg who presented with high fever and cough at onset of the
disease, and his fever lasted for 3 days with a highest body temperature of 39.8

.

During hospitalization, he suffered from dyspnea with low proximal oxygen
saturation of 92% on room air and had bilateral diffuse breath sounds of crackles
which could be heard for 5 days.
Laboratory findings (table 1): There were 23 cases (31.08%) with abnormal
leukocyte count, being increased in 19 cases (25.68%) with a highest level of 15.35 ×
109/L and reduced in 4 cases (5.41%) with a bottom level of 2.90 × 109/L. Abnormal
lymphocyte count was found in 10 cases (13.51%), among whom 6 (8.11%) had
increased number of lymphocytes (highest count 9.03 × 109/L) and 4 (5.41%) had
reduced number of lymphocytes (lowest count 0.80 × 109/L). C-reactive protein (CRP)
was increased in 13 cases (17.57%) with a highest serum level of 39.0mg/L. Elevation
of procalcitonin (PCT) was observed in 2 cases (2.70%) with a highest level of
0.75ug/L. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was measured for 14 (18.92%)
patients and 5 (5/14, 35.71%, 12-25 mm/h) of them had accelerated results. Of 74
cases, 34 (45.95%) were screened for common respiratory pathogens and 19 of them
(19/34, 51.35%) had co-infection, including 11 cases co-infected with mycoplasma
pneumoniae (MP), 2 with MP and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), 2 with MP and
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), 2 with cytomegalovirus (CMV), 1 with CMV and EBV,
and 1 with MP, influenza A&B and RSV. Other routine laboratory testing showed no
obvious abnormality. Ten (13.51%) children had RT-PCR analysis for SARS-CoV-2 in
fecal specimens and viral RNA remained positive in stools of 8 convalescent patients
after respiratory specimens showing negative. The time for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in
fecal specimens turning negative after negative conversion in nasopharynx swabs
ranged from 5 to 23 days, with a median of 11days.
Radiologic findings: Four (5.41%) children only had chest computed tomography
(CT) examination once which was done on admission and did not show any
abnormalities. The other 70 (94.59%) children included in this study had chest CT

examination both at the time of admission and discharge. Radiological changes were
found in 37 (50.00%) patients, with 8 (8/37, 21.62%) cases in left lung, 13 (13/37,
35.14%) cases in right lung and 16 (43.24%) cases bilaterally. Of the 37 cases with
abnormal chest CT findings, 30 cases (81.08%) had clinical symptoms, and 7 (7/37,
18.92%) showed no symptoms during the whole course of illness. There were only 9
cases (9/74, 12.16%) with typical changes of SARS-CoV-2 infection in chest CT
imaging, including patches of ground glass opacity which were mainly distributed
near the pleura (Figure. 2). Changes in CT imaging of the other 28 cases was
nonspecific for SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure. 3). No large area of "white lung",
pleural effusion and pneumothorax was found among the patients. Chest CT imaging
of the most severe case only showed abnormalities of common viral pneumonia
(Figure. 4).
Treatment and outcomes: All the 74 cases were treated according to the experts’
consensus statement on diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of 2019 novel
coronavirus infection in children issued by group of respirology of Chinese Pediatric
Society,

13

including interferon inhalation, administration of antiviral drugs and

Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). Fifteen patients with confirmed MP infection
were treated with azithromycin orally or intravenously, and the other 12 children
received empirical antibiotic therapy. Only the 13-year-old severe case was given
systematic corticosteroids for 5 days and gamma globulin for 3 days. No patient
required mechanical ventilation except one severe child who received noninvasive
ventilation for 5 days. All the 74 patients were discharged based on the tentative fifth
or sixth edition for Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 (tentative fifth or sixth
edition) issued by the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China

with good prognosis.

Follow-up results: After being discharged from the hospital, all patients were
remained in quarantine at designated sites for a 14-day medical observation and then
sent for home confinement for another two weeks. At the time of writing, the median
follow-up period of patients in this study was 16.5 (10-42) days. No convalescent
patients discharged from hospital showed clinical manifestation during the study

period, but 3 of the 8 cases with prolonged fecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 were still
positive for RT-PCR analysis till the last day of follow-up.

Discussion
The newly issued Report of the WHO-China Joint Mission on Coronavirus Disease
2019 16 pointed out the attack rate in individuals under 18 years of age was only 2.4%
and no death was reported in this age group. According to the data released by China
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC), 17 416 cases were reported
among children 10 years old and younger with no death case, which accounted for 0.9%
of total COVID-19 cases. Data from local health authorities showed the attack rate
among children ranged from 4.9% to 7.6%. 18, 19 Evidence so far implied that children
are less severely affected by COVID-19, which resembles that of SARS emerged 17
years ago. 20 Familial cluster is one of the common features of COVID-19 in children.
7, 9, 10, 21

Among the 74 pediatric cases included in this study, 68 had complete

exposure history recorded and 65 (95.59%) were household contacts of adults whose
symptoms developed earlier. There has been no evidence showing the virus was
transmitted from children to others. However, the relatively low attack rate of
COVID-19 in children might be explained by the stringent implementation of home
confinement and nation-wide school closure as required by the Chinese governments.
During the outbreak, public activities were discouraged, and children spent most of
their days at home with strengthened protection from caregivers.
This study included clinical, laboratory, treatment, and outcome data of 74
pediatric cases of COVID-19 from two children’s hospitals within and beyond
epidemic center (from southern China and northern China, respectively). All patients
were discharged from the hospital after recovery and were followed up for 14 days.
Clinical presentations of infected children were distinct from that of adult patients.
Except for one critically ill patient, 20 (27.03%) cases were asymptomatic carriers of
SARS-CoV-2, 53 (71.62%) were mild to moderate cases with various manifestations.
Among adult patients, fever (83.0%-98.6%) and cough (59.4%-82.0%) were the most
common and predominant symptoms.

2-5

Whereas fever and mild cough only

accounted for 27.03% and 32.43%, respectively, of symptoms at disease onset and
during hospitalization in our pediatric patients, a proportion much lower than that of
adult patients. Additionally, fatigue, headache, nausea, and gastrointestinal symptoms
were not common among infected children. Nearly half of the children were not
admitted to hospital for symptoms; they were found SARS-CoV-2 positive for
RT-PCR analysis during quarantine after family members had been diagnosed with
COVID-19.
Laboratory findings of pediatric patients were also different from adult patients.
Previous studies have shown leukopenia, lymphopenia, and increased serum levels of
CRP in majority of adult patients.

2-5

Only one third of the 74 pediatric cases in our

study had abnormal leukocyte and/or lymphocyte counts, among whom 19 (25.68%)
had increased and 4 (5.41%) had decreased number of leukocytes; 6 (8.11%) had
elevated and 4 (5.41%) had reduced lymphocytes. Moreover, magnitude of these
abnormalities in leukocytes and lymphocytes was relatively small without typical
changes. Given that children under 6 years of age have higher lymphocyte counts than
adults, further consideration would be warranted for evaluation of these indexes.
There was no pattern for the changes in other infection-related variables such as CRP,
PCR and ESR.
Typical radiologic changes in adult COVID-19 patients include multifocal areas
of ground glass shadows and infiltration in both lungs, and dynamic changes could be
observed as the disease progresses. Abnormalities in lung imaging could be served as
one of the criteria for assessment of disease severity and prognosis according to the
Trial Guideline for Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 (tentative fifth & sixth &
seventh edition) issued by the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic
of China. 14, 15, 22 However, pediatric cases of COVID-19 lacked the typical changes in
chest imaging.

11

Among the 74 cases in this study, only 9 (12.16%) of the 37 cases

who showed abnormalities in CT imaging developed into ground glass opacity;
whereas the rest 28 cases only showed atypical changes for bronchopneumonia and
common viral pneumonia. Nearly half of the cases did not show any Radiologic
changes during course of the disease.

The exact reason for why children are less severely affected is still unclear. One
possible explanation is related to children’s immature immune system. Their adaptive
immunity is less developed to mount an inflammatory response during immune
dysregulation phase induced by viral infection.

23

Relatively stronger humoral

responses in children may also contribute to this phenomenon. Innate immunity is
able to react more rapidly in response to pathogen invasion than adaptive immunity.
Moreover, children generally have fewer comorbidities, making them more resilient
to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Most pediatric patients had relatively mild disease with
good prognosis, which could also be observed in children infected with SARS-CoV
and other respiratory viruses. Compared with pediatric patients, mortality rate of
seasonal flu in adults is nearly 10 times higher.

24

Several studies have shown that

children with SARS only presented with fever, cough and nasal congestion, and
seldom developed into the third phase of SARS (characterized by acute respiratory
distress syndrome). Accordingly, it is difficult to distinguish children with SARS from
infection with other common respiratory viruses.

25-27

Non-specific clinical,

Radiologic and laboratory characteristics of children with SARS-CoV-2 infection
making them hard to be recognized, raising the possibility of misdetection of
asymptomatic carriers. A comprehensive evaluation of epidemiological exposure and
nucleic acid testing results would be warranted to guide clinical decision making.
More attention should be drawn to children with COVID-19 who also have
co-infection with other common respiratory pathogens. Among the 74 pediatric
patients included in this study, 19 (51.35%) of the 34 children who had testing results
for common respiratory pathogens had co-infection; 8 (42.11%) children had two or
more pathogens other than SARS-CoV-2 detected. This finding was consistent with
our previous observation and also in line with studies of others.

28, 29

It can be seen

that co-infection is common in children with COVID-19, indicating SARS-CoV-2
screening is necessary to identify COVID-19 cases, especially during the peak season
for colds, influenza and other respiratory ailments.
With the accumulating experience of COVID-19 management in China, an
increasing number of studies have reported positive RT-PCR results for fecal

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.19.20027078; this version posted March 26, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

SARS-CoV-2 detection or isolation of viable virus from excretions.

30, 31

Xiao and

colleagues demonstrated that viral RNA could exist in stools of COVID-19 patients
for 12 days or longer.

30

Previously we found that RT-PCR testing results for

SARS-CoV-2 remained positive in feces of three pediatric patients for approximately
4 weeks, a duration much longer than that of respiratory specimens (about 2 weeks).
32

Here we simultaneously conducted nucleic acid testing in nasopharynx swabs and

fecal specimens for 10 of the 74 pediatric patients and all of them had positive results
in both samples. Eight children had fecal SARS-CoV-2 positive for RT-PCR analysis
after negative conversion of viral RNA in respiratory specimens. At the time of
writing, three children still had fecal RNA detectable and the longest lagged behind
for 23 days. SARS-CoV-2 may present in gastrointestinal tract for a longer time than
respiratory system, which appears to be more common among pediatric patients.
However, there is limited data on comparison with adult patients. Detection of viral
RNA in feces of convalescent patients does not necessarily mean that the virus are
replication-competent nor infectious enough to be transmitted. There is still a
possibility of fecal-oral transmission. The emerging disease brings new challenges to
preparedness response and prophylactic control, in particular, massive efforts should
be made at all levels to minimize spread of the virus among children after reopening
of kindergartens and schools.
Personalized management should be considered for pediatric patients with
COVID-19, more precisely, to symptomatic and asymptomatic carriers of
SARS-CoV-2 who come from families with a cluster of infection. Treatment plan
should also be tailored for children.

33

Anti-symptomatic therapies including

administration of antipyretics and anti-viral agents, inhalation of interferon, and
enhanced nutrition support were given to children with fever and pneumonia. Only
one critically ill case was given low dose of systemic corticosteroid in a short period
of time. Over half of the pediatric patients were merely under close surveillance and
quarantine and none of them had worsening of symptoms. The most ‘severe’ symptom
during their hospitalization and medical observation was the one at onset of the illness.
More investigations are needed to determine the standardized treatment for pediatric

patients with typical COVID-19 symptoms and to evaluate the efficacy of traditional
Chinese medicine in children.

Limitations
The rapidly evolving COVID-19 outbreak and the lack of specific containment
measures in the early stage caused panic in the community and hospitals. In such
cases, we failed to collect the complete epidemiological information from 6 patients
due. Only blood routine, biochemical and infection-related biomarkers were analyzed
in this study due to the different standards for laboratory testing between the two
hospitals. We were unable to measure the viral loads, or to detect presence of
SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharynx swabs and fecal specimens for all of our patients. We
only screened common respiratory pathogens for children who were admitted to
hospitals in the later stage. But we believe these 74 cases with complete medical
records during hospitalization and follow-up period represented a certain proportion
of pediatric patients of COVID-19 in China.

Figure legends:
Figure 1. Timeline of COVID-19 cases after onset of illness. The interval time was
expressed as median with interquartile.
Figure 2. Chest CT images from a 2-year-old boy showed ground glass opacity near
the pleura of the lower lobe of right lung on day 2 after symptom onset (2A) and the
lesion almost was absorbed after 12 day’s treatment (2B).
Figure 3. Chest CT images from a 7-year-old girl showed bilateral nonspecific
multiple patches along the bronchovascular bundle on day 5 after symptom onset (3A)
and the lesion was absorbed after 8 day’s treatment (3B).
Figure 4. Chest CT images from the severe patient of a 13-year-old boy showed
bilateral nonspecific multi-patchy consolidation opacity near the pleura on day 6 after
symptom onset (4A) and the lesion was absorbed after 11 day’s treatment (4B).
