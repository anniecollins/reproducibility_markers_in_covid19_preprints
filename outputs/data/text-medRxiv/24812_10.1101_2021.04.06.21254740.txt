Abstract
We report a novel piece-wise isothermal nucleic acid test (PINAT) for diagnosing pathogenassociated RNA that embeds an exclusive DNA-mediated specific probing reaction with the
backbone of an isothermal reverse-transcription cum amplification protocol as a unified singlestep procedure. This single step sample-to-result test method has been seamlessly integrated in
an inexpensive, scalable, pre-programmable and portable instrument, resulting in a generic
platform technology for detecting nucleic acid from a wide variety of pathogens. The test
exhibited high sensitivity and specificity of detection when assessed using 200 double-blind
patient samples for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection conducted by the Indian Council of
Medical Research (ICMR), reporting a positive and negative percent agreement of 94.6% and
98% respectively. We also established its efficacy in detecting influenza-A infection,
performing the diagnosis at the point of collection with uncompromised detection rigor. The
envisaged trade-off between advanced laboratory-based procedures with the elegance of
common rapid tests renders the innovation to be ideal for deployment in resource-limited
settings towards catering the needs of the underserved.

1. Introduction
The recurrence of epidemics and pandemics from emerging pathogens like Influenza, Ebola,
Zika, SARS, MERS and the most recent SARS-CoV-2 has continuously exposed global
unpreparedness towards protecting human health, social and economic livelihoods.
Considering the possibilities of asymptomatic infected individuals and similarities in
symptoms associated with infections caused by various pathogens, common clinicalobservation based screening strategies are not adequate to prevent the disease spread. Rather,
systematic, aggressive yet accurate testing of individuals on a community level, contact tracing
and rapid isolation of infected individuals, when synchronized in tandem, may facilitate an
effective management of the epidemic/ pandemic threats. This calls for the development of
generic, rapid, affordable yet highly accurate diagnostic tests, which could be easily

Different variants of molecular diagnostic tests are central to the detection of pathogenic
infections. Point-of-care (POC) immunoassays, alternatively known as rapid antigen or
antibody tests, are extremely attractive for deployment in resource limited settings. However,
these techniques suffer from limited accuracy owing to rapid genetic evolution of the
pathogenic strains and limited abundance of the antigens or antibodies in the body fluid sample,
specifically at the early stage of infection. In sharp contrast, the nucleic acid amplificationbased tests (NAATs) are intrinsically adapted to capture the most fundamental genomic
signature of the infection, and provide a highly sensitive, accurate and reliable approach for
diagnosis. Unfortunately, the resource-intensive nature of the laboratory-based procedures for
nucleic acid testing (such as real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction-RT-PCR), limits
its large-scale dissemination at de-centralized locations. Isothermal nucleic acid amplification
techniques (INAAT), specifically the reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal
amplification (RT-LAMP), have off-late emerged as potential scalable alternative to RT-PCR
(Barreda-García et al., 2018; Foo et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2017, 2016; Xu et al., 2012). The
most attractive proposition of RT-LAMP lies in obviating the need of complex thermal cycling
protocols so that PCR machines do not remain compulsory. The RT-LAMP reaction is simple,
rapid and extremely targeted to identify multiple target regions on the template RNA sequence
of the pathogen for amplification and detection. However, despite great promises, the RTLAMP procedure remains to be extensively applied on a commercial basis, commonly
attributed to the constraints such as carryover contamination (Dao Thi et al., 2020) and indirect
mode of detection. RT-LAMP reactions are monitored through change in colour (Zhang et al.,
2020), turbidity (Tamura et al., 2017) or fluorescence (Shao et al., 2017), which relies upon the
change in the environment of the reaction mixture and hence often produces ambiguous results
with compromised specificity and sensitivity (Zhang et al., 2020). To overcome this problem,
the classical RT-LAMP methods have been recently augmented with the CRISPR-Cas12/13
based detection technology (Broughton et al., 2020; Li et al., 2019), which enhances the overall
accuracy of results through sgRNA mediated specific recognition of the cDNA products.
However, despite enhancing the specificity of the detection, the inherent instability, and off
target effects of sgRNAs point towards the challenges that the CRISPR-based methods may
encounter once brought out of highly controlled laboratory settings.
The most compelling challenge that has largely prohibited the INAATs to be deployed for
community-level testing is the lack of a simple, user-friendly low-cost instrument that can
seamlessly couple any arbitrary isothermal reaction steps customizable with the test protocol.
Advancing substantially from NALF (nucleic acid lateral flow) based test-cassettes
commercialized by BioHelix (Kolm et al., 2019) and USTAR (Fang et al., 2009), there has,
however, been much recent progress in developing fully automated and integrated bench-top
NAAT instrumentation for real-time fluorescence detection in less than 2 hours. However,
several challenges remain unaddressed for rendering their suitability for community care,
including: the need of high voltage power sources (Ramachandran et al., 2020), separate
arrangements for cell lysis, image analysis outside the ambit of device integration (Ganguli et
al., 2020; Reboud et al., 2019), need of large reagent volume per test (Ganguli et al., 2020),
requirement of sphisticated microfabrication steps with inherent complexity, and prohitive cost
of the disposable unit (Lafleur et al., 2016; Roskos et al., 2013; Xu et al., 2020), to name a few.
Further, none of these provides a generic universal platform for integrated sample-to-result

procedure that can be suitably customized as per specific test protocols implementable with
minimal manual steps in a resource-limited setting.

Here, we have presented a series of advancements that overcome the aforementioned
limitations in the reported nucleic acid based molecular diagnostic procedures. First, we
utilized a CRISPR independent but complementary DNA-probe hybridization-based detection
procedure integrated with the INAAT protocol to reconstitute a piece-wise isothermal reaction
(abbreviated as PINAT) with high sensitivity and specificity of detection. The isothermal
amplification reaction and the DNA probe hybridization steps could proceed in a concomitant
fashion so that the entire process could be performed in a single step closed chamber
environment, thus arresting potential cross contamination. In addition, we developed a fullyintegrated low-cost yet generic instrument for performing such tests at point-of-use and
presented the proof-of-principle for an early prototype. This device comprises a preprogrammable thermal control unit to perform piecewise isothermal reaction steps integrated
with a lateral flow assay (LFA) based detection unit. A custom-made mobile app empowered
with image analytics and machine learning capabilities was employed for data interpretation,
thereby eliminating inaccuracies due to manual interpretation. Our method demonstrated high
efficacy in detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection in a double-blind validation process conducted
using 200 patient samples with a positive and negative percent agreement of 94.6% and 98%
respectively. To extend the generality, we also demonstrated the detection of influenza-A virus
RNA directly from infected cells and from virion particles without any additional RNA
purification steps.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Portable device fabrication and operation
The design and drawing of the portable instrument was performed using Autodesk Inventor
Professional 2021, USA. The outer cover of the device was fabricated using 1.1 mm thick mild
steel sheet. The top cover, paper-strip cartridge and microchamber holding cartridges were
developed using additive manufacturing technology with a 3D printer (TECH B V30, India).
The reaction microchambers were fabricated using transparent polymers. Slots compatible with
the sizes of the microchamber units were drilled in the thermal reaction block (heating unit)
made of aluminium. All the components required for the development of the thermal control
unit were made available from local electronic supplies. The Arduino program was generically
developed in-house. The detection unit in the device included a cartridge, holding lateral flow
assay (LFA) strips for the visualization via smartphone camera and subsequent analytics. The
LFA strips were kept in closed cassettes made of transparent polymer sheets and fabricated
using a table-top CNC micro milling machine (T-Tech Inc. USA). (for details see
supplementary information).
2.2. Test protocol for viral RNA detection
For detecting viral RNA directly from virus particles and infected cells, the samples were
heated at 95 ⁰C for 5 minutes prior to the test protocol. The backbone RT-LAMP assay of the
integrated protocol was performed using WarmStart® LAMP Kit (DNA & RNA) from New
England Biolabs (Cat#M1700L). Six LAMP primers (FIP, BIP, LF, LB, F3, B3 ) with specific

DNA probes (5’ FAM modified) complementary to the loop regions of the LAMP product,
named as FLP and BLP, for each gene, were designed and standardized. The overall
standardization procedure included heating at 65⁰C for 30 minutes, 95⁰C for 5 minutes to
inactivate the reaction and then cooling down to 4⁰C. After addition of the specific DNA
probes, the reactions were again heated at 95⁰C for 5 minutes followed by probe annealing at
50⁰C for 5 minutes. In single-step sample-to-result integration protocol, the DNA probes (either
3’ modified or 3’ unmodified) were added at the very beginning of the RT-LAMP reaction,
with subsequent heating at 65 ⁰C for 30 minutes, 95 ⁰C for 5 minutes to inactivate the reaction
and further heating at 50 ⁰C for 5 minutes for probe annealing, seamlessly occurring one after
the other without intermediate manual intervention.
2.3. DNA based probe hybridization and lateral flow assay
10 picomoles of probe were used per reaction for visualizing the hybridized products on LFA
strip. The initial addition of the DNA probe in the RT-LAMP reaction as an integrated singlestep protocol, despite being highly favourable for implementation in a point-of-care format
with minimal intermediate manual intervention, nevertheless necessitated additional
safeguards as this could potentially lead to the concomitant amplification of the probe itself
and hence might interfere with the amplification or specificity of the detection process. To
avoid such adverse artefacts, we included a double modified DNA probe harbouring 6-FAM
and a di-deoxy nucleotide at its 5’- and 3’-termini respectively. Piecewise isothermal reactions
were performed in presence of either regular (5’-6-FAM) or dual modified (5’-6-FAM + 3’ddNTP) DNA probes and subsequently monitored. As evidenced from substantiating
experiments, addition of either the 6-FAM or the 6-FMA-3’ddNTP probes from the very
beginning of the reaction showed signal comparable to the conventional two-step detection
procedure with no non-specific signals in negative control sets. LFA was performed on paper
strips from Milenia Biotec (Germany) following the manufacturers protocol. High specificity
and inherent stability of the complementary DNA probe ensured high accuracy of the test
results even outside the ambit of controlled laboratory ambience.
2.4. In-vitro sensitivity assay
Sensitivity assay was performed using 104 to 1 copy of in vitro transcribed RNA fragments
corresponding to the target gene 1-3. These contrived RNAs were diluted in nuclease free water
containing 100ng/ L or carrier RNA solution for homogeneous distribution of the RNA
throughout the solution and hence improved performance of the assay. 1 µl of the diluted RNA
was mixed into the reaction master mix and thermal protocol was performed. After
implementing the thermal protocol, each reaction was run in 1.5% agarose gel and analysed
using lateral flow assay strip. All the reactions were performed in sextuplets. Before performing
this sensitivity assay, extensive quality checking of the master mix was performed as
mentioned earlier.
2.5. Validation using patient samples against gold-standard RT-PCR test
Virus Research and Diagnostic Lab (VRDL), ICMR-NICED, the regional COVID-testing lab
in the state of West Bengal, India, receives nasopharyngeal swab samples, suspended in viral
transport medium (VTM), of COVID suspected patients referred from hospitals. The clinical
samples were tested by Real Time PCR using standard approved kits (ICMR-National Institute
of Virology ( ICMR-NIV ), 2019a, 2019b). RNA was isolated from 200 µl clinical sample
using QIAamp Viral RNA kit (Qiagen, Germany). A sample was considered confirmed

positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection with a Ct value cut off ≤35. RNase P gene has been used
as internal control for all the patient samples. Considering Real Time PCR as Gold Standard,
RNA panel of 115 positive samples [equal proportion of high viral load (Ct< 20), moderate (Ct
20-28) and High viral load (Ct 28-35)]; 75 SARS-CoV-2 negative samples (Ct undetermined)
and 10 SARS-Cov-2 negative but Influenza A positive (Ct value 20-25) was prepared and
coded. The coded panel was transferred to the designated kit validation unit in double-blinded
form for validation of the PINAT assay. After the test was run, the panel was de-coded and
results of Real Time PCR (Ct values) were compared with PINAT assay.
3. Results
3.1. A generic portable device for detection of viral infection using INAAT based
protocols
The complete implementation workflow from sample collection to result dissemination using
the portable device unit is represented in Fig. 1. (1) The swab/ saliva sample collected from the
patient is subjected to a brief heating step (described in details in the later sections) performed
in heating slots present in the device. (2) The heat lysed sample is subsequently mixed with the
test reagents containing primers, probes and enzymes and dispensed altogether in dedicated
reaction-chambers (microchambers). (3) The piecewise isothermal time-stamped reactions are
held in the portable device without intermediate manual intervention (4) The final products are
then dispensed onto the LFA paper strips and the colorimetric readouts developed therein are
captured using a smartphone camera, for subsequent image analytics and algorithmic
implementation and rapid dissemination of the test outcome.
The generic point-of-care device developed by us comprises a pre-programmable thermal
control cum reaction unit that is capable of performing all the isothermal steps necessary for
the overall test protocol. Notably, the same instrument could be customized to execute any
arbitrary sequences of isothermal protocols standardized for a given test. The microcontroller
based thermal unit of the device includes a heating cartridge, temperature sensor, fan with heat
sink assembly, opto-coupler relay (DC) unit that may either trigger heating through cartridge
heater or cooling through fan–heat sink assembly and a power unit as switchable alternative.
The microcontroller is adapted for selectively carrying out isothermal heating steps including
(a) raising temperature to a desired level (b) holding temperature for a specified time and (c)
lowering temperature to a desired level. The modular reaction microchambers filled with the
test reagents may be placed seamlessly on the heating unit for the intended biochemical
reactions. The heating control circuitry and power supply are operatively connected to the
heating block with a number of slots that can house the reaction chambers. The numbers of
slots can be arbitrarily upscaled to massively parallelize the test procedure.
Once initiated, the entire thermal protocol could be conducted in the closed reaction chambers
without any intermediate user intervention, thereby largely arresting the chance of carryover
contamination. As a further generic protection against contamination, a needle valve fitted with
the reaction chamber was actuated manually to puncture the same at the end of the reaction and
dispense the final product seamlessly to the sample pad of a ‘protected’ LFA strip internally
encapsulated in the device unit via a movable cartridge. LFA buffer was further dispensed on
the strip via a simple dropper to promote capillary-driven transport. The test lines and control

lines in the LFA strip were imaged via smartphone camera, analysed and interpreted via mobile
app. Smartphone integration eliminated a large number of false negative scenarios by utilizing
a dynamic training data set from the previously analysed colorimetric images. The app also
facilitates cloud-based data storage and dissemination. Starting from sample collection, the
entire test for SARS-CoV-2 detection could be performed within 50 minutes.

The heat lysed sample is mixed with a reaction master mix and dispensed to modular
reaction-chambers made of soft polymer tubings for subsequent isothermal
amplification process. The right inset shows the caps of the reaction-chamber for airtight sealing. Piecewise isothermal heating of the reaction-mix occurs in the portable
device unit as a single-step process without any intermediate manual intervention.
Dispensing of the amplified and labelled cDNA product from reaction chamber to the
LFA strip occurs via a manually operated needle valve. Colorimetric detection of the
labelled cDNA is made on the LFA strip. A smartphone app based image capture and
analysis finally display the result onto the mobile screen that could be disseminated in
a controlled fashion through cloud integration.
3.2. Standardization of the PINAT protocol for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 genomic
RNA
The particular PINAT protocol introduced here for the detection of viral nucleic acid is a
generalization and subsequent advancement of the method originally described by Rigano et.al
(2014). The method consists of three distinct and extremely generic steps as described in Fig.
2A. First, RT-LAMP reaction in presence of biotinylated forward inner primer (FIP-5’Bt)
results in generation of 5’ biotinylated RT-LAMP products. Second, a 6-fluorescein amidite
(6-FAM) labelled DNA oligonucleotide (probe), complementary to the loop regions of the RTLAMP products, is hybridized through consecutive heat denaturation and annealing process
thereby generating dual labelled (Biotin + FAM) products. Third, the dual labelled products
and the single labelled free probes get separated on a lateral flow assay strip and captured by
the streptavidin and secondary anti-FAM antibody immobilized on the test line and control
lines, respectively.
RT-LAMP primer sets were designed against three highly conserved target regions in the
SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA (Supplementary Fig. S1 & Supplementary Table S2) that reside
within the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene, the nucleocapsid (N) gene and the
envelope (E) gene (Fig. 2B). Short in vitro-transcribed (IVT) RNA fragments were used for
the standardization of the RT-LAMP reactions (Fig. 2C upper panel). Human RNaseP gene
were used as internal control. For complementary DNA probe-based detection via LFA, we
designed 6-FAM labelled forward and backward loop probes (FLP and BLP) for each targets
and tested specificity. For all target genes, BLPs showed specificity in detection, while, FLPs
weak to moderate nonspecific signals (Fig. 2C, lower panel), which could be attributed to
partial complementarity of 6-FAM labelled probes with biotin labelled primers, as also
supported by our in silico dimer formation analysis. For subsequent experiments, we therefore
used BLPs for specific probing and LFA based detection procedure.
RT-LAMP primers designed for one target gene of SARS-CoV-2 showed no cross reactivity
against other gene targets (Fig. 2D, upper panel). Additionally, the products amplified from
one gene target could only be detected with the corresponding BLPs (Fig. 2D, lower panel),
ensuring the high specificity of our double layered detection method. The method also showed
no cross reactivity against the genomic RNAs of other corona viruses including SARS, OC43,
NL63, 229E and HKU1 (Supplementary Fig. S2B) as well as other RNA viruses like Influenza
A, Influenza B or Japanese Encephalitis Virus (JEV) genomic RNAs (Supplementary Fig.
S2A) and hence confirmed that it can specifically detect and distinguish SARS-CoV-2
infection from infections caused by other viruses with similar clinical presentations.

In vitro sensitivity assay was performed to ascertain the limit of detection (LOD) of our method
for individual target genes. Individual reaction sets containing 104 to 1 copy per microliter of
the contrived RNA samples were then subjected to the PINAT reaction in sextuplets. Primers
and probes corresponding to all of the gene targets showed the ability to consistently detect
100 copies of RNA molecules in six out of six replicates (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig. S3).
For the replicates containing 10 copies of RNA, N gene, RdRp and E gene primer sets showed
5/6, 4/6 and 3/6 positive detections, respectively, suggesting the following order of sensitivity:
Target 1(RdRP)> Target 2(N)> Target 3(E). All of the gene targets exhibited inconsistent
results for higher dilutions suggesting a limit of detection as 10 copies per microliter.
Summarily, the PINAT method demonstrated the capability of detecting 10 copies of viral
RNA reliably for majority of replicates and 100 copies of viral RNA for all of the replicates,
which is comparable to or superior than other RT-LAMP based detection technologies reported
in recent times(Broughton et al., 2020; Dao Thi et al., 2020).
3.3. PINAT test for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients under resource
limited settings
The high specificity and sensitivity of the PINAT test in the in-vitro experiments prompted us
to evaluate its efficacy in detecting the presence of SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA in the
nasopharyngeal swab samples isolated from patients. For this purpose, we set up an
experimental model which could mimic performing the diagnostic procedure in a remote
location in resource limited setting. We pre-aliquoted ready-to-use reaction-mixes in the forms
of packed test kits that were transported from our lab to the patient sample testing centre over
a road-travel duration of several hours and subsequently stored in a normal refrigerator at 4ºC
overnight before performing the test procedure (Supplementary Fig. S4 A & B). Purposefully,
no specific attention was laid to perform the test in controlled ambience.
We used RNA extracted from 200 double-blinded patient samples, among which 115 were
positive and 85 were negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection as determined by the ICMR-NIV
developed RT-PCR assay, with the Ct values distributed in between the range of 15 and 35.
We employed the primers specific to N gene and RdRp to detect the presence of viral RNA as
these two target gene sets showed higher sensitivity than E gene target (Fig. 3A). RNaseP was

used as internal control. All the test reactions were performed using the portable instrument
and the final results were recorded and analyzed with the help of the custom-made app trained
with the algorithm mentioned in Table 1. Briefly, a test with both the gene targets showing
positive results were considered as infection positive while negative results with both of them
confirmed negative infection. For samples (observed mostly with high CT values) with one
gene target showing positive and other showing negative results, the test was repeated and
repetition of the exact same trend confirmed positive infection (Fig. 3B). Considering all 200
patient samples, our method showed a positive percentage agreement 93.91% and negative
percent agreement 97.64% (Fig. 3C, 3D and Table 2). However, for the samples of Ct values
30 and below, which acts as a suitable reference for clinical decision making, the positive
percent agreement values reached to 98.79% (Fig. 3C). To overrule the cross reactivity of the

nasopharyngeal samples. All the Influenza positive samples showed negative results for the
presence of SARS-CoV-2. This data confirms that the test is capable of detecting SARS-CoV2 infection in patient samples with high, moderate and low viral loads with superior sensitivity
and specificity. Additionally, our experimental model confirms that our test method is suitable
to be implemented in the remote areas with limited infrastructure and resources.

3.4. One step sample-to-solution integration for detection of RNA virus infection
Next, we attempted to standardize a single step swab/ saliva-to-result protocol that could be
implemented without changing the basic principle of the PINAT work-flow. For this purpose,
we first incorporated an integrated approach for detecting genomic RNA directly from the virus
particles or from the infected cells using Influenza A virus as a model system. The PINAT
protocol, was standardized for detecting the segments of seven (open reading frame M2) of
influenza A/H1N1/WSN/1933 virus genomes (Supplementary Fig. S5). Subsequently, we
performed a simulated clinical experiment where influenza A virus infected human lung
epithelia cells (A549) were re-suspended in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) spiked with human
saliva collected from an infection negative donor. A saliva-PBS suspension containing 100
such cells was then subjected to a brief pre-heating step (950C for 3 minutes) in the portable
instrument before being used as an input for the subsequent steps of the PINAT protocol. This
adapted protocol was successful in consistently detecting both influenza virus RNA as well as
the RNaseP mRNA from the heat ruptured cell lysate either in absence or presence of saliva
(0.5% final concentration) (Fig. 4A and Supplementary Fig. S6). Additionally, this protocol
was also capable of detecting as low as 500 influenza virion particles (measured in terms of
plaque forming units-PFU) diluted in PBS without any additional RNA extraction process in
absence of saliva (Fig. 4B and Supplementary Fig. S7). In dilution containing saliva (0.5%
final concentration), the method shows a sensitivity of 2500 plaque forming units which is
much lower than the usual viral load in a patient showing clinical symptoms(Ward et al., 2004).
Similar experiment was performed to ascertain the limit of detection (LOD) for SARS-CoV-2

N gene target in the presence and absence of saliva. Encouragingly, even in presence of saliva,
our modified method could successfully detect up to 100 and 10 copies of contrived N gene
fragment in 5/6 and 4/6 replicates, which is comparable to the saliva negative controls (Fig. 4C
and Supplementary Fig. S8). This ensures high sensitivity and robustness of the N gene target
specific primers in amplifying corresponding gene fragment in stringent experimental
conditions.
The other exclusive aspect of saliva to result integration, as mentioned earlier, is combining
the specific DNA probe hybridization step with the initial amplification step, thereby excluding
any in-between manual intervention during the test reactions. For this purpose, we added the
6-FAM labelled complementary DNA probe (BLP) from very beginning of the reaction
practically resulting in a master mix which contains all reaction components in it (enzyme mix,
RT-LAMP primers, and DNA probe). Hence, mere addition of the input RNA to the master
mix and subsequent initiation of the thermal protocol could result in dual labelled products
which then could be subjected to detection. As evidenced, addition of either the 6-FAM or the
6-FMA-3’ddNTP probes from the very beginning of the reaction showed signal comparable to
the conventional two-step detection procedure with no non-specific signals in negative control
sets in either of these cases (Fig. 4D and Supplementary Fig. S9 & S10). Together, this
modification along with the saliva-to result integration in the PINAT protocol, when
implemented with the help of the instrument innovated by us, holds the potential to
revolutionize the nucleic acid-based detection of virus infection and essentially bring high-end
molecular diagnostics from sophisticated labs to the field.

Fig. 4. A single step solution for detection of RNA virus infection. (A) Detection of
influenza A virus genomic RNA directly from infected cells in the presence or absence
of human saliva. Human A549 cells infected with influenza A virus, or mock infected,
were resuspended in PBS or PBS spiked with human saliva. The suspension was
subjected to the detection procedure without prior RNA extraction procedure, but
heating at 95⁰C for 3 minutes. (B) Defined numbers of influenza virion particles (PFU),
amplified from MDCK cells, were subjected to detection procedure (as mentioned in
A) in sextuplets either in presence or absence of human saliva. (C) 10-fold serial
dilutions of in vitro synthesized N gene fragment were subjected to detection process
in sextuplets either in presence or absence of human saliva. (D) Simultaneous
amplification and probing for detection of viral RNA in a single step. RdRp Gene
fragment was subjected either to RT-LAMP followed by probing in a sequential manner
or simultaneous RT-LAMP and probing reaction in a single step process. In both the
cases, BLPs labelled with 5’-FAM and with and without 3’-ddNTP modification were
used. Products, at the end of the reaction, were subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis
in absence of EtBr and imaged under Cy5 channel.
4. Conclusions and outlook
We developed an integrated highly-accurate one-step nucleic acid test, which is a combination
of isothermal amplification, complementary DNA probe hybridization and subsequent
detection via lateral flow assay. This method could be performed in a seamless swab-to-result

format in a generic inexpensive portable device (~USD 75.0), thus enabling the scalable
deployment of the diagnostics at the point of collection with no discernible compromise in the
detection rigor. While relying upon the same basic backbone of isothermal amplification, the
present PINAT test attempted to overcome certain practically-inhibiting propositions of the
recently-introduced test methods that deploy CRISPR based detection methodology. For
instance, the complementary DNA probe-based detection of the present test excludes any
reagent-stability concerns as in the case of the sgRNA-mediated detection steps of CRISPRbased technology, when implemented outside controlled laboratory set-up. Furthermore, the
DNA probing step can be implemented in a united fashion with the preceding isothermal
amplification protocol in contrast to the CRISPR based method where the sgRNA and
Cas12/13 complex should be freshly prepared and added after cDNA amplification. This
renders the entire PINAT test implementable as a single close tube reaction-sequence without
in-between manual intervention, thereby reducing the chance of carryover contamination and
the concerned procedural complications to a large extent.
Beyond any specific test protocol, another significant advancement reported here is the generic
instrument established as a platform technology which is low cost, user-friendly, customizable
and amenable to massive scale-up and parallelization. There is no disposable cartridge except
simple paper strips and the reaction chamber, favouring manufacturing scale-up. Each
instrument is connectible to secure cloud-based database via smartphone-internet connectivity,
enabling a seamless dissemination of the test outcome directly to clinical information systems.
The availability of such easy-to-use and reasonably sensitive detection method as a generic
platform technology may potentially capture commonly missed instances of early infection and
asymptomatic disease presentation and reduce the opportunity for community-level
transmission of a large number of diseases. This could result in dramatic improvements in
disease management and epidemic/ pandemic control in several unforeseen events in the future.
In essence, by exploiting the universal generic structure of innovated test, one may envisage
the paradigm of advanced nucleic acid-based diagnostics in the format of a rapid test for several
different pathogens. This hybrid paradigm, essentially an amalgamated format with a trade-off
between the scientific standards of advanced molecular diagnostics with the elegance of
common rapid tests, appears to be the future of diagnostics for the underserved.
