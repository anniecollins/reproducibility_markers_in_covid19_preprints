Abstract
Objectives: Physical inactivity is more common in older adults, is associated with social
isolation and loneliness, and contributes to increased morbidity and mortality. We examined
the effect of social restrictions, implemented to reduce transmission of COVID-19 in the UK
(lockdown), on physical activity (PA) levels of older adults, and the demographic, lifestyle
and social predictors of this change.
Design: Baseline analysis of a survey-based prospective cohort study
Setting: Adults enrolled in the Cognitive Health in Ageing Register for Investigational and
Observational Trials (CHARIOT) cohort from GP practices in North West London were
invited to participate from April to July 2020.
Participants: 6,219 cognitively healthy adults aged 50 to 92 years completed the survey.
Main outcome measures: Self-reported PA before and after lockdown, as measured by
Metabolic Equivalent of Task (MET) minutes. Associations of PA with demographic, lifestyle
and social factors, mood and frailty.
Results: Mean PA was significantly lower following lockdown, from 3,519 MET
minutes/week to 3,185 MET minutes/week (p<0.001). After adjustment for confounders and
pre-lockdown PA, lower levels of PA after lockdown were found in those who were over 85
years old (640 [95% CI: 246 to 1034] MET minutes/week less); were divorced or single (240
[95% CI: 120 to 360] MET minutes/week less); living alone (277 [95% CI: 152 to 402] MET
minutes/week less); reported feeling lonely often (306 [95% CI: 60 to 552] MET
minutes/week less); and showed symptoms of depression (1007 [95% CI: 1401 to 612] MET
minutes/week less) compared to those aged 50-64 years, married, co-habiting, and not
reporting loneliness or depression, respectively.
Conclusions and Implications: Markers of social isolation, loneliness and depression were
associated with lower PA following lockdown in the UK. Interventions to improve PA in older
adults should take account of social and community factors, and targeted strategies to
increase physical activity in socially isolated, lonely and depressed older adults should be
considered.

Background and Rationale

Physical inactivity (PA) adversely affects older adults, with 60-70% of those aged
over 75 years not sufficiently active for good health1,2 as defined by meeting World Health
Organization (WHO)3 and UK4 guidelines. From March until June 2020 in the UK, a national
‘lockdown’ was implemented to reduce exposure to, and transmission of, COVID-19.
Although applied to the whole population, adults aged over 70 years and those with
underlying health conditions at higher risk of severe COVID-19 disease were asked to follow
more stringent social distancing measures. These included remaining at home where
possible; avoiding social mixing in the community; avoiding physically interacting with friends
and family; and avoiding public transport.5
Social isolation and loneliness in older adults, possibly exacerbated during lockdowns,6 is
associated with increases in morbidity and mortality, and also with increases in physical
inactivity and sedentary time, as shown from subjective self-reporting and from
accelerometer data.7,8 Physical inactivity may therefore have a role in mediating the
increased morbidity and mortality associated with social isolation.9 We set up the CHARIOT
COVID-19 Rapid Response study (CCRR) in April 2020 to monitor symptoms and the impact
of the COVID-19 pandemic on various health and lifestyle factors, by repeat questionnaire
survey of the Cognitive Health in Ageing Register for Investigational and Observational Trials
(CHARIOT) members.

We hypothesised that imposed social restrictions would negatively impact on PA levels of
older adults, and that change in PA after lockdown would be modified by certain
demographic, lifestyle and social factors, with a focus on markers of social isolation and
perceived loneliness. An awareness of the extent of, and predictors for, change in PA levels
will aid our understanding of the impact of social isolation on the health of older adults, both
with respect to pandemic-related lockdowns and social isolation itself.

Methods

2.1 CCRR survey
Study participants were recruited from the CHARIOT register, a cohort of over 40,000
cognitively healthy adult volunteers aged over 50 years, recruited from 172 GP surgeries
across West and North London as part of a collaboration between regional GP practices and
the School of Public Health, at Imperial College London.

This ongoing prospective cohort study was initiated in April 2020 with repeated questionnaire
surveys conducted every six weeks. The CCRR baseline survey consists of questions
related to basic demographics, diet, alcohol and smoking status, symptoms of COVID-19,
functional activities, physical activity, sleep, frailty and mental health (supplementary file 1).
For physical activity, the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) short-form was
used,10 asking respondents to document their weekly vigorous and moderate activity,
walking and sitting time from the week prior to completing the survey; and for the week prior
to implementation of social restriction measures. For assessing frailty, the 5-point FRAIL
scale,11,12 and for assessing mental health symptoms, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression
(HADS) scale,13 were used. A question on loneliness was used from the Imperial College
Sleep Quality questionnaire; in turn adapted from the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index14 and
Centre for Epidemiologic Studies of Depression Scale15, for work-free periods.
The survey was sent to 15,000 CHARIOT participants via email, with a subsequent
25,000 contacted by post. 7,320 participants responded and completed the survey. Of these
respondents, 6,219 completed IPAQ data both before and after introduction of lockdown
measures and were included in the final analysis. Data used in the present analysis were
completed between 30th April and the 22nd July 2020.

2.2 Statistical analysis
All analyses were conducted using Stata version 16.1 (StataCorp 2019) and R.16,17
Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of
height in metres and categorised according to standard WHO criteria. IPAQ data were
cleaned according to the IPAQ data cleaning protocol,18 and the Metabolic Equivalent of
Task (MET) minutes per week, calculated for each activity and total activity (supplementary
file 2). Paired t-tests were used to compare the distributions of mean PA levels pre- and
post-lockdown.
Measures of association with explanatory variables were explored in univariable linear
regression models for two outcomes: i) overall weekly MET minutes after introduction of
lockdown and ii) the difference in overall weekly MET minutes before versus after the
introduction of lockdown. Multivariable models were constructed for the outcome of MET
minutes after lockdown, adjusting a priori each explanatory variable in turn for age, sex and
ethnicity. Month of survey completion was also included in the model to account for seasonal
changes, and the finding that physical activity after lockdown varied by month
(supplementary file 2: figure 2). Weekly MET minutes before lockdown was also included in
the model given its strong association with activity levels after lockdown, which remained

significantly associated in all models. Denominators for each model vary according to the
levels of missingness in variables included in the models, which was low for most variables,
except for BMI (unrecorded in 51.4% of participants).
A causal diagram was constructed using DAGitty19 (supplementary file 2: figure 4) to aid
adjustment for confounders in order to separate the overall causal effects of marital status,
loneliness and living alone on physical activity. Additional multivariable models were then
constructed based on the causal diagram for loneliness, adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity,
household status, marital status, shielding status and frailty category. No further adjustment
was necessary for marital status or household status. Residuals were plotted against fitted
values to assess for outlying points and heteroskedasticity; and plots of Cook’s distance and
leverage against fitted values were examined to detect the presence of influential points.
3.0 Results
3.1 Participant characteristics
Of the 6,219 participants included in the present study, 55.4% were female, and the
majority (55.3%) were aged 65-74 years with a mean age of 70 years. 93.7% of respondents
classified themselves as being of white ethnic background, with 2.8% of Asian ethnic
background, and only 0.7% of black African or Caribbean background. Approximately half of
participants (48.6%) had a recorded height and weight, with a mean BMI of 25.3 kg/m2. The
majority of respondents were married (62.2%), co-habiting (72.8%) and retired (69.5%).
Most respondents did not smoke (96.9%), drank alcohol (82.6%) and felt they ate a healthy
diet (80.3%). 18.0% of respondents were classified as pre-frail, with 0.5% as frail and 26.2%
reported that they were shielding at the time of the survey (table 1).
3.2 Physical activity before and after social distancing measures
Mean (SD) PA for participants prior to lockdown was 3,519 (2867) MET
minutes/week. There was a significant reduction in mean MET minutes following
implementation of lockdown to 3,186 (2673) MET minutes/week (p<0.001; table 2 & figure
1). 3,167 (50.9%) participants decreased their activity during lockdown by a mean (SD) of
1,957 (2025) MET minutes/week, 534 (8.6%) maintained the same level of activity, and
2,518 (40.5%) increased activity by a mean (SD) of 1,636 (1775) MET minutes/week. Mean
sitting time increased by 276 MET minutes/week after lockdown (2,680) compared to before
(2,404) (table 2).
5,762 (92.7%) participants achieved at least the minimum guidance of 600 MET
minutes/week of activity, as defined by WHO,3 prior to implementation of lockdown
measures, slightly reducing to 5,672 (91.2%) following their introduction (p<0.001). 5,039

(81.0%) achieved 1,200 MET minutes/week before lockdown, with 4,904 (78.9%) achieving
this after lockdown (p<0.001). Following lockdown, PA levels varied by month of survey
completion, with the highest levels in June and lowest levels in July. There was no significant
difference between self-reported PA before lockdown by month of survey completion
(supplementary file 2: table 1 & figures 2-3).
3.3 Predictors of physical activity after lockdown, and change from before lockdown
3.3.1 Demographic and lifestyle factors
Univariable linear regression models showed statistically significant associations with
lower PA after lockdown in older age groups but no evidence of differences in the change
from before lockdown between age groups (p<0.001 and p=0.184, respectively; figures 1 &
2). After multivariable adjustment for sex, ethnicity, month of survey completion and prelockdown physical activity there was evidence of significantly lower levels of PA with
increasing age, with adults aged 85 years and over doing on average 640 (95% CI: 246 to
1034) MET minutes/week less than those aged 50-64 years (figure 3). There was no
significant difference in PA after lockdown in males and females (p=0.180), but females on
average exhibited a greater decline in PA from before lockdown than males (450 vs 189
MET minutes/week less respectively; p<0.001; figures 1 & 2). After multivariable adjustment,
including age, there was only a small and borderline significant difference in PA after
lockdown between gender (PA in males on average 108 MET minutes/week more than
females; 95% CI: -1 to 216; figure 3). No significant associations were seen between PA
after lockdown or change in PA according to ethnicity or employment status, before or after
adjustment.
Lower levels of PA after lockdown were seen with increasing BMI category, in current
smokers and in those reporting an unhealthy or worsening diet before and after adjustment
(figure 1). After adjustment, a dose-response relationship was evident between lower PA
and increasing BMI (p=0.030), with obese individuals doing 578 (95% CI: 324 to 832) MET
minutes/week less than those of a healthy weight (figure 3). The denominator included in
analyses of BMI was significantly lower than for other models, as BMI was unrecorded for
51.4% of participants. Current alcohol consumption was weakly associated with increased
levels of PA in both univariable and multivariable models, with current drinkers reporting 145
MET minutes/week more than non-drinkers after adjustment (95% CI: 1 to 289; figures 2 &
3).

Participants who were divorced, single or widowed were, on average, less active
after lockdown than those married or living with a partner (3,026 vs 3,262 MET
minutes/week; p=0.001); and exhibited a greater decline in PA from before lockdown (540 vs
236 MET minutes/week less; p<0.001; figures 1 & 2). The association with PA after
lockdown remained after adjustment, with those divorced, single or widowed doing on
average 240 (95% CI: 120 to 360) MET minutes/week less (figure 3). Participants living
alone were also less active than those co-habiting and showed greater reductions in PA from
before lockdown. After adjustment for confounders and PA before lockdown, those living
alone were doing 277 (95% CI: 152 to 402) MET minutes/week less than those co-habiting
(figure 3).
Significant associations were seen between PA after lockdown and frequency of loneliness,
with those ‘often’ experiencing loneliness achieving 2,938 MET minutes/week compared with
3,284 MET minutes/week in those ‘never’ experiencing loneliness (p=0.024; figure 1).
Greater declines in PA from before lockdown were also seen with increasing loneliness
(figure 2). After adjustment, PA after lockdown was significantly lower for those with
increased frequency of loneliness (figure 3). After full adjustment including, in addition,
household status, shielding status and frailty category, those experiencing loneliness ‘often’
reported 306 (95% CI: 60 to 552) MET minutes/week less activity than those ‘never’ lonely
(supplementary file 2: table 4).
Significantly lower physical activity levels were recorded in those shielding and in
participants categorised as pre-frail or frail (both p<0.001; figure 1). Larger declines in PA
from before lockdown were seen in those shielding compared to those not shielding (588 vs
243 MET minutes/week less; p<0.001), but there was no significant difference in change in
PA according to frailty category (p=0.389; figure 2). After adjustment, frail participants were
doing 926 (95% CI: 189 to 1,663) MET minutes less on average than those classed as
robust (figure 3). Participants who were shielding were doing an average of 290 (95% CI:
163 to 417) MET minutes/week less than those not shielding (figure 3).
3.3.3

Associations with depression and anxiety
Symptoms of depression were associated with lower levels of PA during lockdown,

with those meeting the criteria for depression reporting 2,450 MET minutes/week compared
to 3,195 MET minutes/week in those with normal scores (p<0.001; figure 1). There was no
strong association with anxiety scores. Mean change in PA from before lockdown was
associated with both depression and, in contrast to absolute PA levels, with anxiety scores.
Participants with depression reported 1,450 MET minutes/week less on average after
lockdown compared with before, while those with normal scores reported 293 MET

minutes/week less (p<0.001). Similarly, in those with anxiety, PA reduced by 836 MET
minutes/week compared to 312 MET minutes/week in those with normal scores (p=0.004;
figure 2).
After adjustment, those meeting the criteria for depression on the HADS scale had
significantly lower PA levels than those with normal scores, doing on average 1,007 (95%
CI: 1401 to 612) MET minutes/week less (figure 3). There remained no statistically
significant association between anxiety score and physical activity after adjustment.

Discussion

4.1

Main findings
Data from the CCRR study show that participants experienced, on average, a significant

decrease in PA after the introduction of lockdown in the UK when compared with before,
together with an increase in sitting time. When adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, month of
survey completion and baseline physical activity, factors strongly associated with a reduction
in PA include; increased age, increased BMI, frailty, current smoking, and a change to a less
healthy diet. Factors associated with social isolation were also significantly associated with a
reduction in PA: those divorced, single or widowed, living alone, shielding or reporting
increased frequency of loneliness did significantly less PA after lockdown. Furthermore, a
strong association was also seen with lower PA during lockdown in those with depression,
but not for those with anxiety.
4.2

The effect of lockdown on physical activity
There was a reduction in PA in over half of our participants, and a decrease in mean

levels of PA by 333 MET minutes/week following the introduction of lockdown measures in
the UK. This was accompanied by an increase in sitting time by 276 minutes per week, an
adverse finding given the adverse health impacts associated with increased sedentary and
sitting time.20 These findings correlate with other studies from the UK (a decrease in 25% of
adults aged over 20 years following lockdown),21 Spain22 and China,23 and from a global
survey collected in 8 different languages,24 despite the differences in outdoor exercise
permissions between countries. Reductions in PA may impact disproportionately across
society. We found that increasing age associated with a reduction in PA after lockdown,
corresponding with that seen in Japan, with a 26.5% (65 minutes) decrease in total physical
activity in adults aged 65 to 84.25 A self-reported study in the UK found that those with a
diagnosis of obesity, hypertension, lung disease, depression or a disability were more likely
to reduce PA during lockdown.21

4.3

Social relationships, loneliness, and physical activity
Individuals for whom social engagement was more likely to be restricted, such as

those who were shielding, divorced, single, widowed, or living alone, were more likely to
have lower levels of PA after lockdown, and to have declined to a greater extent. Similarly,
those who subjectively reported feeling lonely were more likely to have lower PA levels, and
greater declines from before lockdown. These associations remained significant after
multivariable adjustment.
Associations between health behaviours, including PA, and social relationships have been
noted previously. Data from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) showed that
socially isolated respondents were less likely to report healthy diets, and more likely to
smoke.7 Crucially, they showed reduced activity counts in socially isolated individuals
(measured by accelerometer) in a sample of adults older than 50 years,8 and reduced selfreported moderate to vigorous physical activity.7 This is particularly important given that
isolated and lonely individuals are at an increased risk of morbidity and mortality from
cardiovascular events, with the majority of this association mediated by risk factors which
include physical inactivity.26 Fixed effect models from the ELSA cohort show that social
disengagement, domestic isolation and loneliness are associated with measures of poorer
physical performance, and although they appear to be independent of physical activity, may
still be associated along the causal pathway.27 Studies of spousal pairs found that both men
and women in married couples had greater levels of PA than their single counterparts,28 and
changes in PA are positively associated with changes in the PA of a spouse.29 Increasing PA
is associated with larger,30,31 more diverse32 and more heterogenous (in terms of PA) social
networks, and having more physically active people in a social network is associated with
being more active.33
The interaction between social relationships and PA levels may be bi-directional. Levels of
PA are influenced by multiple factors at different levels, including individual (psychological,
genetic); interpersonal (social networks); environmental (social, built, natural); and regional
or global determinants.34 Social networks might influence PA through social support for
individuals to take up and maintain activity, but also by regulating social norms, and
associating PA with social connections or attachments.35 There may also be increased
opportunities for PA33 when social networks are present.
4.4

Mood, health behaviours and physical activity
In those reporting symptoms of depression, there were significantly lower levels of

PA and a significant decrease in activity when compared to before lockdown. These findings
correlate with those from the UK,36 Australia,37 and Spain,38 which found inverse

sectional study of Brazilian adults who were self-isolating found lower odds of symptoms of
anxiety or depression in those who were performing over 30 or 15 minutes per day of
moderate or vigorous activity respectively, and higher odds in those with prolonged
sedentary time over 10 hours.39 The associations between PA and mental health are well
known, with positive impacts on wellbeing,40 and reduced incidence and severity of
symptoms of mental ill-health.41–43 Therefore, these findings are unsurprising, although the
interaction between PA and reduced markers of mental ill-health in older adults may be bidirectional. Moreover, social isolation and loneliness may mediate some of this effect:
previous data from the CCRR cohort showed an interaction between social isolation,
loneliness, and female gender with worsening depression and anxiety over lockdown.44 We
found no statistically significant difference in PA during lockdown with anxiety symptoms, at
odds with previous studies.36 However, the trajectory of anxiety symptoms is not known, and
it is not clear whether anxiety symptoms pre-dated the introduction of lockdown.
4.5

Health behaviours and physical activity
A decrease in PA was associated with other detrimental health behaviours, including

unhealthy diet and smoking. A similar tendency of clustering of unhealthy behaviours during
the COVID-19 pandemic was noted in a cohort of patients in Spain with type 2 diabetes
mellitus, who showed an increase in sugary foods and snack consumption alongside an
increase in sitting time, and a decrease in time spent walking or doing moderate physical
activity during lockdown when compared to beforehand.45 That detrimental health
behaviours might coincide in response to lockdown shows the importance of targeted
interventions for certain groups. Interestingly, alcohol consumption was seen to be a
protective factor in our cohort, and this does not tie with other findings on the negative
associations with increased alcohol use during the COVID-19 pandemic.46 This may be due
to the specific demographic features of our cohort, but the possibility of alcohol consumption
being associated with social interaction in this group cannot be excluded.
4.6

Limitations
This study has several limitations which may impact the generalisability of our

findings. First, the CCRR cohort appear more physically active than the general population.
90% of participants in CCRR achieved minimum UK 4 and WHO 3 guidance, both before and
following lockdown. Over 78% achieved double this amount, and mean levels of PA were at
least five times greater than the minimum recommendation. In contrast, only 61% of UK
adults aged 55-74 years achieve minimum recommended levels.2 Despite this, CCRR
participants may still not be active enough for major health gains. A 2016 systematic review

and meta-analysis suggested that optimal risk reduction for breast and colorectal cancer,
diabetes, ischaemic heart disease and stroke events were obtained from physical activity at
3000-4000 MET minutes per week.47
Second, there are differences in demography between the CCRR cohort and the general
population of the UK, which may explain the higher levels of PA we observed. 93% of CCRR
respondents identify as white/Caucasian ethnicity. The Active Lives Survey demonstrated a
difference in those achieving minimum activity levels in White British individuals (65%) and
those from Black (58%) and Asian (54%) ethnicities.2 Third, the CCRR survey relies on selfreport, using the short form IPAQ. IPAQ data is well validated across diverse participants up
to the age of 65 years

10

and a study of the performance of the IPAQ in older Japanese

adults demonstrated adequate validity.48 However, results from self-reporting tools for PA
only weakly correlate with those from objective measures, such as accelerometers and
pedometers.49–52 Finally, recall bias and seasonal changes in physical activity may also have
impacted on the results. The CCRR survey was collected in April-July 2020, with participants
asked to recall PA levels in the week before lockdown, which over time may become less
reliable. However, no significant differences were found in the mean PA levels reported
before lockdown according to month of survey completion and although there were apparent
differences in PA during lockdown by month, we were able to adjust for this in multivariable
models. The CCRR prospective cohort study is ongoing, with follow-up questionnaires sent
to participants at regular intervals. When complete this will allow for long-term impacts to be
measured, accounting for seasonal variation.
4.7

Conclusions
Findings from our CCRR study suggest a significant decline in average physical

activity levels in older adults following the introduction of lockdown measures during the
COVID-19 pandemic. Lower activity levels after lockdown were strongly linked to older age,
and to those with objective markers of social isolation, subjective feelings of loneliness and
symptoms of depression. Strategies and targeted interventions to increase and sustain PA
levels in older adults are needed to mitigate the adverse health impacts not only of COVID19 related lockdowns, but of social isolation in general, and should consider social
relationships in their design and implementation.

-Physical inactivity adversely affects older adults: almost two-thirds of adults over 75
years old are not sufficiently physically active for good health
-Social isolation and loneliness are associated with increased morbidity and mortality,
and decreased physical activity; lockdowns for Covid-19, although crucial, may
exacerbate this
What this study adds
-Physical activity decreased in older adults following implementation of lockdown
measures in the UK
-Those with factors suggesting increased social isolation, loneliness and depression
were particularly susceptible to lower levels of physical activity after lockdown
-Interventions designed to increase physical activity in older adults should take
account of social relationships in their design and implementation, and there is a
case for specific resources to help protect socially isolated individuals during
pandemic-related lockdowns
