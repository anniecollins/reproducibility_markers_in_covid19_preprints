Abstract

2

Background: SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing

3

remains the cornerstone of laboratory-based identification of patients with COVID-19. As the

4

availability and speed of SARS-CoV-2 testing platforms improve, results are increasingly relied

5

upon to inform critical decisions related to therapy, use of personal protective equipment, and

6

workforce readiness. However, early reports of RT-PCR test performance have left clinicians

7

and the public with concerns regarding the reliability of this predominant testing modality and

8

the interpretation of negative results. In this work, two independent research teams report the

9

frequency of discordant SARS-CoV-2 test results among initially negative, repeatedly tested

10

patients in regions of the United States with early community transmission and access to testing.

11

Methods: All patients at the University of Washington (UW) and Stanford Health Care

12

undergoing initial testing by nasopharyngeal (NP) swab between March 2nd and April 7th, 2020

13

were included. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR was performed targeting the N, RdRp, S, and E genes and

14

ORF1ab, using a combination of Emergency Use Authorization laboratory-developed tests and

15

commercial assays. Results through April 14th were extracted to allow for a complete 7-day

16

observation period and an additional day for reporting.

17

Results: A total of 23,126 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests (10,583 UW, 12,543 Stanford) were

18

performed in 20,912 eligible patients (8,977 UW, 11,935 Stanford) undergoing initial testing by

19

NP swab; 626 initially test-negative patients were re-tested within 7 days. Among this group,

20

repeat testing within 7 days yielded a positive result in 3.5% (4.3% UW, 2.8% Stanford) of

21

cases, suggesting an initial false negative RT-PCR result; the majority (96.5%) of patients with

22

an initial negative result who warranted reevaluation for any reason remained negative on all

23

subsequent tests performed within this window.

24

Conclusions: Two independent research teams report the similar finding that, among initially negative

25

patients subjected to repeat SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing, the occurrence of a newly positive result

26

within 7 days is uncommon. These observations suggest that false negative results at the time of initial

27

presentation do occur, but potentially at a lower frequency than is currently believed. Although it is not

28

possible to infer the clinical sensitivity of NP SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing using these data, they may

29

be used in combination with other reports to guide the use and interpretation of this common testing

30

modality.

Introduction

32

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the etiologic agent of coronavirus

33

disease 2019 (COVID-19). Accurate detection of the virus is essential to strategies endorsed by the

34

Centers for Disease Control and World Health Organization. As the availability and speed of SARS-CoV-

35

2 testing platforms improve, results of these tests are increasingly relied upon to inform critical decisions

36

related to therapeutic intervention, use of personal protective equipment, patient isolation, and workforce

37

readiness. While the analytic performance of SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase polymerase chain

38

reaction (RT-PCR) tests are well described[1], clinical performance is impacted by several factors that are

39

difficult to measure, such as low levels of shedding during incubation and early infection[2], variability in

40

the site of specimen acquisition[3,4], and sufficiency of sample collected. In addition, early reports and

41

characterizations in the press have left the medical community and general public with concerns about the

42

reliability of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing and the interpretation of negative results. Data characterizing

43

the scope of false negative results observed in the context of current US testing practices are needed to

44

guide clinical protocols and inform the public, but are lacking.

45
46

The initial US introduction of COVID-19 through Washington State[5] followed closely by Northern

47

California[6], combined with the early availability of SARS-CoV-2 testing in both regions[7,8], provides

48

an opportunity to evaluate clinical test performance in a population of repeatedly tested patients. In this

49

study, utilizing data from two independent healthcare systems and analyzed by separate research teams,

50

we report the frequency of discordant SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results among initially test-negative

51

individuals who were subsequently retested within 7 days.

Methods

54

Common Study Methods

55

All patients at both sites undergoing initial testing for COVID-19 by SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR of a

56

nasopharyngeal (NP) swab between March 2nd and April 7th, 2020 were included. Test results through

57

April 14th were extracted to allow for a complete 7-day observation period and an additional day for

58

result reporting. Data on cycle threshold (Ct) values were extracted for each test, and are interpreted as

59

inversely proportional to the viral load level present in the sample. Inconclusive RT-PCR test results (i.e.,

60

only 1 of 2 SARS-CoV-2 target genes amplified) were treated as positive in accordance with institutional

61

clinical guidelines.

62

63

UW Methods

64

The UW Virology clinical laboratory serves as the primary testing center for a broad region in the US

65

Pacific Northwest, processing over 60% of all SARS-CoV-2 tests for Washington State during the time

66

period examined. In order to ensure consistency of clinical data and compliance with patient privacy

67

policies, analysis was limited to adult patients having an established affiliation with UW Medicine.

68

Encounters spanning multiple facilities (e.g. outpatient, hospital, and drive-through testing locations)

69

were linked using an unambiguous identifier common to all sites. UW guidelines over the study period

70

for testing included the following: all patients who exhibited one or more symptoms of COVID-19 at the

71

time of initial testing per institutional protocol, which involved new symptoms of acute respiratory

72

infection (e.g., fever, cough, shortness of breath, myalgias, rhinorrhea, sore throat, anosmia, ageusia),

73

combined with pertinent risk factors (occupation, age, chronic disease status, immunosuppression, contact

74

with confirmed COVID-19 cases, pregnancy, housing stability, exposure to high-risk facilities or

75

inpatient admission) or based on clinical judgement; starting March 30th, 2020, universal pre-operative

76

screening for all asymptomatic surgical cases. Nasopharyngeal samples were collected according to

77

standard UW protocol (Supplement 1). UW testing platforms included a laboratory-developed test (LDT)

78

two-target/two-control assay modified from the CDC (target genes N1, N2) operating under a Washington

79

State emergency use authorization[7]; Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2 assay (Hologic, Marlborough, MA,

80

target genes two conserved regions of ORF1ab); Roche RT-PCR (Basel, Switzerland, target E gene);

81

DiaSorin (Saluggia, Italy, target ORF1ab and S genes). The University of Washington Institutional

82

Review Board determined this study to be exempt (STUDY00009931).

83

Stanford Methods

84

The Stanford Health Care (SHC) Clinical Virology Laboratory is based in northern California and

85

performed SARS-CoV-2 testing on both adult and pediatric populations. Approximately 2/3 of the

86

samples were from Stanford Medicine facilities and 1/3 were from medical facilities in northern

87

California with the greatest concentration coming from facilities in San Mateo and Santa Clara counties.

88

Testing was performed using one of two assays: 1) SHC Emergency Use Authorization LDT6 or 2)

89

Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2 assay. This study received approval by the Stanford Institutional Review

90

Board (Protocol #48973) and individual consent was not required.

91

Results

92

A total of 23,126 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests (10,583 UW, 12,543 Stanford) were performed in 20,912

93

eligible patients (8,977 UW, 11,935 Stanford) undergoing initial testing by NP swab between March 2nd

94

and April 7th, 2020. Initial results for 91% (90.7% UW, 91.2% Stanford) of patients were negative

95

(Figure 1A). Characteristics of initially negative patients are shown in Supplemental Table 1. The

96

majority of these patients (95.9% UW, 97.4% Stanford) did not undergo repeat testing within 7 days and

97

did not require subsequent evaluation in the form of outpatient, emergency department, or inpatient

98

encounters (Supplemental Table 1). Results of other viral respiratory tests were available for UW

99

patients and several negatively retested patients were ultimately diagnosed with other viral respiratory

100

illnesses, most commonly influenza A, rhinovirus, and RSV (Supplemental Table 1). However, a small

101

proportion (4.1% UW, 2.6% Stanford) underwent repeat testing within this window despite an initial

102

negative result (Figure 1A). Among those requiring reevaluation, 96.5% (95.9% UW, 97.2% Stanford)

103

remained negative on all repeat tests performed within 7 days.

104
105

It was observed that 3.5% (4.1% UW, 2.8% Stanford) of patients subjected to retesting on clinical

106

grounds within 7 days were subsequently found to be positive during this period, suggesting a false

107

negative initial result. The timing of clinical retesting and conversion among these patients is shown by

108

site in Figure 1B and Figure 1C, respectively. The clinical contexts and testing parameters of the 22

109

patients with discordant results are summarized in Supplemental Table 2. In this group, the mean

110

interval between initial negative test and first positive retest was 4.0 days (SD 2.0). RT-PCR cycle

111

threshold values of newly positive results averaged 28.5 (SD 8.0), consistent with lower viral RNA loads.

112
113

At UW, the use of standardized testing algorithms enabled subgroup analysis based on testing indication

114

(Figure 1A). A total of 299 asymptomatic individuals who were tested as part of universal screening for

115

preoperative clearance were excluded, leaving 7,846 symptomatic individuals who tested negative at the

116

time of initial presentation for analysis. Of the 302 individuals in this group with persistent or worsening

117

symptoms warranting additional testing within 7 days, 4.3% converted from negative to positive and

118

95.7% remained negative on all subsequent SARS-CoV-2 tests performed within this window.

119

Discussion

120

In this report, two independent research teams describe that, among patients initially testing negative by

121

SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR of a NP swab, repeat testing within 7 days yielded a positive result in 3.5% of

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.03.20089151; this version posted May 8, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

122

cases; the majority (96.5%) of those warranting additional testing for any reason remained negative on all

123

subsequent tests within this window. Among the subgroup of UW patients confirmed to have symptoms

124

prior to an initial negative result who were retested for persistent or worsening symptoms, a similar

125

proportion (4.3%) were subsequently found to be positive within 7 days. These observations suggest that

126

false negative NP SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results do occur, but potentially at a lower frequency than is

127

currently believed.

128
129

Results from each research group have limitations. Neither team is able to calculate a true clinical

130

sensitivity or false negative proportion due to the absence of retesting in all initially negative patients and

131

the lack of a gold standard confirmatory mechanism. Additionally, it cannot be ruled out that some

132

discordant test results in this cohort may be due to newly acquired infection. By limiting the scope of

133

retesting considered to a 7-day period, the likelihood of this scenario is minimized, but not eliminated.

134

Finally, we were unable to ascertain the disease status of the individuals who initially tested negative for

135

COVID-19 but did not undergo repeat testing; in most cases this likely reflects the absence of an

136

indication for retesting (e.g. alternative diagnosis or resolution of symptoms), but could also be the result

137

of limited access to care.

138

The intention of this report is not to definitively quantify the clinical performance of NP SARS-CoV-2

139

RT-PCR testing, which will likely require orthogonal approaches such as serology. Rather, by

140

characterizing the experience of two large US health systems on the short-term occurrence of newly

141

positive SARS-CoV-2 results among initially test-negative patients, we provide data on a topic of

142

practical significance that should be used in combination with other reports to guide the use and

143

interpretation of this common testing modality.
