Abstract
Background
Estimation of the fraction and contagiousness of undocumented novel coronavirus
(COVID-19) infections is critical for understanding the overall prevalence and
pandemic potential of this disease. Many mild infections are typically not reported
and, depending on their contagiousness, may support stealth transmission and the
spread of documented infection.
Methods
Here we use observations of reported infection and spread within China in
conjunction with mobility data, a networked dynamic metapopulation model and
Bayesian inference, to infer critical epidemiological characteristics associated with
the emerging coronavirus, including the fraction of undocumented infections and
their contagiousness.
Results
We estimate 86% of all infections were undocumented (95% CI: [82%-90%]) prior to
the
Wuhan
travel
(January
2020).

infections were 52% as contagious as documented infections ([44%-69%]) and were
the source of infection for two-thirds of documented cases. Our estimate of the
reproductive number (2.23; [1.77-3.00]) aligns with earlier findings; however, after
travel restrictions and control measures were imposed this number falls
considerably.
Conclusions
A majority of COVID-19 infections were undocumented prior to implementation of
control measures on January 23, and these undocumented infections substantially
contributed to virus transmission. These findings explain the rapid geographic spread
of COVID-19 and indicate containment of this virus will be particularly challenging.
Our findings also indicate that heightened awareness of the outbreak, increased use
of personal protective measures, and travel restriction have been associated with
reductions of the overall force of infection; however, it is unclear whether this
reduction will be sufficient to stem the virus spread.

The novel coronavirus that emerged in Wuhan, China (COVID-19) at the end of 2019
quickly spread to all Chinese provinces and, as of February 6, 2020, to 24 other
countries1,2. Efforts to contain the virus are ongoing; however, given the many
uncertainties regarding pathogen transmissibility and virulence, the effectiveness of
these efforts is unknown.
The fraction of undocumented but infectious cases is a critical epidemiological
characteristic that modulates the pandemic potential of an emergent respiratory
virus3−6. These undocumented infections often experience mild, limited or no
symptoms and hence go unrecognised, and, depending on their contagiousness and
numbers, can expose a far greater portion of the population to virus than would
otherwise occur. Here, to assess the full potential of COVID-19, we use a modelinference framework to estimate the contagiousness and proportion of
undocumented infections in China during the weeks before and after the shutdown of
travel in and out of Wuhan.
Methods
Metapopulation Model
We developed a mathematical model that simulates the spatio-temporal dynamics of
infections among 375 Chinese cities. The model incorporates information on human
movement within the following metapopulation structure:

where 𝑆< , 𝐸< , 𝐼<A , 𝐼<B and 𝑁< are the susceptible, exposed, documented infected,
undocumented infected and total population in city i. Note that we define patients
with symptoms severe enough to be confirmed as documented infected individuals;
whereas other infected persons are defined as undocumented infected individuals.
We specified a rate parameter, β, for the transmission rate due to documented
infected individuals. The transmission rate due to undocumented individuals is
reduced by a factor 𝜇. In addition, 𝛼 is the fraction of documented infections, Z is the
average latency period and D is the average duration of infection. The effective
reproduction number (𝑅4 ) is calculated as 𝑅4 = 𝛼𝛽𝐷 + (1 − 𝛼)𝜇𝛽𝐷 (see
Supplementary Appendix for details). Spatial coupling within the model is
represented by the daily number of people traveling from city j to city i (𝑀<3 ) and a
multiplicative factor, 𝜃, which is greater than 1 to reflect underreporting of human
movements (see below). We assume that individuals in the 𝐼<A group do not move

between cities. A similar metapopulation model has been used to forecast the spatial
transmission of influenza in the United States7.
Travel Data
Daily numbers of travelers between 375 Chinese cities during the Spring Festival
period (“Chunyun”) were derived from human mobility data collected by the Tencent
Location-based Service (LBS) during the 2018 Chunyun period (February 1 – March
12, 2018) 8. Chunyun is a period of 40 days – 15 days before and 25 days after the
Lunar New Year – during which there are high rates of travel within China. To
estimate human mobility during the 2020 Chunyun period, which began January 10,
we aligned the 2018 Tencent data based on relative timing to the Spring Festival.
For example, we used mobility data from February 1, 2018 to represent human
movement on January 10, 2020, as these days were similarly distant from the Lunar
New Year. During the 2018 Chunyun, a total of 1.73 billion travel events were
captured in the Tencent data; whereas 2.97 billions trips are reported8. To reconcile
these two numbers, we include the parameter 𝜃 in the model system.
Inference and Model Initialization
To infer COVID-19 transmission dynamics during the early stage of the outbreak, we
simulated observations from January 10-23, 2020 (i.e. the period before the initiation
of travel restrictions) using an iterated filter-ensemble adjustment Kalman filter (IFEAKF) framework9-11. With this combined model-inference system, we estimated the
trajectories of the four model state variables (𝑆< , 𝐸< , 𝐼<A , 𝐼<B ) for all 375 cities, while
simultaneously inferring the six model parameters (Z, D, 𝜇, 𝛽, 𝛼, 𝜃). The initial prior
ranges of the model parameters were drawn from uniform distributions of the
following ranges: 2 𝑑𝑎𝑦𝑠 ≤ 𝑍 ≤ 5 𝑑𝑎𝑦𝑠, 2 𝑑𝑎𝑦𝑠 ≤ 𝐷 ≤ 5 𝑑𝑎𝑦𝑠, 0.2 ≤ 𝜇 ≤ 1, 0.6 ≤ 𝛽 ≤
1.5, 0.02 ≤ 𝛼 ≤ 0.8, 1 ≤ 𝜃 ≤ 1.75.
For the outbreak origin, Wuhan city, the initial exposed population, 𝐸VBWXY , and initial
B
undocumented infected population, 𝐼VBWXY
, were drawn from a uniform distribution
A
[0, 𝑆𝑒𝑒𝑑\X] ]. The documented infected population in Wuhan 𝐼VBWXY
on January 10
was set to zero. Although infections were reported prior to January 10, these cases
were sporadic and the EAKF adjustment can account for the effects of these early
infections (by selecting elevated exposed and unreported infection levels). For other
cities, we defined 𝐶< as the number of travelers from Wuhan to city 𝑖 on the first day
of Chunyun. The initial exposed, documented infected and undocumented infected
B
populations were set to 𝐸< = 𝐶< 𝐸VBWXY /𝑁VBWXY , 𝐼<A = 0 and 𝐼<B = 𝐶< 𝐼VBWXY
/𝑁VBWXY .
To account for delays in infection confirmation, we also defined an observation
model using a Poisson process. Specifically, for each new case in group 𝐼<A , a
reporting delay 𝑡! (in days) was generated from a Poisson distribution with a mean
value of 𝑇! . In fitting both synthetic and the observed outbreaks, we performed
simulations with the model-inference system using different fixed values of 𝑇!
(4 𝑑𝑎𝑦𝑠 ≤ 𝑇! ≤ 12 𝑑𝑎𝑦𝑠) and 𝑆𝑒𝑒𝑑\X] (500 ≤ 𝑆𝑒𝑒𝑑\X] ≤ 6000). The best fitting
model-inference posterior was identified by log-likelihood. Full details of the data and
methods, including synthetic testing and sensitivity analyses, are provided in the
Supplementary Appendix.

Modelling epidemic dynamics after January 23
Finally, we also modelled the transmission of COVID-19 in China after January 23,
when greater control measures were effected. These control measures included
travel restrictions imposed between major cities and Wuhan; self-quarantine and
contact precautions advocated by the government; and more available rapid testing
for infection confirmation12-13. These measures along with changes in medical careseeking behaviour due to increased awareness of the virus and increased personal
protective behavior (e.g. wearing of facemasks, social distancing, self-isolation when
sick), likely altered the epidemiological characteristics of the outbreak after January
23. To quantify these differences, we re-estimated the system parameters using the
metapopulation model-inference framework and city-level daily cases reported
between January 24 and February 8. As inter-city mobility was restricted, we set 𝜃 =
0. In addition, to represent reduced person-to-person contact and increased infection
detection, we updated the initial priors for 𝛽 and 𝛼 to [0.2, 1.0] and [0.2, 1.0],
respectively (see Supplementary Appendix for more details).
Results
Epidemiological Characteristics before January 23, 2020
We first tested the model-inference framework using synthetic outbreaks generated
by the model in free simulation. These simulations verified the ability of the modelinference framework to simultaneously estimate the six target model parameters
(see Supplementary Appendix, Figures S1-S8).
We next applied the system to the observed outbreak before the travel restrictions of
January 23 – a total of 811 documented cases throughout China. Figure 1 shows
simulations of reported cases generated using the best-fitting model parameter
estimates. The distribution of these stochastic simulations captures the range of
observed cases well. In addition, the best-fitting model captures the spread of
COVID-19 to other cities in China (Figure S9). Our median estimate of the overall 𝑅4
is 2.23 (95% CI: 1.77−3.00), indicating a high capacity for sustained transmission of
COVID-19 (Table 1). This finding aligns with other recent estimates of the
reproductive number for this time period6,12-14. In addition, the median estimates for
the latent and infectious periods are approximately 3.77 and 3.45 days, respectively.
Further, we find that, during January 10-23, only 14% (95% CI: 9–26%) of total
infections in China were reported. This estimate reveals a very high rate of
undocumented infections: 86%. This finding is independently corroborated by the
infection rate among foreign nationals evacuated from Wuhan (see Supplementary
Appendix). These undocumented infections are estimated to have been half as
contagious per individual as reported infections (µ = 0.52; 95% CI: 0.44 – 0.69).
Other model fittings made using alternate values of 𝑇! and 𝑆𝑒𝑒𝑑\X] produced similar
parameter estimates (Figure S10).
The Impact of Undocumented Infections during January 10-23
Using the best-fitting model (Table 1, Figure 1), we estimated 18,829 (95% CI
[3,761, 38,808]) total new COVID-19 infections (documented and undocumented
combined) during January 10-23 in Wuhan city. 86.3% of all infections (95% CI

[81.9%, 90.1%]) were infected from undocumented cases. Nationwide, the total
number of infections during January 10-23 was 28,898 (95% CI [5,534, 59,491]) with
86.4% (95% CI [82.0%, 90.1%]) infected from undocumented cases.
To highlight further this impact of contagious, undocumented COVID-19 infections on
overall transmission and reported case counts, we generated a set of hypothetical
outbreaks using the best-fitting parameter estimates but with 𝜇 = 0, i.e. the
undocumented infections are no longer contagious (Figure 2). We find that without
transmission from undocumented cases, reported infections during January 10-23
are reduced 66.4% across all of China and 64.0% in Wuhan. Further, there are fewer
cities with more than 8 cumulative documented cases: only 1 city with more than 8
documented cases versus the 10 observed by January 23 (Figure 2). This finding
indicates that contagious, undocumented infections facilitated the geographic spread
of COVID-19 within China.
Epidemiological Characteristics after January 23, 2020
The results of inference for the January 24-February 8 period are presented in Table
2, Figure S11 and Table S1. Control measures are continually shifting, so we show
estimates for both January 24 – February 3 (Period 1) and January 24 – February 8
(Period 2). The best-fitting model for both periods has a reduced reporting
delay, 𝑇! , of 5 days (vs. 10 days before January 23), consistent with more rapid
confirmation of infections. Estimates of both the latency and infectious periods are
relatively unchanged; however, 𝛼, 𝛽 and 𝑅4 have all shifted considerably. The
contact rate, 𝛽, drops to 0.51 (95% CI: 0.39 – 0.69) during Period 1 and 0.34 (95%
CI: 0.27 – 0.48) during Period 2, less than half the estimate prior to travel
restrictions. The reporting rate, 𝛼, is estimated to be 0.71 (95% CI: 0.55 – 0.85), i.e.
71% of infections are documented during Period 1, up from 0.14 prior to travel
restrictions, and is nearly the same in Period 2. The reproductive number is 1.51
(95% CI: 1.17 – 2.10) during Period 1 and 1.00 (95% CI: 0.73 – 1.38) during Period
2, down from 2.23 prior to travel restrictions. While the estimate for the relative
transmission rate, 𝜇, is similar to before January 23, the contagiousness of
undocumented infections, represented by 𝜇𝛽, is substantially reduced, possibly
reflecting that only very mild and asymptomatic infections remain undocumented.
Discussion
Our findings indicate that a large proportion of COVID-19 infections were
undocumented prior to the implementation of travel restrictions and other heightened
control measures in China on January 23, and that a large proportion of the total
force of infection was mediated through these undocumented infections (Table 1).
This high proportion of undocumented infections, many of whom were likely not
severely symptomatic, appears to have supported the rapid spread of the virus
throughout China. Indeed, suppression of the infectiousness of these undocumented
cases in model simulations reduces the total number of documented cases and the
overall spread of COVID-19 (Figure 2).
Our findings also indicate that a radical increase in the identification and isolation of
currently undocumented infections would be needed to fully control COVID-19.

Increased news coverage and awareness of the virus in the general population have
already likely prompted increased rates of seeking medical care for respiratory
symptoms. In addition, awareness among healthcare providers, public health officials
and the availability of viral identification assays suggest that capacity for identifying
previously missed infections has increased. Further, general population and
government response efforts have increased the use of face masks, restricted travel,
delayed school reopening and isolated suspected persons, all of which could
additionally slow the spread of COVID-19.
Combined, these measures are expected to increase reporting rates, reduce the
proportion of undocumented infections, and decrease the growth and spread of
infection. Indeed, estimation of the epidemiological characteristics of the outbreak
after January 23, indicate that government control efforts and population awareness
have reduced the rate of spread of the virus (i.e. lower 𝛽, 𝜇𝛽, 𝑅4 ) and increased the
reporting rate. The overall reduction of the effective reproductive number is
encouraging; however, the control efforts have yet to critically and clearly reduce 𝑅4
below 1.
Importantly, the situation on the ground in China is changing day-to-day. New travel
restrictions and control measures are being imposed on new populations in different
cities, and these rapidly varying effects make certain estimation of the
epidemiological characteristics for the outbreak difficult. Further, reporting
inaccuracies and changing care-seeking behavior add another level of uncertainty to
our estimations. While the data and findings presented here indicate that travel
restrictions and control measures have reduced COVID-19 transmission
considerably, whether these controls are sufficient for reducing 𝑅4 below 1 for the
length of time needed to eliminate the disease locally and prevent a rebound
outbreak once control measures are relaxed is unclear. Further, similar control
measures and travel restrictions would have to be implemented outside China to
prevent re-introduction of the virus.
Our findings underscore the seriousness and pandemic potential of COVID-19. The
2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza virus also caused many mild cases, quickly spread
globally, and eventually became endemic. Presently, there are four, endemic,
coronavirus strains currently circulating in human populations (229E, HKU1, NL63,
OC43). If the novel coronavirus follows the pattern of 2009 H1N1 pandemic
influenza, it will also spread globally and become a fifth endemic coronavirus within
the human population.
Many characteristics of the COVID-19 remain unknown or uncertain. Consequently,
care should be taken when interpreting our estimates. For instance, after January
23, we assume a complete travel shutdown with no inter-city human mobility;
however, the degree and initial date of travel restrictions has varied among cities.
Our estimates may therefore represent an upper-bound of the potential impact of
travel restriction on COVID-19 transmission. Further studies accounting for
heterogenous travel interventions are warranted.

Figures

Fig. 1. Best-fit model-inference fitting (𝑆𝑒𝑒𝑑\X] = 5000, 𝑇! = 10 days) to daily reported
cases in all cities (A), Wuhan city (B) and Hubei province (C). The blue box and whiskers
show the median, interquartial range, and 95% credible intervals are derived from 300
simulations using the best-fit parameters. The red ‘x’s are daily reported cases. The
distribution of estimated 𝑅4 is shown in (D).

Fig. 2. Impact of undocumented infections on the transmission of COVID-19.
Synthetic outbreaks generated using parameters reported in Table 1 are compared
for 𝜇 = 0.52 (red) and 𝜇 = 0 (blue).
