Abstract
Background—Patients with the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have
different degrees of psychological pain, such as anxiety and depression, which may
related to their prognosis. Psychological intervention can be conducted in different
ways to improve psychological pain and improve the treatment effect.
Objective—The present study aimed to investigate and analyze the psychological
status of patients with COVID-19 during the course of illness, and to evaluate the
effect and influencing factors of psychological crisis intervention, so as to explore the
effective mode of clinical psychological intervention in acute patients under isolation
environment.
Methods—A total of 143 persons participated in the study, including 26 patients
diagnosed with COVID-19 in the isolation ward (COVID-19 group), 87 patients with
general pneumonia in the observation ward (General Pneumonia group) and 30
healthy volunteers (Normal group). All the patients in the ward received
comprehensive psychological intervention, including telephone psychological
counseling (active and passive), self-adjustment of written materials and one-to-one
psychological crisis intervention. Hamilton depression scale (HAMD) and Hamilton
anxiety scale (HAMA) were used to evaluate the mental health status of all patients
on the day of admission and 1 week after treatment.
Results—The scores of HAMA and HAMD of all patients (including isolation ward
and observation ward) were significantly higher than the healthy volunteers at the
time of admission. The total score of HAMA and HAMD in CVOID-19 group were
both higher than that General Pneumonia group. After 1 week`s hospitalization with
comprehensive psychological intervention, the scores of HAMA and HAMD in
CVOID-19 group were significantly decreased.
Conclusion—Patients those who diagnosed with COVID-19 in the isolation ward
and/or general pneumonia in observation ward have different degrees of anxiety,
depression and sleep problems. While receiving antiviral treatment, patients also need
psychological intervention. Comprehensive psychological intervention model has
been proved to be effective.

INTRODUCTION
The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a new type of respiratory
infections, since December, 2019, in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, which has
spread rapidly throughout the country, and has now spread to the global infectious
diseases, this is strong, high-rise close contact with the outbreak of the epidemic. A
few cases were serious or even fatal [1-3]. The rapid spread of the disease in a wide
range of vulnerable to varying degrees of panic, not conducive to the disease for
treatment and rehabilitation. Ningbo First hospital as a designated hospitals for
COVID-19 admitted that the disease medical care for patients in a timely and
effective psychological intervention is also an important task. As pneumonia patients
need strict isolation, medical staff need to strictly guard, combined with mobile
phones, networks, and the establishment of the psychological advisory group[4], a
phone, text, video and one-to-one online psychological intervention and so on, in
order to explore the hospital confirmed and suspected new corona virus in the disease
process, the patient's psychological changes, as well as psychological intervention
effectiveness.

MATERIAL AND METHODS
Participants and study design
Collection 2020 February 5 to February 29 in view of the patient wards,
including a total of 143 cases of 26 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 (COVID-19
group), who are in line with the interim guide diagnostic standards and national
defense construction committee of the novel coronavirus pneumonia clinical trial
program (version 6), diagnostic criteria, and nasopharyngeal swab specimen by
Nucleic Acid Detection tests positive, of which 9 were men (35 per cent), 17 were
women (65 per cent), and the age up to 86 years of age, minimum age of 27 years old,
average age 56, mostly elderly patients. General Pneumonia group: 119 patients with
general pneumonia met the diagnostic criteria of pneumonia, but the Nucleic Acid
Detection test of the pharyngeal swab was negative, and 32 patients with general
pneumonia were excluded due to unwillingness to participate or other reasons can`t
complete the study (including hearing impairment, speech impairment).
There are 114 patients (COVID-19 group n=26 and General Pneumonia group
n=87) with comprehensive psychosocial interventions, including telephone
counselling (active and passive), written materials self-adjustment and one-to-one
psychological crisis intervention. Normal Group: As the age and sex of the patient to
match the healthy volunteers, a total of 30, of which 10 were male (33%), 20 (67%),
with an average age of 52 years.
This study was approved by the Ethical Committee of Ningbo First Hospital
(approval number: 2020-R042) and registered with the registry website
http://www.chictr.org (registration number: ChiCTR2000030697). All participants
in this study signed informed consent was obtained.
The route of present study as shown in the figure1.

Data and Instruments
Participants provided their sociodemographic information and clinical illness
histories and completed several measures of psychosocial functioning at study
baseline. Using the Hamilton depression scale (24) (A HAMD-24) and Hamilton
anxiety gauge (HAMA) assess all patients and healthy cases and integrated
psychological intervention, including telephone counselling (active and passive),
written materials self-adjustment and one-to-one psychological intervention. After 1
week, the diagnosis for all coronavirus pneumonia patient re-evaluated.
The main statistical indicators of HAMD-24 score and HAMA total score,
HAMD-24 total score is less than 8 points and there is no depression, 8-20 points may
have depression, 20-35 points certainly depression, 35 points or more severe
depression; HAMA total score is less than 7 points without anxiety, 7-14 points may
have anxiety, 14-21 points certainly anxiety, 21-29 points must be a clear anxiety, 29
points or more serious anxiety.
Statistical analysis
Statistical survey database established by using social science software SPSS19.0,
and statistical analysis, by analysis of variance for multiple samples of mean
difference comparison, by t test for paired samples of mean differences, p < 0.05 for
the difference was statistically significant.

RESULTS
Analysis of psychological state with coronavirus pneumonia on admission
The scores of HAMA and HAMD-24 in patients with COVID-19 and general
pneumonia were significantly higher than the healthy volunteers at the time of
admission. The results as shown in table 1.
The effects of psychological intervention on COVID-19 patients.
At the time of admission, the anxiety and depression of patients with COVID-19
was obviously. Through 1-week hospitalization with psychological intervention and
daily telephone contact for supportive psychological intervention, the scores of
HAMA and HAMD-24 in CVOID-19 group were significantly decreased. As shown
in figure 2.

DISCUSSION
The main findings of the present study were that HAMA total score of
hospitalized patients were generally high. That is common in hospitalized patients
with varying degrees of psychological problems, especially have a higher level of
anxiety and somatization symptoms[4], suggesting that patients not only bear the
severe physical pain, and mental distress, especially the COVID-19 patients with
anxiety depression is more common in patients with general pneumonia, consider the
reason has the following several aspects: 1. From the perspective of the route of
transmission of COVID-19, mainly for the close contact and the spread of respiratory

tract, the infectious, many for family gathering, patients not only concerned about
their illness, more concerned about the infection of members of the family; 2. From
the perspective of COVID-19, the new virus had never found in the human body,
because of Wuhan viral pneumonia cases were found in 2019, was named the world
health organization (WHO) on January 12, 2020, so the people the knowledge of the
new disease, less about the characteristics of the virus and disease diagnosis,
treatment and prognosis are exploring, so the uncertainty is adding to the patients with
tension and fear of disease; 3. In a short period of time, a large number of COVID-19
patients broke out, the news media continuously reported, the death of some patients,
all make the patients' psychological bearing capacity is low, in the course of illness is
prone to depression, or even negative ideas. Therefore, in the process of disease
treatment, patients not only need medical treatment, but also need psychological
support. It is worth noting that in the process of receiving the intervention, a small
number of patients began to reject the psychological intervention and deny the
psychological problems. After our patient and careful explanation and communication,
they finally accepted our help, which also reflected that our medical staff needed to
take the initiative to publicize and provide help to more patients.
COVID-19 is a strong contagious acute respiratory disease, the course of
development is fast, the symptom such as patients with high fever, difficulty
breathing[1-3,5], there is no specific medicine, treatment is more suit the support is
given priority to, appear easily in patients with anxiety and panic, and hospitalization
after strict isolation environment cannot receive relatives and friends of emotional
support, message block, prone to pessimism and despair, often have a lot of
psychological pressure, was in a state of crisis, the urgent need for psychological
support and intervention. But as a result of the new virus infectivity, mainly for the
droplet and contact transmission in close communication, the traditional face-to-face
psychological crisis intervention, on the one hand, easy to cause disease is on the
other hand also increases medical supplies such as isolation of a large number of
consumption, are more likely to cause cross infection, and telephone psychological
crisis intervention is effective to avoid the spread of the virus, but also has better
timeliness. Our daily morning patients by phone or radio link, understand the patients
psychological condition at present, the problems existing in the process of its life or
treatment timely communication and solve, stable patients with their own emotions,
and disease education, more positive information feedback to the patient, strengthen
the positive emotions, increase treatment adherence, cooperate to ward treatment,
prevent impulse to run, self-injury, hurt, such as abnormal behavior, adverse effects
on individuals, families and society.
This study has some limitations, as a result of the new champions league
pneumonia in patients with less sample size, research results have representative need
to further expand the study sample size, and the patient's isolation and protection of
medical personnel to carry out psychological intervention also caused a certain limit,
psychological treatment in addition to the speech communication face to face, and
even more expressions and gestures, and medical personnel's body language also have
obvious effect on patients with stable mood, such as watching a nod, take back, thumb,

V gestures, etc., can better close distance, make patients feel be respected and valued,
psychological assessment and psychological intervention on the patients better,
promote disease rehabilitation. In addition, the psychological intervention without
using case-control study, it is difficult to eliminate the effects of disease rehabilitation
of mental state at the same time the author also noted that the COVID-19 outbreak is
long-term and far-reaching impact on patients, as the patients' rehabilitation home
may appear new problems such as post-traumatic stress disorder, at present the related
content need further follow-up, relevant data also in the collecting and organizing of
further, we will further complete the next stage.

CONCLUSIONS
Understanding the psychological state of patients with pneumonia, especially
patients with COVID-19, can help clinicians to systematically identify patients
vulnerable to psychological pain, and provide targeted psychosocial interventions to
improve the mental health of patients.
