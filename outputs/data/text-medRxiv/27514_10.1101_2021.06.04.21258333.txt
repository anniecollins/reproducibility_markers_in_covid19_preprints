Abstract
In early 2021, the SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 became dominant across large parts of the world.
In Denmark, comprehensive and real-time test, contact-tracing, and sequencing efforts were
applied to sustain epidemic control. Here, we use these data to investigate the transmissibility,
introduction, and onward transmission of B.1.1.7 in Denmark. In a period with stable restrictions,
we estimated an increased B.1.1.7 transmissibility of 58% (95% CI: [56%,60%]) relative to other
lineages. Epidemiological and phylogenetic analyses revealed that 37% of B.1.1.7 cases were
related to the initial introduction in November 2020. Continuous introductions contributed
substantially to case numbers, highlighting the benefit of balanced travel restrictions and selfisolation procedures coupled with comprehensive surveillance efforts, to sustain epidemic control
in the face of emerging variants.

A year into the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic it became clear that variants with increased
transmissibility and/or reduced vaccine efficacy would have a profound impact on our lives,
including prolongation of the pandemic as well as increasing morbidity and mortality. On 14
December 2020, Denmark received a notification from the Early Warning and Response System
of the European Union (EWRS) about a novel SARS-CoV-2 lineage (B.1.1.7) spreading fast
throughout the United Kingdom (UK). The notification was a direct response to genomic
sequences uploaded to the GISAID database by the Danish Covid-19 Genome Consortium
(DCGC). On 18 December 2020, the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory
Group (NERVTAG), advisers to the British Health Authorities, released a public statement,
reporting a 71% (95% CI: [67%,75%]) increased transmissibility for the B.1.1.7 lineage and
elevated it to variant-of-concern (VOC) (1). The B.1.1.7 lineage appeared in the UK in September
2020 and has since spread across the world (2), including Denmark where the first identified case
was sampled on 14 November 2020 (3). Several studies have since estimated an increased
transmissibility of B.1.1.7, ranging from 29% to 90% (4–7). This is in line with early estimates of
36%-55% from Denmark (8, 9). Hypotheses for increased transmissibility include higher viral
load, longer infection period, and better receptor binding (10–12).
The B.1.1.7 lineage contains several genetic changes compared to the specimens first
identified in Wuhan, China. Most notably is the spike protein amino acid substitution N501Y
which enhances binding to the ACE2 receptor and is thought to increase transmissibility (12).
Acquired mutations can be used to construct the phylogenetic relationship between genomes and
by coupling with temporal information, transmission timing and dynamics of emerging lineages
can be inferred (13). These approaches have been used by several studies to gain insights into the
SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on a national level (6, 7, 14–17).
Due to the early warning from the UK and an already extensive sequencing effort in
Denmark, it was possible to predict growth dynamics for B.1.1.7 in Denmark, when it was still
less than 2% of all circulating SARS-CoV-2 lineages. Hence, on 2 January 2021, B.1.1.7 was
predicted to exceed 50% relative abundance nationwide in the middle of February (3, 18), which
formed a key argument in the political decision to further extend the lockdown at the time and
intensify contact tracing on all B.1.1.7 cases (19). In this study we substantiate early results by
providing an updated estimate of increased transmissibility of B.1.1.7. Furthermore, using the
detailed and comprehensive nationwide data, we outline the dynamics of B.1.1.7 in Denmark to
evaluate the impact of introductions and regional restrictions on the prevalence and spread of
B.1.1.7.
We modelled the growth rate of B.1.1.7 relative to other lineages in the period from 4
January to 7 February 2021. The study period was chosen as both the PCR testing and sequencing
capacity increased substantially until January, reaching a weekly rate of >13,000 tests pr. 100,000
people and >75% of all positive samples having a high-quality genome (fig. 1A, fig. S1).
Furthermore, a window with stable restrictions was enforced from January 4th until partial
reopening of primary schools from February 8th. A Poisson regression model was fitted on daily
counts of B.1.1.7 to estimate increased transmissibility of B.1.1.7 relative to all other lineages. We
found a growth rate of 0.021 and -0.062 per day for B.1.1.7 and other lineages respectively,
corresponding to an increased transmissibility of 58% (95% CI: [56%,60%]) for B.1.1.7 assuming
a generation time of 5.5 days (10, 20). We did not observe significant differences in transmissibility

between regions (𝜒𝜒(4)
= 3.17, 𝑝𝑝 = 0.54).
After the study period ended, case numbers of B.1.1.7 in South Denmark and Capital
increased to higher levels than what was predicted by our model (fig. S2A), likely caused by large
superspreading events, evident from the rapid increase of unique local haplotypes in South

Denmark (H17 and H87) and Capital (H43) regions (fig. S2B). All regions crossed 50% relative
abundance of B.1.1.7 with a few days difference (fig. 1B), except North Denmark, with 1-2 weeks
delay and several incidences of B.1.1.7 decline (fig. 1B).
Introductions into Denmark and onward transmission between regions were investigated
using a time-scaled phylogenetic tree of 1976 Danish B.1.1.7 genomes and 3611 representative
international sequences from outside Denmark (fig 2A). We used pastML (21) to perform an
ancestral state reconstruction, to infer if sequences were introduced from outside Denmark or
transmitted from another Danish region. We define an introduction lineage as a phylogenetic group
of Danish sequences that share the same introduction event, similar to the definition of UK
transmission lineages in (15). We do not infer the timing of introduction events from the phylogeny
(7, 15, 22), but instead use the first occurrence of an introduction lineage as a proxy justified by
the intense testing and high sequencing rate (fig. S1). An introduction lineage can be further
subdivided into transmission clusters from the ancestral state reconstruction, which is based on the
regional and temporal sub-distributions of an introduction lineage. The inferred connections
between transmission clusters outlines the direction of transmission between regions. The first
cases of B.1.1.7 observed in the Capital region of Denmark on 14 November 2020 defines the
introduction lineage CA1, which contained the majority of Danish sequences (736 of 1976, 37%)
across all Danish regions (fig. 2B, fig. S3). We tried to resolve the origin of CA1, but detailed
epidemiological investigations revealed no direct or indirect travel link and the ancestral state
could not be resolved with good confidence. The CA1 introduction lineage is associated with the
first reported cases of B.1.1.7 in all Danish regions, including the first North Denmark transmission
cluster CA1-135. This transmission cluster was part of a large but local outbreak verified by
epidemiological investigations and primarily associated with a single local superspreading event
(haplotype H77, fig. S2B). CA1-135 dominated the North Denmark cases until it was last observed
in week 2 (fig. 2B). This contrasts the course of the first transmission clusters in other regions,
which showed similar initial growth (CA1-108 in South Denmark and CA1-124 in Zealand) but
remained at high prevalence throughout the study period.
Interestingly, all transmission clusters appearing up until week 1 in North Denmark were
not observed in the remaining study period, which were not true for other regions where a constant
level of sustained transmission was present for many larger transmission clusters (fig. 3A). In
North Denmark, 7 of 11 municipalities had elevated restrictive measures until 16 November 2020
due to circulation of mink-related lineages (23). The intensified contact-tracing and genomic
surveillance in that period likely kept the reproductive numbers for North Denmark below that of
other Danish regions, making it difficult for any cluster to develop from local to sustained
transmission. B.1.1.7 was only designated as VOC from late December 2020 onwards (1) and
authorities were not able to do sufficient genome-based contact tracing due to low number of
samples sequenced (around 25% of positive cases) and slow turnaround (median 11 days) at that
time. Therefore, the dynamics in North Denmark is likely not attributed to focused contact tracing
of B.1.1.7. This contrasts the current situation in June 2021, with substantially improved
sequencing capacity (>90% of positive cases and median 5 days turnaround) and rapid mutation
of concern screening to initiate contact tracing (24, 25).
Overall, we identified 103 introductions and 107 transmission events between regions of
B.1.1.7 in the study period (fig. 3). The majority of introductions occurred during the first half of
January 2021 (fig. 3B); 37 introductions showed no onward transmission, 36 introductions had
between 2-5 cases of whom 8 exclusively had transmission within the same household, and only
5 caused >100 cases. To investigate the impact of introductions across time we considered early
cases of the same introduction lineage to be introduction-related, while later cases occur due to
sustained transmission in society. To evaluate this, we incremented the number of follow-up days

for cases to be assigned as introduction-related (fig. 3C). Overall, the relative contribution of
introduction-related cases peaked during onset of B.1.1.7 and again in mid-January (fig. 3C).
Introductions alone (follow-up =0 days in fig. 3C) accounted for around 5%-10% of all cases with
substantial temporal variation. This is comparable to a US study on data from the first half of 2020,
where travel restrictions also applied (22). Using 14 days follow-up since the first occurrence of
an introduction to define introduction-related cases within the same introduction lineage, there
were periods where >50% of cases were due to importation from outside Denmark (fig. 3C) despite
travel-restrictions and self-isolation recommendations being in place.
In collaboration with the Danish Patient Safety Authority which administers the contact
tracing efforts in Denmark, we performed detailed epidemiological investigations of registry data
to identify direct or indirect travel links for all 1976 cases in this study. A total of 62 persons
infected with B.1.1.7 (3%) had recorded travel history to 23 different destinations. The most
frequent destinations were the United Arab Emirates (n = 21), United Kingdom (n = 5), and
Pakistan (n = 4). We were able to associate 32 (31%) introductions directly to travelling (fig. 3A,
fig. S5). We performed a separate ancestral state reconstruction with country-level resolution on
international sequences, allowing us to compare the phylogenetically inferred origin to the travel
history. Of 33 introductions with travel history, 9 (27%) matched by country and 12 (36%) by
high-level geographical region. This highlights the limitations of available genomic data, which is
still heavily biased both geographically and temporally (26), making high-resolution inference of
introduction origin from phylogenetic data alone very difficult. From the ancestral state
reconstruction, we inferred the temporal dynamics of B.1.1.7 dispersion between the five major
administrative regions of Denmark. The majority of transmission was local and occurred within
regions, but would to a large extent cease if not fueled by introductions from other regions or
outside Denmark (fig. 3D). The Capital and South Denmark regions with international borders and
substantial international travel-activity also received the most introductions, possibly a combined
effect of multiple factors such as leisure travel and commuting for work. Interestingly, the Capital
region also had the highest number of outgoing transmissions to other regions, acting as an
important source for sustaining B.1.1.7 in Denmark, particularly in the Zealand region which has
a large number of residents commuting to the Capital region on a regular basis. In many countries
the takeover of B.1.1.7 has prolonged or induced further restrictions to sustain epidemic control.
In Denmark, genomic surveillance has been key to rapidly predict growth of B.1.1.7, leading to
enforced restrictions in effect from 5 January 2021 when B.1.1.7 was still below 2% relative
abundance of all SARS-CoV-2 variants (27). The enforced restrictions practically eliminated all
other circulating variants within 2 months (fig. 1B) and enabled epidemic control to be maintained
as society was gradually reopened from 8 February 2021. We validated the initially predicted
increased transmissibility of B.1.1.7 and found that superspreading events, identified through
sequencing data, could explain deviations from the model (fig. S2). At the time when B.1.1.7 was
recognized as VOC, the initial CA1 introduction lineage had expanded considerably across all
regions, which substantially accelerated the initial phase of the B.1.1.7 pandemic in Denmark.
However, ongoing introductions and regional transmissions continuously fueled and further
accelerated growth of this lineage. Since 22 December 2020, authorities enforced elevated
restrictions for travelers from the UK to halt B.1.1.7 expansion (19), similar to the restrictions
enforced for inbound travelers from Italy and Austria in the spring of 2020 to stop SARS-CoV-2
from spreading to Denmark (28). Despite these restrictions, our study shows a substantial impact
of introductions, suggesting that country-specific restrictions and non-enforced recommendations
of self-isolation might be insufficient. Finally, VOC designation of B.1.1.7 and upscaling of
capacity in Denmark was too late to hinder the takeover of this lineage, which had to be managed
by broad societal restrictions. However, real-time testing, genomic tracking and contact-tracing is

policy makers to make informed decisions of opening the society while maintaining control of the
epidemic in the face of emerging variants.

Data and materials availability
This study was conducted on administrative register data. According to Danish law, informed
consent is not needed for such research as the publication only contains aggregated results and no
personal data is shown. The epidemiological data used in this work is person-sensitive and we are
prohibited to make it publicly available according to Danish legislation. SARS-CoV-2 consensus
genome sequences associated with this work have been uploaded to the GISAID database in
accordance with Danish law (no. 285 vers. 2021-02-27). As consequence, dates are binned by
week and maximum spatial resolution is at regional level. Accession numbers are available in the
Supplementary Materials (data file S1). All code used to run the phylogenetic analysis, Poisson
regression models, and generate the visualizations used in this work is available at

Fig. 1. Sequencing rate and lineage dynamics. Each row corresponds to the region highlighted
to the far left. The two vertical dashed lines indicate the beginning and end of study period used to
infer B.1.1.7 transmissibility, while the non-shaded area shows the period used for phylogenetic
analysis. The time outside the study are shaded in grey. (A) sequencing rate across time. Total
height corresponds to the total number of cases for each week. Green bars indicate the number of
cases for which a high-quality genome was available (less than 3000 ambiguous bases). (B)
relative abundance of ten most abundant PANGO lineages across Denmark in the study period.
Computed from rolling averages of daily cases with genome available over a 14-days window.
Less abundant lineages are not shown but included in the unfilled area of the plots. The black dot
and date corresponds to the point where B.1.1.7 crosses 50% relative abundance.

Fig. 2. Early introduction of B.1.1.7 and onwards transmission between Danish regions. (A)
time-adjusted phylogenetic tree. Tree branches and non-Danish sequences are coloured grey. First
sequence in a transmission lineage is used to infer time of importation and highlighted with a black
circle. (B) and (C) shows a focused temporal analysis of the CA1 introduction lineage, focusing
on descending clusters with more than 5 cases. (B) the temporal span and dynamics of onwards
transmission across regions. Each descendent transmission cluster of CA1 is indicated with a solid
horizontal line, with points at each week sized according to the number of cases. The vertical
curved arrows indicate direction of transmission. The marginal probability of the observed
transmission link is indicated at each arrow. In (C) the corresponding cases are placed on a map
of Denmark using black points, with up to 5 km of random jitter added. Cases from the same
transmission cluster are linked by black lines to their centroid location indicated by a red dot.
Labels indicate cluster id’s.

Fig. 3. Analysis of importation events into Denmark and onwards transmission between
regions. (A) the temporal span and development of each transmission cluster, grouped by Danish
region. Each transmission cluster is indicated with a solid horizontal line, with points at each week
sized according to the number of cases. Circles indicate first observed case of an introduction
lineage imported from outside Denmark. Red points indicate presence of cases with travel history
in the given week. (B) the number of introductions into Denmark across time. Colours indicate the
total number of offspring cases associated with each introduction lineage. (C) the relative
contribution of introductions versus ongoing existing transmission. Introduction-releated cases
were defined with various cutoffs for the maximum number of days between the case and the first
observed case for each introduction lineage, as indicated by different colours. (D) the origin of
introductions across time for each region. If there was equal support for multiple regions as origin
for an introduction Denmark was used as the origin. Label notDK indicates an introduction from
outside Denmark. Only ancestral state changes with a marginal probability >95% were included
in the analysis.
