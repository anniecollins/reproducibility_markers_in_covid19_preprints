ABSTRACT
Background
SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests have undergone a remarkable improvement in
performance. However, due to the low seroprevalence in several areas, very high
demands are made on their specificity. Furthermore, the low antibody-response in some
individuals requires high test sensitivity to avoid underestimating true seroprevalence.
Optimization of testing has been reported through lowering manufacturer cut-offs to
improve SARS-CoV-2 assay sensitivity or by combining two tests to improve specificity
at the cost of sensitivity. However, these strategies have thus far been used in isolation
of each other.

Methods
To increase sensitivity, cut-offs of three commercially available SARS-CoV-2 automated
assays (Roche, Abbott, and DiaSorin) were reduced according to published values in a
pre-pandemic specificity cohort (n=1117) and a SARS-CoV-2 positive cohort (n=64). All
three testing systems were combined in an orthogonal approach with a confirmatory
test, which was one of the remaining automated assays or one of two commercial
ELISAs directed against the spike protein receptor binding-domain (RBD) or the
nucleocapsid antigen (NP).

Results
The modified orthogonal test strategy resulted in an improved specificity of at least
99.8%, often even 100%, in all 12 tested combinations with no significant decline in
sensitivity. In our cohort, regardless of whether the assays were used for screening or
confirmation, combining Roche and Abbott delivered the best overall performance
(+~10% sensitivity compared to the single tests and 100% specificity).

Conclusion
Here we propose a novel orthogonal assay strategy that approaches 100% specificity
while maintaining or even significantly improving the screening test's sensitivity.

Introduction
Serological tests detecting SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies became available shortly
after the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Over the last few months, SARS-CoV-2
serology has experienced incredible diversity and technical development. Only weeks
after the first ELISA protocol for SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing had been made publicly
available (1), several fully automated serologic tests received emergency-use
authorization by the FDA (2).
It should be noted that these tests can perform very different diagnostically, which has
been described in detail recently (3-15). Due to the continuing overall low
seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 (16), the need for highly specific (≥99.5%) test systems
to provide adequate positive predictive values has become evident (17). Additionally,
contrary to the manufacturers' data and the first publications on this subject, the test
systems have not proven sufficiently sensitive (4-6, 11, 18, 19). This discrepancy could
be explained because the COVID-19 positive cohorts in the validation studies were
mainly hospitalized patients and not cases with mild to moderate or even asymptomatic
disease (20). However, there is increasing evidence that, especially in non-hospitalized
cases with RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, very low levels of specific
antibodies can be observed frequently (21-24). Inadequate antibody responses can
eventually lead to a negative result when the manufacturers' cut-offs are applied,
resulting in suboptimal sensitivities of the test systems.
Recently, an increasing number of publications have suggested two-test algorithms for
SARS-CoV-2 serology (11, 15, 19, 25, 26). However, standard two-test algorithms aim
to increase specificity, not sensitivity. This strategy is already used in the serodiagnosis

of other infectious diseases and was recently also recommended by U.S. national public
health officials to overcome the specificity issue. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, falsepositive samples are usually not simultaneously reactive in different test systems (4, 15).
Thus, an orthogonal test approach, in which positive results are confirmed with another
test, can maximize specificity by excluding false-positive results.
The disadvantage of this test strategy, which was recently shown in a study for the
SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests from Abbott, Roche, and DiaSorin (19), is that the gain in
specificity usually comes at the expense of sensitivity and therefore increases the
number of false negatives of individual tests. Thus, depending on the seroprevalence,
undesired changes from over- to underestimating the actual number of SARS-CoV-2
seropositive samples may occur. To overcome this limitation, a fundamentally modified
orthogonal test strategy was necessary: by maximally reducing the cut-offs of the
individual tests, sensitivity was markedly increased, and consequently reduced
specificity was compensated by orthogonal testing.
In the present work, we show for the first time an orthogonal test algorithm based on
real-life data for the SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests of Roche, Abbott, DiaSorin, and two
commercial SARS-CoV-2 ELISAs modified according to Krammer et al. (27) intending to
maximize both specificity and sensitivity at the same time.

Methods
Study design and patient cohorts
Samples used in this non-blinded prospective cross-sectional study were either left-over
materials from the diagnostic process (N=13) or derived from the MedUni Wien Biobank,
a facility specialized in the preservation and storage of human biomaterial, which
operates within a certified quality management system (ISO 9001:2015) (28).
As described before (4), samples from collections established before 01.01.2020 were
used as a specificity cohort: a cross-section of the Viennese population, LEAD study
(29), pre-selected for samples collected between November and April to enrich for
seasonal infections (n=494); a collection of healthy voluntary donors (n= 265); a
disease-specific collection of samples from patients with rheumatic diseases (n=358).
The SARS-CoV-2 positive cohort (n=64 samples from n=64 individuals) consisted of
samples from 38 convalescent donors from the MedUni Wien Biobank (29 were PCRconfirmed cases, 9 were close contacts of them), 19 PCR-confirmed in- or outpatients of
the General Hospital Vienna and seven convalescent plasma donors from the
Department of Blood Group Serology and Transfusion Medicine. Of the overall cohort,
42 presented with mild to moderate symptoms, 4 reported severe symptoms, 13 were
admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), and 5 donors were asymptomatic. Symptom
onset to analysis time was determined by a questionnaire in convalescent donors and by
reviewing individual health records in patients. For asymptomatic donors (n=5), SARSCoV-2 RT-PCR confirmation to analysis time was used instead. A detailed description of
all cohorts was published previously (4). All included participants gave written informed
consent to donate their samples for scientific purposes. From patients, only left-over

material from diagnostic procedures was used. The overall evaluation plan conformed
with the Declaration of Helsinki as well as relevant regulatory requirements. It was
reviewed and approved by the ethics committee of the Medical University of Vienna
(1424/2020).

Antibody testing
SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies were either measured according to the manufacturers'
instructions on three different automated platforms (Roche, Abbott, DiaSorin) or using
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) manufactured according to the test
established by the Krammer Lab (30) (Technoclone Technozym® RBD and
Technozym® NP) at the Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of
Vienna.
In brief, the Roche Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay detects total antibodies against
the nucleocapsid (NC) antigen in a sandwich electrochemiluminescence immunoassay
(ECLIA) on a cobas® e801 analyzer (Roche Diagnostics, Rotkreuz, Switzerland).
According to the manufacturer, results exceeding 1.000 COI are considered positive.
The Abbott SARS-CoV-2 assay detects IgG-antibodies against NC in a
chemiluminescence microparticle assay (CMIA) on Abbott ARCHITECT® i2000sr
platforms (Abbott Laboratories, Chicago, USA). The cut-off suggested by the
manufacturer is 1.40 index (S/C). The DiaSorin LIAISON® SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG test
detects IgG-antibodies against the S1/S2 domains of the virus' spike protein on
LIAISON® XL analyzers (DiaSorin S.p.A., Saluggia, Italy) employing
chemiluminescence immunoassays (CLIA). Results >12.0 AU/mL are considered

positive (the manufacturer suggests retesting of borderline results between 12.0 – 15.0
AU/mL; however, this approach is not practicable when using historical samples).
Commercially available ELISAs based on the protocols developed in the Krammer Lab
(27) are directed against the nucleoprotein (NP) (Technozym® anti SARS-CoV-2 NP
IgG) or the RBD (Technozym® anti SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgG) domain of the spike protein
(Technoclone, Vienna, Austria). Calibrators and controls of both tests are traceable to a
specific antibody against the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (CR3022). These
quantitative assays were processed manually according to the manufacturer's
instructions. IgG-antibodies were quantified on a Filtermax F5 plate reader (Molecular
Devices, San José, USA). The reduced cut-offs for these assays were modeled in-house
and set at 4000 U/ml (data not shown).

Statistics
Orthogonal testing algorithm
Potential orthogonal testing approaches were identified by a combination of a screening
test performed on an automated platform (Roche, Abbott, or DiaSorin) and a
confirmation test, which could be one of the remaining automated assays or an ELISA
test (Technozym® NP or Technozym® RBD) that can be easily performed without
additional large-scale equipment. As suggested in the literature, the cut-off levels for
Roche, Abbott, and DiaSorin were reduced to increase sensitivities (3, 10, 31). Values
above the higher cut-off (i.e., no false positives above this range) were considered
positive without additional confirmation tests. All results that fell between the lower cutoff value and the higher cut-off value were retested with one of the confirmation tests
(Figure 1).

Unless otherwise indicated, categorical data were given as counts (percentages), and
continuous data were presented as median (interquartile range). 95% Confidence
Intervals (CI) for sensitivities and specificities were calculated according to Wilson, 95%
CI for predictive values were computed according to Mercaldo-Wald unless otherwise
indicated. Sensitivities and specificities were compared by z-score testing. All
calculations were performed using Analyse-it 5.66 (Analyse-it Software, Leeds, UK).

Results
Conventional orthogonal testing with manufacturers' cut-offs
Using the cut-offs as suggested by the manufacturers in conventional orthogonal test
settings (i.e., confirmation of positives by a second, confirmatory test system), a
specificity of about 100% (99.9-100%) was obtained for all tested combinations. The
sensitivities, on the other hand, reached at most the initial value of the screening test
used, but usually decreased significantly (range 70.3 [58.2-80.2] – 84.4 [73.6-91.3])
depending on the confirmatory test used (Supplemental Table 1). Interestingly, for the
Roche test, no significant further improvement in specificity could be achieved by
orthogonal testing using the cut-offs suggested by the manufacturers, as the initial
specificity was already close to 100%. On the other hand, it significantly lost sensitivity in
3 out of 4 tested combinations. Furthermore, of all tested combinations, only the
retesting of Abbott results by Roche achieved a statistically significant improvement in
specificity while maintaining the screening test's initial sensitivity. In the next step, we
aimed to increase sensitivities by lowering the cut-offs for positivity.

Increasing sensitivity of automated SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays by reducing the cut-offs
As suggested in the literature, cut-offs for positivity of automated SARS-CoV-2 antibody
assays were lowered to >0.165 COI (Roche) (31), ≥0.55 index (Abbott) (10), and >9.0
AU/mL (DiaSorin) (3), see also Figure 1. As a result, 6 additional samples were correctly
identified as positive for Roche, 8 for Abbott, and 4 for DiaSorin (Figure 2 and
Supplemental Table 2). Hence, sensitivity increased significantly for all automated
assays: Roche +9.4%, Abbott +12.5%, and DiaSorin +6.3% (Table 1). In contrast, the
increase in false positives (Roche +15, Abbott +18, and DiaSorin +11) significantly

reduced the specificity of the tests: Roche -1.3%, Abbott -1.6%, DiaSorin -1.0% (Table
1). This loss of specificity caused consistently low positive predictive values at a
presumed seroprevalence of 2% (39.6-55.5%). IgG based assays showed strikingly
isolated overlaps in false-positive samples: Abbott had one false positive specimen in
common with DiaSorin and two matching samples each with the RBD and NP ELISA;
DiaSorin shared one more sample with the RBD ELISA. Interestingly, there was no such
overlay of false-positive results in the Roche assay with any of the four IgG-based
assays tested (Figure 2 and Supplemental Table 2). In the next step, we aimed to
restore specificity by an orthogonal testing approach.

Recovery of specificity by an adaptive orthogonal testing approach
All specimens with results between the reduced cut-offs derived from the literature and
the high cut-offs (where false positives were no longer expected) in the screening assay
were retested with a second method (see retesting range in Figure 2). Of the total 1181
specimens (1117 pre-COVID and 64 post-COVID samples, 5.4% positivity rate), 27
(2.3%) were retested for Roche, 45 (3.8%) for Abbott and 87 (7.4%) for DiaSorin.
The Roche Elecsys® total antibody assay could be combined with all remaining tests to
reach a specificity of 100.0% (99.7-100.0), with no false positives left. However, this
increase in specificity was not statistically significant compared to the single test
approach using the manufacturer's cut-offs, as the initial specificity was already
comparably high (99.7%). Simultaneously, sensitivities remained significantly increased
when combined with the Abbott, the DiaSorin, and the Technozym® RBD assay (all
p<0.05).

The Abbott Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG test, in contrast, reached 100.0% specificity only
when followed by the Roche assay; in the other combinations, it remained slightly below,
as a few false-positives persisted (99.8-99.9%). Pairing the Abbott with the Roche assay
or the Technozym® RBD ELISA also raised the sensitivity significantly (p<0.01).
The specificity of the DiaSorin LIAISON Anti-Sars-CoV-2 IgG assay could be
significantly improved (99.9-100.0%) when all samples with results >9.0 AU/mL were
retested with any of the remaining assays. However, in all combinations except for that
with the Roche assay (p<0.05), sensitivity returned to previous levels, but did not further
decrease, as it was the case when applying a conventional orthogonal testing algorithm
using the manufacturers’ cut-offs (results of all combinations are displayed in Table 2).

Selection of the ideal test combination
Orthogonal testing with reduced cut-offs resulted in improved specificity (between 99.8
and 100% specificity) in any of the 12 combinations tested. The greatest increase in
specificity was achieved for the DiaSorin assay (from 98.2% to 99.9 or 100%). Besides,
when the Roche assay was used as the primary test, all combinations except with the
NP ELISA showed a statistically significant gain in sensitivity (from 89.1% to 95.3% or
96.9%). The Roche assay yielded the highest sensitivity increases when used as a
confirmatory test (from 84.4% to 96.9% for Abbott and 82.9% to 88.9% for DiaSorin). In
our test cohort, Roche and Abbott's combination led to the best overall performance, no
matter whether Roche or Abbott was used as a screening or confirmatory test
(specificity 100% and sensitivity 96.9%). The second-best solution was achieved using
Roche as screening and RBD ELISA or DiaSorin as a confirmatory test (specificity 100%

Discussion
The detection of specific antibodies can confirm a previous infection with SARS-CoV-2,
even if the infection was not diagnosed by PCR or was asymptomatic in the first place.
For this reason, serological SARS-CoV-2 testing is the method of choice for estimating
the prevalence of previously infected persons and closing the gap between PCR
confirmed cases and unreported cases (17). Due to the very variable, but globally still
low seroprevalence rates for SARS-CoV-2 (16), high demands are placed on the
specificity of the antibody assays (Supplemental Figure 1). Many commercially available
SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests do not provide sufficient specificity to achieve acceptable
positive predictive values (PPVs), for example at a seroprevalence rate of 1-5% (4, 11).
So far there have been three different approaches to solve the problem of specificity:
a) the use of assays with very high specificity (>99.5%);
b) to increase the pre-testing probability by pre-selecting high-risk populations;
c) the use of conventional orthogonal testing, whereby initial positive results are
confirmed by a second method to exclude false positives.
There are indeed already some highly specific assays (14), but their application might
not be possible everywhere due to regional differences in availability or lack of technical
equipment. This solution, therefore, cannot be implemented in every case. Preselection
of populations could lead to a biased picture of the overall situation in seroprevalence
studies. A conventional orthogonal test strategy can undoubtedly increase the specificity
massively and even bring it very close to 100%, but a decisive disadvantage can arise
as recent publications have shown: i.e., a significant loss of sensitivity (19, 26). We

could previously show that the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests can drop below
90%, especially when non-hospitalized patients are included (4). In the meantime,
suboptimal sensitivities of SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests have been described in
numerous subsequent publications (4, 7, 12, 32). Thus, an orthogonal test strategy with
a certain further loss of sensitivity does not seem appropriate for seroprevalence
studies, especially considering the dynamic development of infection rates we are
facing. A-priori estimates of the expected prevalence could therefore be misleading. If
we experience a shift from low prevalence to high prevalence due to the overall trend of
infections or regional clustering ("hot spots"), adequate sensitivity is just as important as
adequate specificity of the test system used.
Based on real data related to SARS-CoV-2, which are in principle generalizable for all
types of serological tests, we, therefore, propose a entirely new test strategy and thus a
fourth approach to solve the problem:
The combination of improved sensitivity through cut-off modeling and an orthogonal test
strategy to restore specificity. This algorithm offers the opportunity to significantly
improve the overall performance of SARS CoV-2 antibody tests.
For this purpose, the recommended manufacturer cut-offs were reduced according to
the results of other independent studies (3, 10, 31). These reduced cut-offs to increase
sensitivity are close to the modeled Youden indices, and indeed, although described in
completely independent studies, they can obviously be applied to our study collective.
Therefore, we anticipate that certain generalizability can be assumed in this context and
that cut-offs for other test systems can be modeled in a similar way based on the
Youden indices. All 12 combinations tested in the present study (3 screening tests with 4

different confirmatory tests each) achieved specificities of 99.8%-100.0%. Consequently,
a significant increase in specificity was achieved for Abbott, and a massive increase in
specificity was seen for DiaSorin, due to the very moderate initial specificity of 98.2%.
For DiaSorin, this means a doubling of the PPV at an assumed seroprevalence of 2%.
In contrast to a classical orthogonal test approach (19, 26), no statistically significant
decrease in sensitivity below the screening test's initial level was detected in any
combination tested. However, the combinations Roche + RBD ELISA or Abbott or
DiaSorin, as well as Abbott + RBD ELISA or Roche or DiaSorin, and DiaSorin + Roche
showed significant increases in sensitivity. In this context, it should be noted that the
maximum achievable sensitivity in the orthogonal test approach depends very much on
the sensitivity performance of the screening assay. In our study, the Roche test clearly
outperformed the DiaSorin test with a substantial difference in initial sensitivity, and
reduced cut-offs of the Roche test, allowing for a wider range of inclusion of additional
positives. All additional potential false-positives were ruled out by the confirmation tests.
We propose a novel orthogonal test strategy for SARS-CoV-2 serology (but generally
applicable to serological testing), which makes it possible to maintain or even
significantly improve sensitivity while approaching 100% specificity.
