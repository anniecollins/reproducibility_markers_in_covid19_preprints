Summary
Background SARS-CoV-2 is a novel human coronavirus, there is no specific antiviral
drugs. It has been proved that host-cell-expressed CD147 could bind spike protein of
SARS-CoV-2 and involve in host cell invasion. Antibody against CD147 could block
the infection of SARS-CoV-2. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of
meplazumab, a humanized anti-CD147 antibody, as add-on therapy in patients with
COVID-19 pneumonia.
Methods All patients received recommended strategy from Chinese Clinical Guidance
for COVID-19 Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatments released by National Health
Commission of China. Eligible patients were add-on administered 10 mg meplazumab
intravenously at days 1, 2, and 5. Patients hospitalized in the same period were observed
as concurrent control. The endpoints include virological clearance rate, case severity,
chest radiographic, and laboratory test. This trial was approved by the Ethics
Committee of Institution at the Tangdu hospital, and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,
NCT 04275245.
Findings 17 patients were enrolled and assigned to meplazumab group between Feb 3,
2020 and Feb 10, 2020. 11 hospitalized patients served as concurrent control. Baseline
characteristics were generally balanced across two groups. Compared to control group,
meplazumab treatment significantly improved the discharged (p=0.005) and case
severity (p=0.021) in patients. The time to virus negative in meplazumab group was
reduced than that in control group (median 3, 95%CI[1.5-4.5] vs. 13, [6.5-19.5];
p=0.045, HR=0.374, 95%CI[0.143-0.978]). The percentages of patients recovered to
the normal lymphocyte count and CRP concentration were also increased remarkably
and rapidly in meplazumab group. No adverse effect was found in meplazumab-treated
patients.
Interpretation Meplazumab efficiently improved the recovery of patients with SARSCoV-2 pneumonia with a favorable safety profile. Our results support to carry out a
large-scale investigation of meplazumab as a treatment for COVID-19 pneumonia.

Introduction
Coronavirus is an enveloped positive stranded RNA virus belonging to the family
Cornonaviridae, order Nidovirales.1 Over the past 20 years, two human coronaviruses,
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were reported to lead to severe and fatal lower respiratory
tract infection.2,3 In Dec 2019, an outbreak of a respiratory syndrome, COVID-19, was
detected in China which is caused by a novel coronavirus, named SARS-CoV-2.4 The
genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 shows it belongs to betacoronavirus genus, and has
extremely high homology with SARS-CoV at genome and proteome.5,6
Illness onset among rapidly increasing numbers of COVID-19 in China and globe
indicates that SARS-CoV-2 is more contagious than both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
The infection of SARS-CoV-2 leads to acute viral exudative pneumonia, with multiple
organ damages, especially in lung, presenting bilateral diffuse alveolar damage with
cellular fibromyxoid exudates.7 80% cases have mild symptoms (including nonpneumonia and mild pneumonia cases), while about 20% patients have developed
severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, which attribute to death.8
As of Mar 12th, 2020, 125,048 cases and 4,613 death have been reported globally.9
The current standard treatment including oxygen therapy, antiviral treatment, fluid
management, and antimicrobial therapy for secondary bacterial infections.10 Although
several drugs, such as remdesivir and chloroquine phosphate, have been registered in
ongoing clinical trials for COVID-19, no specific antiviral drugs against this novel
coronavirus are approved so far. The latest report indicates the infection of SARS-CoV2 increases the expression levels of multiple proinflammatory cytokines, including
IFN-γ, TNF-α, MCP1, and IL-6 in the serum, which suggests the inflammation storm
may involve in the progression of COVID-19.4 Therefore, inhibiting virus replication
and limiting excessive inflammation are of equal importance in COVID-19 therapy.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the only reported host cellular
receptor for SARS-CoV-2 to our knowledge,11 which presents in various human tissues,
including alveolar epithelial cells, endothelial cells of arteries and veins, smooth muscle
cells, etc.12 Our current published data showed a direct interaction between spike
protein of SARS-CoV-2 and CD147, a type I transmembrane glycoprotein expressed
on epithelial cells. A humanized IgG2 monoclonal antibody against CD147,
meplazumab, effectively inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication and virus-induced
cytopathic effect in Vero E6 cells, both in a dose-dependent manner. These data
demonstrated a novel entry of virus infection mediated by CD147 receptor.13
CD147 is also presented in activated inflammatory cells and participates the
regulation of cytokine secretion and leukocytes chemotaxis by binding with cyclophilin
A (CyPA).14,15 CyPA is a proinflammatory cytokine that is up-regulated in response to
virus infection.16 Our previous studies demonstrated that antibody targeting CD147
inhibited CyPA-induced T cell chemotaxis thus attenuating the local inflammation.17
Based on these evidences, we assess the clinical outcomes using meplazumab as
add-on therapy in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. We designed an open-label,
concurrent controlled trial to evaluate whether meplazumab infusion improves the
patients with COVID-19 pneumonia by inhibiting virus replication and suppressing
inflammation. We hope our study will shed light on finding a new drug and strategy to

control this novel coronavirus-induced pneumonia.
Methods
Study design and patients
We did a prospective, single center, open-labelled trial at Tangdu Hospital of
Fourth Military Medical University in Xi'an, China. The study protocol and consent
were approved by the Independent Ethics Committee of Institution for National Drug
Clinical Trials at the Tangdu hospital (K202002-01). The study was registered at
ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04275245), before any patient enrollment.
Enrolled patients fulfilled inclusion and exclusion criteria. The inclusion criteria
are as follows: men and women aged 18 to 78 years; patients with common, severe, or
critical COVID-19 pneumonia were laboratory and clinical diagnosed according to
Chinese Clinical Guidance for COVID-19 Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatments
released by National Health Commission of China;18 the subjects must understand the
study and be willing to participate in the study. The exclusion criteria are as follows:
allergic reactions or a history of allergy to any of the ingredients treated in this trial;
patients not suitable to participate in this study by the judgment of the investigator. Each
patient signed an informed consent form before enrollment.
Case severity of COVID-19 is categorized as common, severe, and critical by the
vital signs, oxygenation index (PaO2/FiO2), chest radiographic, and vital organ function
based on the Diagnosis and Treatment for 2019 Novel Coronavirus Disease.18 Common
case was featured by fever, respiratory symptoms, and radiographic pneumonia. Severe
case was characterized by any of the following signs: dyspnea, respiratory frequency
≥30/minute, blood oxygen saturation ≤93%, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio <300mmHg. Critical
case was characterized by any of the following signs: respiratory failure needing
mechanical ventilation, shock, and multiple organ dysfunction/failure needing
Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The patients who met all the following criteria will be
discharged: body temperature recovered and remained normal more than 3 days;
respiratory symptoms relief, and two continuous negative for nasopharyngeal swab test
for SARS-CoV-2 (interval more than 24 hours).
In same period, hospitalized patients in the same center were observed as
concurrent control, and were required to follow the inclusion and exclusion criteria
mentioned above.
Procedure
Any enrolled patients received recommended treatment according to the
Diagnosis and Treatment for 2019 Novel Coronavirus Diseases.18 Physicians were
allowed to use any necessary treatment, laboratory, and radiographic examination with
their standard of care. Clinical, laboratory, and radiographic assessments were
conducted at baseline, including complete blood count, serum biochemical test (renal
function, liver function, and C reactive protein (CRP)), serum electrolytes test,
coagulation analysis (PT, APTT, INR, FIB, D-Dimer), chest CT/chest X-ray,
nasopharyngeal swab test for SARS-CoV-2 (using qRT-PCR assay approved by the
National Medical Products Administration).

There were 18 study visits from baseline to day 28. 10mg meplazumab was
administered on day 1, day 2 and day 5 by intravenous infusion within 60-90 min.
Efficacy and safety were assessed at baseline, every day after day 1 to day 14, and every
week thereafter up to day 28 or discharge.
Outcomes
The primary study endpoint was the virological clearance (i.e. negative
conservation rate and time to negative) using qRT-PCR in nasopharyngeal swabs
samples. Secondary efficacy endpoints were assessment of time to recovery of vital
sign (including body temperature, respiratory rate, and SPO2), chest radiographic
improvement, rate of PaO2/FiO2 recovery, time (days) to discharge, and inflammation
recovery (percentage of patient with normal CRP concentration).
Statistical analysis
Continuous variables were expressed as median (IQR) and compared with the
Mann-Whitney U test. Categorical variables were expressed as number (%) and
compared by Fisher's exact test, Ordinal regression, or McNemar's test. 100% stacked
column were drawn to describe composition of case severity, chest radiographic
improvement, lymphocyte count, and CRP concentration. Differences between
discharged and virus nucleic acid negative conversion curves were analyzed by Cox
regression analysis, and multiple cox regression was also used to take account of
potential confounding variables including group, age, case severity, and glucocorticoid
treatment. A two-sided α of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS software, version 23.0 and
GraphPad Prism software, version 5.0.
Role of the funding source
The funder of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis,
data interpretation, or writing of the report. The corresponding authors had full access
to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for
publication.
Results
Between Feb 3, 2020, and Feb 10, 2020, we screened 39 patients diagnosed with
COVID-19 in Tangdu Hospital. The reasons for screen failure are listed in figure 1. 17
patients signed informed consent and were allocated to meplazumab group. 11
hospitalized patients who met the inclusion criteria and with no exclusion criteria signs
were collected as concurrent control in the same period. Demographics, comorbidity,
epidemiological exposure, prescribed treatment, signs & symptoms, and case severity
were generally balanced across two groups as shown in table 1. The median age of
patients was 51 years (IQR 49-67) in meplazumab group and was 64 years (IQR 43-67)
in control group. Patients in both groups had epidemiological exposure history.
Underlying comorbidity, including diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and
Parkinson disease, were observed in 52.9% and 36.4% patients in meplazumab and

control groups, respectively. All patients had received recommended therapy according
to the Diagnosis and Treatment for 2019 Novel Coronavirus Diseases,18 including
antiviral treatment, glucocorticoid treatment, and antibiotic treatment. 4 common cases,
6 severe cases, and 7 critical cases were enrolled in meplazumab group. In contrast, 4
common cases, 4 severe cases, and 3 critical cases were collected in control group,
showing no difference compared to meplazumab group (p=0.688). Subsequently, 11
patients had received 3 doses meplazumab, and 6 patients had received 2 doses
meplazumab.
The distribution of case severity and discharged cases was analyzed in each group
over 28 days follow-up as shown in table 2. The overall improvement rates (defined as
the percentage of discharged or improved cases) at days 7, 14, 21, 28 were 17.6% (3/17),
47.1% (8/17), 82.4% (14/17), and 94.1% (16/17) in the meplazumab group, while those
were 0% (0/11), 27.3% (3/11), 54.5% (6/11), and 81.8% (9/11) in the control group,
respectively. One aggravating case was observed in control group at day 7. At the end
of observation (day 28), both groups showed significant improvement compared to
baseline (p<0.001 for both meplazumab and control).
To observe the efficacy of meplazumab add-on therapy, we analyzed the time to
discharge using multiple Cox regression analysis. As shown in figure 2A, the
meplazumab treatment significantly improved the discharged of cases (p = 0.005)
compare to control cohort.
Recovery in severe and critical cases is of paramount importance to reduce
mortality of COVID-19. The case severity of severe and critical cases in both groups
were improved significantly compared to baseline, since 7 days post-treatment (figure
2B). At day 28, 4 severe cases and 1 critical case were improved to common and no
case was discharged in control group. In meplazumab group, 9 cases (6 severe and 3
critical) were discharged, 2 critical cases were improved to common, and 1 critical case
was improved to severe, demonstrating a significantly beneficial outcome compared to
control group (p=0.021, table 2 and figure 2B). These results indicated that meplazumab
treatment accelerated the improvement and make a rapid recovery from COVID-19
pneumonia, especially for the severe and critical cases. In this trial, no death was
reported in all patients.
Chest radiographic analysis was performed independently by two radiologists, and
graded by the changed areas of ground-glass opacity and consolidation compared with
the baseline. As shown in figure 3, the chest radiographic, compared to baseline in both
two groups, were improved gradually over 28 days. At day 7, in the meplazumab group,
1 case (5.9%, 1/17) improved more than 50%, and 7 cases (41.2%, 7/17) improved 2550%, while no patients improved over 25% in control group. At day 14, 47.1% patients
(8/17) in meplazumab group improved more than 50%, and no similar situation was
observed in control group. At day 21, 12 case (70.6%, 12/17) improved more than 50%,
and 3 cases (17.6%, 3/17) improved 25-50% in meplazumab group, while 3 case (27.3%,
3/11) improved more than 50%, and 5 cases (45.5%, 5/11) improved 25-50% in control
group. The meplazumab group showed more significant benefit than control group in
days 7, 14, and 21 (p=0.010, p=0.006, and p=0.037, respectively), which coincident
with the improvement of case severity. A representative chest CT image of

meplazumab-treated patient was shown in figure 4, which displayed the CT imaging
manifestations (bilateral ground-glass shadow and consolidation) of COVID-19 at
baseline period, and all these lesions were resolved at 22 days post-treatment.
In this trial, the clearance of virus has been evaluated by negative-conversion rate
and the time to negative. At day 7, the rate of virus nucleic acid negative conversion in
control group was 27.3% (3/11), and reached to 54.4% (6/11) at day 14. While, the rate
was 76.5% (13/17) in meplazumab group at day 7, and reached to 94.1% (16/17) at day
14, which were significantly higher than control group (p=0.019 and p=0.022,
respectively). The analysis of time to virus negative indicated that meplazumab-treated
patients converted to negative in a shorter period than patients in control group
significantly (median 3, 95%CI[1.5-4.5] vs. 13, [6.5-19.5]; p=0.045, HR=0.374,
95%CI[0.143-0.978], figure 5). The results of multiple Cox regression indicate that no
baseline characteristics, including age (p = 0.092), glucocorticoid treatment (p = 0.339),
and case severity (p = 0.455) contributed to the difference of time to virus negative. All
these data indicate an obvious benefit of meplazumab treatment in the clearance of
SARS-CoV-2.
It was reported that lymphocytopenia is a typical characteristics and correlated
with the prognosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. In our study, we compared the
lymphocyte count between baseline and post-treatment in both groups. As shown in
figure 6A, in observation period (day 7 to 28), the percentages of patients with a normal
lymphocyte count (>0.8×109/L) were increased in both groups, while the improvement
in meplazumab group was more notable. Compared to baseline, the percentage in
meplazumab group was improved significantly as early as day 7 (p=0.031), but no
significance difference was detected in control group over the follow-up period.
We also measured the concentration of CRP, as a predictors of COVID-19
severity.19 As shown in figure 6B, from day 3 to day 28, the percentages of patients with
a normal CRP concentration (≤5mg/L) were increased from 52.9% (9/17) to 82.4%
(14/17), indicating significant increases compared to baseline (all p<0.05 at days 3, 7,
14, 21, and 28). In control group, the significant increases were observed at day 14, and
day 21 compared to baseline. The data suggests that meplazumab exhibited an effect
on the control of virus-induced acute inflammation at early management.
In meplazumab group, the elevation of both ALT and AST (≥ 2 ULN ) was reported
in 2 patients (2/17, 11.8%). In control group, both ALT and AST elevations were
reported in 1 case (9.1%), and single ALT elevation was reported in 1 case (9.1%). The
increased level of ALT and AST returned to normal after 7 days in all four patients, and
the treatment procedure was not affected by their fluctuation. The abnormal
transaminase was not related with meplazumab treatment after comprehensive
judgement by the investigators. No other adverse event was reported in meplazumabtreated patients, including reaction around the injection site, rash, nausea, vomit,
anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, total bilirubin, albumin and creatinine etc.
Discussion
With the rapid escalation of the COVID-19, over 120 countries have reported more
than 140,000 cases in the world. As of Mar 8, 2020, 73 clinical trials have been

registered in Clinicaltrial.gov, in which nearly one fifth reagents are small molecular
compounds, such as remdesivir and oseltamivir, and four are antibody drugs like PD-1
blocking antibody, bevacizumab, eculizumab, and meplazumab.20 Here, we reported an
add-on trial, using anti-CD147 humanized monoclonal antibody, meplazumab, with a
novel pharmacological mechanism to treat COVID-19 pneumonia by blocking virus
invasion and attenuating inflammation. The adding meplazumab 20-30 mg in patients
with COVID-19 who have received recommended treatment,18 increased the
virological clearance rate, promoted the recovery of chest radiographic and
lymphocytopenia, decreased the inflammation index (CRP), accelerating the
improvement of disease without serious adverse event.
In our recent published study, we have revealed that CD147 is a novel identified
receptor for SARS-CoV-2 infection by binding with spike protein. SARS-CoV-2
infection was efficiently inhibited by meplazumab targeting CD147 in a dose dependent
manner. All these results provide insights that CD147 acts as a functional entry receptor
for SARS-CoV-2, and serves as a therapeutic target for inhibiting virus infection.13
It was reported 18.5% cases in COVID-19 were categorized as severe and critical
cases, and fatality rate for critical case was 49.0% to 61.5%.4,8 These studies reveal the
great challenge of enhancing the therapeutic effects for severe case of COVID-19, and
focus on how to conduct effective intervention as early as possible. In this add-on trial,
we introduced a novel therapy target to block the virus infection and inflammation, with
a favorable efficacy. Meplazumab treatment accelerated the improvement of COVID19, especially in the severe and critical cases. At the day 28, 69.2% severe and critical
cases were discharged, and no death case was reported. The improvement of chest
imaging, clearance of virus, and recovering of lymphocyte count, were observed within
1 week management, which indicated that the therapeutic effects facilitated prognosis.
CD147 is a receptor for ligand CyPA, and its interaction with CD147 was key to
the inflammation and chemotaxis.21 CyPA is secreted to extracellular in response to
inflammatory stimuli (e.g. virus infection), activates and attracts leukocytes via its
receptor CD147 to the stimulus site.15 We demonstrated that anti-CD147 antibody could
attenuate the chemotactic index of T cells induced by CyPA.17 Multiple cytokines and
chemokines increased significantly in patients with COVID-19, which was
significantly correlated with pulmonary inflammation index of chest CT imaging.4.22
These results suggest that the excess immune cells migrating into lung tissue may cause
uncontrolled immune response, leading to the inflammation storm, and aggravated
disease. We presumed that meplazumab blocked the interaction between CyPA and
CD147, attenuated the chemotactic effect of CyPA, decreased the immune cells in lung
tissue, and facilitated the improvement of chest radiographic. In this trial, the
remarkable and rapid resolution of inflammatory foci in lungs, like ground-glass
opacity and consolidation, were observed in meplazumab treatment group.
Lymphopenia was common in patients with COVID-19 and SARS patients, and
can be used as an indicator of disease severity and prognosis.23 75.4% patients with
COVID-19 reported lymphopenia.24 Due to the absence of ACE2 in lymphocyte, it has
been proposed that the lymphocytopenia in SARS patient is caused by the indirect
mechanism, including inflammation storm, vascular cell adhesion, soluble Fas ligand,

and glucocorticoids.12,25 However, the SARS-CoV particles and genomic sequence
were detected in a large number of circulating lymphocytes, causing destruction of
lymphocytes.26 In this trial, lymphocyte count in meplazumab-treated patients were
restored in short time. CD147 is high expressed on the activated T cells,17 which may
facilitate the invasion of SARS-CoV-2 to lymphocytes by binding spike protein,
suggesting that CD147 may be involved in lymphocytopenia. Meplazumab interrupted
this process by preventing virus invasion to keep lymphocytes survived. Second, the
meplazumab blocking CD147-CyPA interaction might contribute to lymphocyte
elevation in peripheral blood by inhibiting the lymphocyte accumulation in pulmonary
organ.
In summary, we establish a “specific antibody add-on therapy model”, a combined
therapeutic strategy of the specific antibody with recommended antivirus treatment, and
demonstrate it safe and effective. The effective dosage of antibody by timely
administration attenuates the inflammation in patients with COVID-19, and facilitates
the patients to get through acute exudation of pneumonia. Therefore, antibody therapy
can extend the therapeutic window, thus safeguard patients pass the dangerous period.
A favorable specific antibody drug should inhibit the virus replication and
suppress the inflammation storm. Meplazumab, an anti-CD147 antibody, can block
the receptor of host cells, and inhibit the virus invasion and replication by interrupting
spike protein from recognizing CD147 receptor. Meanwhile, meplazumab blocks the
CD147, the receptor of proinflammatory factor CyPA, thus suppressing the
inflammation.
Although we get the outcomes of meplazumab treatment for COVID-19, our
results are limited by the small subject size and the absence of parallel control.
Therefore, confirmation from larger scale and randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled trial is required to fully assess the efficacy and safety of meplazumab in
patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.
