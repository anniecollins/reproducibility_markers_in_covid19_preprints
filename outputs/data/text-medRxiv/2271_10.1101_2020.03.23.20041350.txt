Abstract:
Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global
pandemic currently. Many drugs showed potential for COVID-19 therapy. However,
genetic factors which can lead to different drug efficiency and toxicity among
populations are still undisclosed in COVID-19 therapy.
Methods: We selected 67 potential drugs for COVID-19 therapy (DCTs) from clinical
guideline and clinical trials databases. 313 pharmaco-genes related to these
therapeutic drugs were included. Variation information in 125,748 exomes were
collected for racial differences analyses. The expression level of pharmaco-genes in
single cell resolution was evaluated from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)
data of 17 healthy adults.
Results: Pharmacogenes, including CYP3A4, ABCB1, SLCO1B1, ALB, CYP3A5,
were involved in the process of more than multi DCTs. 224 potential drug-drug
interactions (DDIs) of DCTs were predicted, while 112 of them have been reported.
Racial discrepancy of common nonsynonymous mutations was found in
pharmacogenes including: VDR, ITPA, G6PD, CYP3A4 and ABCB1 which related to
DCTs including ribavirin, α-interferon, chloroquine and lopinavir. Moreover, ACE2,
the target of 2019-nCoV, was only found in parts of lung cells, which makes drugs
like chloroquine that prevent virus binding to ACE2 more specific than other targeted
drugs such as camostat mesylate.
Conclusions: At least 17 drugs for COVID-19 therapy with predictable
pharmacogenes should be carefully utilized in risk races which are consisted of more
risk allele carriers. At least 29 drugs with potential of DDIs are reported to be affected
by other DDIs, they should be replaced by similar drugs without interaction if it is
possible. Drugs which specifically targeted to infected cells with ACE2 such as

Introduction
In the end of last year, Wuhan (the capital city of Hubei province in China)
reported a new unknown viral pneumonia

[1]

. Subsequent next generation sequencing

identified that it was caused by a novel coronavirus which named as 2019 novel
coronavirus (2019-nCoV)

[2]

. World Health Organization (WHO) named this new

disease as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and declared a Public Health
Emergency of International Concern. Although it is firstly detected in China,
epidemiological monitoring indicates that COVID-19 is experiencing quickly
outbreak across the world. As of 22 March 2020, more than 315,925 cases of infection
and 13,610 cases of death have been confirmed in at least 184 countries.
Clinical characteristics reporting in China revealed that most patients are mild
and moderate [3, 4]. However, severe cases progress rapidly to acute respiratory distress
syndrome (ARDS), shock, multiple organ failure and even death. The National Health
Commission of China released at least seven versions of Guideline of Diagnosis and
Treatment of Pneumonitis Caused by COVID-19

[5]

. Oxygen therapy, mechanical

ventilation and drug therapy are recommended as major treatments, so that several
drugs may be utilized simultaneously in such conditions. It is noteworthy that the
individual difference of drug treatment is mentioned for a special in the guideline.
This promotes the importance of personalized therapy for COVID-19 patients.
It is widely accepted that genetic factor is one of the major contributors to
individual or ethnical differences of drug therapeutic efficacy and toxicity [6, 7]. One of
the examples is chloroquine, which is listed as an antiviral drug for COVID-19
treatments in China. Currently, at least 15 clinical trials are being conducted to
explore

its

efficacy.

However,

of life-threatening severe hemolysis after taking chloroquine

[8]

. As one of the most

common human enzyme defects, genetic variants affecting G6PD activity show
remarkably individual and ethnical differences

[9]

. Thus, it should be widely informed

that chloroquine needs precision medicine.
In addition to chloroquine, a number of other drugs are also used in the
COVID-19 therapy. With the rapid spread of this disease in the worldwide, these
drugs will be used in patients with different ethnic backgrounds. However, the genetic
variants potentially affect their effects and safety are not still available. Their
distributions in different populations in the world are also not indicated. This may
constitute an obstacle for successful treatment and control of this disease.
Pharmacogenetics (PGx) investigates the affection of genetic variants on drug effects
and safety. In the current study, we provide a PGx landscape of drugs with potential to
be used in the COVID-19 treatment. Candidate choices from different drugs based on
pharmacogenetic analyses were provided.
Methods
Data collection
Drugs and their clinical trial information for COVID-19 treatment were col
lected from Guideline of Diagnosis and Treatment of Pneumonitis Caused by C
OVID-19 (version 7.0) (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/yzygj/s7653p/202003/46c9294a7dfe
4cef80dc7f5912eb1989.shtml), Clinical Trails (https://clinicaltrials.gov) and Chine
se Clinical Trail Registry (http://www.chictr.org.cn). The pharmacogenes related
to all drugs were obtained from DrugBank (https://www.drugbank.ca/) and Phar
mGKB (https://www.pharmgkb.org/) databases. Actionable PGx biomarkers were
determined by Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC: ht
tp://cpicpgx.org/guidelines/) and DPWG (http://clivar-dpwg.iri.columbia.edu/) guid

elines. Genetic variation data on each of the genes were retrieved from Gnom
AD database (http://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/, version: 2.1.1). Finally, single-cel
l RNA sequencing (sc-RNA seq) data from two organs (liver (GSE115469, n=5)
and lung (GSE130148, n=4)) of 9 healthy adults was download from GEO da
tabase (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gds).
Sc-RNA seq data analysis
The raw count matrix (unique molecular identifier counts per gene per cell) was
processed by Seurat v3 [12]. Firstly, low-quality data was filtered out as following: (1)
cells expressed less than 10 genes; (2) genes expressed in less than two percent of
cells. Secondly, we calculated log2(count-per-million + 1) expression, and followed by
normalization and standardization. Thirdly, the cells were clustered. In detail, the
highly variable genes were identified and cells were then clustered through
embedding them into a graph structure in Principal Component Analysis space. The
parameter resolution was set as 0.5 to identify only major cell types. The clustered
cells were then projected onto a two-dimensional space and visualized. Finally, the
differentially expressed genes on each cluster were identified. They were used to
annotate and merge the cell clusters according to curated known cell markers
(http://biocc.hrbmu.edu.cn/CellMarker/index.jsp).
Genetic variations annotation and drug-gene network construction
All genetic variations were annotated by allele frequency, location and function in
different populations using ANNOVAR (version: 2019Oct24) (Table S1). In the
current study, populations were divided into eight categories: African, Latino, East
Asian, South Asian, Finnish, Non-Finnish European, Ashkenazi Jewish and Other.
Based on the location and functions, all mutations were divided into 12 categories:
frameshift, non-frameshift, synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP),

nonsynonymous SNP, stop-gain, untranslated regions, intronic and others (including
splicing, upstream of a gene, downstream of a gene, stop-loss and ncRNA_exonic
mutations). Functional nonsynonymous mutations were predicted by PROVEAN
(http://provean.jcvi.org/). The drug-gene network was constructed by Cytoscape
software (version:3.7.1) [10].
Results
Candidate drugs and their clinical trials for COVID-19 treatment
In the current study, a total of 67 drugs were collected in our study, including
agents being used clinically, undergoing clinical trials, only confirmed in vitro
experiments or simply with the therapeutic potential. They could be classified into
nine categories according to their functions: viral toxicity (38.8%) and their
sensitizers (3.0%), inhibiting virus invasion (6.0%), improving lung function (4.5%),
maintaining tissue and organ function balance (25.4%), anti-hypoxic (4.5%),
anti-septic shock (7.5%), anti-secondary infection (6.0%) and others (4.5%) (Figure
1A). Among them, antiviral drugs were mostly important and account for 47.8% in all
drugs (including virus invasion inhibitors, viral toxicity and their sensitizers). As of
March 18, 2020, a total of 125 clinical trials have been conducted to study the safety
and efficacy of antiviral drugs. And most of these clinical trials are all ongoing and
have not been completed. There are six clinical trials involving remdesivir, the earliest
closed one involving 308 participants will be completed on April 27, 2020
(NCT04252664). As many as 16 clinical trials related to chloroquine, and two clinical
trials for mild and common patients and severe patients will be completed on April 30,
2020 (ChiCTR2000029898, ChiCTR2000029899), each clinical trial includes a total
of 100 participants. As for hydroxychloroquine, two of the nine clinical trials have
ended on February 29, 2020 (ChiCTR2000029559, ChiCTR2000029740), and the

results have not yet been available. In addition, the clinical trials of lopinavir (18) and
ritonavir (23) will both be completed as early as March 25, 2020. Information of other
categories of drugs can be found in Figure S1.
Drug-gene network for COVID-19 treatment
Genetic variation is one of the most powerful biomarkers to guide personalized
therapy. Thus, it is important to systematically identify pharmacogenes which could
affect response and toxicity of these 67 drugs. A drug-gene network which
demonstrating the connection of each drug and pharmacogene was constructed
(Figure 2A). After excluding drugs without pharmacogene data, a total of 44 drugs
and 313 genes were connected.
Based on the nodes in this network, we could easily find genes shared by
multiple drugs. They could be the mediator of drug-drug interactions (DDIs) (Figure
2B). In addition, their genetic variations could potentially affect response and toxicity
of a number of different drugs. Thus, these genes should be paid attention during
COVID-19 patient treatment. Among them, the top 2 genes both ligated 16 different
drugs simultaneously. cytochrome P450 family (CYP) 3A4 is one of the major
members of the cytochrome P450 enzymes superfamily, it involved in the metabolism
of about half DCTs. The other one is ATP binding cassette subfamily B member 1
(ABCB1), which is an important transporter pumping out many drugs across the
cellular membrane. Other top 10 genes included: solute carrier family solute carrier
organic anion transporter family member 2B1, ALB, CYP3A5, CYP2C9, solute
carrier family (SLC) 22A6, SLC22A1, CYP2C19 and CYP1A2. Most of them were
related to absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion. It is interesting to note
that almost all of these gene are highly genetically variable and differ between
populations

Another information obtained from this network was that there were actionable
PGx biomarkers for three drugs based on CPIC or DPWG guidelines. They were
G6PD and chloroquine hemolysis toxicity, vitamin D receptor (VDR) and ribavirin
efficacy, inosine triphosphatase (ITPA) and ribavirin/α-interferon anemia risk,
angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) and captopril response. We recommend that
these genes should be preemptively tested before drug treatment.
Mutation profiles of pharmacogenes
We next investigated the allelic frequency, location and function of genetic
mutations for all pharmacogenes in different populations. A total number of 295,897
variations in these 313 genes were found in 125,748 subjects from GnomAD
databases. Although the mutations distributed in all gene regions, the most common
mutation types were intronic, non-synonymous and synonymous mutations (Figure
3A). It should be noteworthy that 32.8% of the mutations were non-synonymous,
which is the major types of functional PGx variants. They could be the explanation of
individual and ethnic difference for COVID-19 drug treatment. To learn the
distribution of mutations in pharmacogenes in more detail. The fractions of different
mutation types were provided for each gene. They were summarized based on the
gene functions in Figure S2. The frequencies of these variations were indicated in
Figure 3B, they showed similar distributions. However, there were remarkably
differences for the total number of mutations.
Then, we explored the allelic frequencies of all mutations. As indicated in Figure
3B, 98.52% of the mutations were rare genetic variants with minor allele frequency
(MAF) lower than 1%. This result emphasized again the importance of
pharmacogenomic scale test before treatment. We further analyzed mutations with
different MAF stratified by populations. Except African population, there was no

significant difference of MAF distribution between the remained seven races (Figure
3C). The African individuals were higher genetically variable for these
pharmacogenes, since they showed more percentages of common mutations
(MAF>1%). This result indicated that they had higher requirement for PGx test.
Taken together, these results indicated that COVID-19 pharmacogenes were
highly genetically variable, especially for African population. Thus, personalized drug
treatment and PGx test is needed for different patients. In addition, these mutations
distributed in all gene regions and most of them were rare variations (Figure 3D).
Therefore, sequencing technologies is recommended for the preemptive test.
Actionable and key PGx biomarkers
To provide clinical guide for COVID-19 treatment, we analyzed the actionable
and key PGx biomarkers in detail. There are four paired actionable pharmacogenes
and drugs: VDR and ribavirin, ITPA and ribavirin/α-interferon, G6PD and
chloroquine, ACE and captopril.
Ribavirin is a classic antivirus drug which has been involved in the guideline for
2019-nCoV therapy as well. VDR polymorphism is associated with its efficacy
(Figure 4A). There is only a common non-synonymous polymorphism M1T
(rs2228570) that could hamper the VDR activity and the M1T carriers showed lower
efficacy. The frequency of this mutation is over 0.5 in all populations (Figure 4A),
which means more than half patients will be resistant to this drug.

α-interferon is usually utilized in combination with antivirus drugs such as
ribavirin in COVID-19 treatment. ITPA polymorphism was reported to be associated
with the anemia risk in ribavirin/α-interferon treatment (Figure 4B). The functional
mutation P32T (rs1127354) reduced the activity of the enzyme encoded by ITPA. The
P32T carriers showed lower anemia risk. Another common non-synonymous

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.23.20041350; this version posted March 30, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

polymorphism E93G (rs34982958) is also found in ITPA (Figure 4B), while its effect
has not been revealed. The P32T was more identified in Asians (both of East Asians
and South Asians, Figure 4B). Therefore, Asians may have a higher anemia risk in
ribavirin/α-interferon treatment.
chloroquine has been utilized for 2019-nCoV therapy as guideline referred.
G6PD polymorphisms has been reported to be associated with hemolysis risk (Figure
4C). There are two important variants V98M (rs1050828) and N156D (rs1050828),
which could decrease the function of G6PD. The V98M and N156D carriers showed
higher hemolysis risk for chloroquine treatment. In addition to these two mutations,
we further identified three other common non-synonymous polymorphisms in all
populations. Among them, the mutation S218F (rs5030868) was also reported to
decrease the activity of G6PD, which indicated that this mutation could increase the
hemolysis risk as well. What’s more, both V98M and N156D were more common in
the African population (Figure 4C), suggesting that chloroquine is not recommended
in African patients.
Lopinavir and ritonavir are used together to reduce their metabolism in liver
through inhibiting the activity of CYP3A4, a very important enzyme which could
metabolize about half of DCTs. The CYP3A4 polymorphism L292P (rs28371759,
CYP*18B) was linked with increased CYP3A4 activity, thus facilitate the metabolism
of drugs like lopinavir. L292P carriers may need to increase the dosage of these drugs
compared with wild type patients (Figure 4D). Another common non-synonymous
polymorphism R162Q in CYP3A4 was still not be reported with CYP3A4 phenotype
now (Figure 4D). L292P was more in East Asians (Figure 4D), indicated that East
Asians may metabolize lopinavir and ritonavir more rapidly.
As we mentioned above, ABCB1 can pumping out many drugs across the

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.23.20041350; this version posted March 30, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

cellular membrane thus alleviate the efficacy. In our drug list, drugs like lopinavir can
be transported out of cells by ABCB1, and its efficacy can be reduced (Figure 4E). We
found there are 10 common non-synonymous polymorphisms in ABCB1 (Figure 4E).
Among them, S893T, S893A (rs2032582), N21D (rs9282564) and S400N (rs2229109)
were reported as deleterious mutations, which can increase the drug concentration
through decreasing the efflux of ABCB1. S893A carriers were found in all
populations with high frequency, which is up to 90% in Africans. S893T carriers were
almost East Asians, while N21D carriers were Europeans (Figure 4E). These patients
may be more response to these drugs transported by ABCB1.
In addition, ACE inhibitors (ACEI) can be used to improve the lung function in
COVID-19 treatment. It was widely reported that ACE polymorphisms could affect
ACEI therapeutic response (Figure 4F). The most important variant was I/D
(rs1799752) polymorphism, which was a low frequency indel mutation causing low
enzyme expression. The D allele carriers showed better response for ACEI treatment.
In addition to this mutation, we further identified 10 common non-synonymous
polymorphisms in all populations (Figure 4F). Although there is no related report
about these variations, G2V (rs558593002), A154T (rs13306087), Y244C
(rs3730025), R324W (rs35141294) and R561W (rs4314) were predicted to be
loss-of-function mutations by PROVEAN. Thus, we speculated that patients
harboring these single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were poor responders of this
drug. Based on their MAFs in different populations, rs1799752 were more identified
in the East Asian population (Figure 4F). Thus, we concluded that East Asian patients
could be more resistance to this drug.
In summary, African patients could be more hazardous to chloroquine, Asian
patients have a higher risk of anemia in ribavirin/α-interferon treatment and are more

resistant to captopril. Meanwhile, drugs like lopinavir and ritonavir which
metabolized by CYP3A4 or transported by ABCB1 should be carefully utilized in
East Asians.
COVID-19 treatment based on sc-RNA seq data
Recently, sc-RNA seq technology was rapidly developed. It is capable to
specifically profile cell populations at the single-cell resolution. Thus, it transformed
many fields of genomic research. Here, we tried to explore the utility of sc-RNA seq
on personalized COVID-19 treatment. We collected healthy adults sc-RNA seq data
from 4 lung and 5 liver tissues.
Lung is the major 2019-nCoV attacking organ. Thus, we analyzed the expression
of virus or drug target genes in different lung cells (Figure 5A). Based on the current
findings, ACE2 and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) were the two major
targets of both virus and some drugs. As indicated in Figure 5B, TMPRSS2 was
almost expressed in all kinds of cells. In our enrolled drugs, camostat mesylate act as
a trypsin like protease inhibitor and could be potentially used to anti-virus by
inhibiting TMPRSS2 activity. Due to the ubiquitous expression of its target, camostat
mesylate could also cause potential toxicity when exerting therapeutic effect. On the
other hand, ACE2 was mainly expressed in type I pneumocyte, type II pneumocyte,
FOXN4+, club and mast cells. chloroquine phosphate can change the ACE2 structure,
or inhibit the binding of coronavirus S protein with ACE2. Based on these data,
chloroquine was more effectively targeting drugs with less side effects (Figure 5C).
Sc-RNA seq data in lung tissue suggested that ACE2 targeting drugs (chloroquine)
were superior for COVID-19 treatment than TMPRSS2 targeting drugs (camostat
mesylate).
Most drugs can be metabolized in the liver. We next analyzed the expression of

drug metabolic enzymes in different liver cells (Figure 6A). CYP1A2, CYP2E1,
CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2B6, CYP2D6, CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 were the major
CYP450 enzymes responsible for 67 drugs metabolism. Their expression was
investigated (Figure 6B, 6D). In addition to hepatocytes, it was unexpected to found
that some enzymes were also found to be highly expressed in immune cells. Based on
the expression distribution, we categorized all enzymes into two groups: (1) narrow
distribution enzymes (NDE) which were only expressed in hepatocytes and scarcely
expressed in other cells, including CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP4F2 and
CYP4F12; (2) wide distribution enzymes (WDE) which is expressed in both
hepatocytes and immune cells in the liver, including CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2D6
and CYP3A5 (Table 1). For our enrolled drugs, anti-viral agents such as α-interferon,
ambroxol, baloxavir and darunavir were mainly metabolize by NDEs, while
thalidomide and valsartan were mainly metabolized by WDEs, and some drugs such
as chloroquine and leflunomide were metabolize by both NDEs and WDEs. Currently,
the consequence of drug metabolism in immune cells still remains unknown. However,
it was rational to speculate that the toxically drug metabolites in the immune cells
would affect liver immunologic function. Thus, in case of producing toxically
metabolites, the drugs that can be metabolized by WDE would be more tending to
cause hepatotoxicity. They should be cautiously used when alternative drugs were
available. Leflunomide can be metabolized by WDEs CYP2C9 which expressed both
in hepatocyte and CD4 + T cells. Its active metabolite, A771726, inhibits cell survival
and proliferation by inhibiting pyrimidine synthesis. The aggregation of A771726 in
CD4

+

T cells inhibits cell survival and proliferation, and damages the liver

immunologic function (Figure 6C). Therefore, leflunomide may be not recommended
while other immunosuppressive drugs are available.

Candidate Strategies for COVID-19 Therapy
Since there are many candidate drugs for COVID-19 therapy, it is important to
make a better choice for each patient. For example, ribavirin and α-interferon are not
suggested in patients with M1T variation in VDR or without P32T variation in ITPA,
then other anti-virus drugs can be used in these patients. Similarly, chloroquine is not
suggested to be utilized in patients with V98M and N156D variants. To avoid these
abuses of drugs in COVID-19 therapy, a genetic detection panel is suggested. In this
panel, SNPs with clinic evidences in pharmacogenes should be considered. The
mutation frequencies are not the same in all populations, and we provided the
frequency of candidate pharmacogenes SNPs in all populations (Figure 7). Mutations
like rs117648444 is only found in FIN, so that the panels for FIN should include this
variation. Meanwhile, suggestions should be given based on these SNPs. Examples
can be found in Table 2.
As a large part of drugs are metabolized by CYP450 in liver, the activity of
CYP450 family may impact many drugs metabolization rate. Due to the activity
difference exists among populations, the genotypes of important alleles in CYP450
family should be detected after diagnosis, then treatment strategies for these drugs can
be suggested in these patients. Meanwhile, DDI should also be considered as many
drugs may be utilized together during COVID-19 treatment as mentioned above. For
instance, drugs like lopinavir and ritonavir can inhibit the activity of CYP3A4, thus
the drugs dosage should be adjusted when combined with drugs metabolized by
CYP3A4. Drugs that were metabolized by CYP450 family in COVID-19 therapy
were listed in Table 3. In addition, when chloroquine is utilized, drugs like losartan
which can increase the concentration of chloroquine may be replaced by valsartan.
Validated DDIs between drugs for COVID-19 treatment are given in table 3.

Finally, based on current researches, 2019-nCoV can only infect cells with ACE2.
As indicated above, ACE2 is not expressed in all cells, while TMPRSS2 can be found
in large part of cells. So that drugs like camostat mesylate is not recommended
compared to ACE2 specific inhibitors due to the side effect caused by TMPRSS2 in
uninfected cells.
Discussion
This study firstly focused pharmacogenetics and provided clinical suggestions
for precision medicine in COVID-19 treatment systematically. 44 DCTs were showed
to associated with at least one gene. And drug-gene network highlighted multi drug
related genes in COVID-19 treatment. Meanwhile, inter-racial variances in drug
efficacy were found related to nonsynonymous mutations among different races,
which indicated that racial special strategy for COVID-19 therapy should be
considered during the outbreak of COVID-19 worldwide. Since nonsynonymous
mutations and gene expression levels can both affect the DCTs efficacy and toxicity
as mentioned above, optimized therapy strategies are needed to benefit these affected
patients all over the world. In this study, we give three suggestions for DCTs as
follows. Firstly, drugs in CPIC guideline including ribavirin, α-interferon, chloroquine
and captopril should be utilized with genetic detections as guided. In this situation,
adequate gene detection kits should be prepared in Africa for COVID-19 therapy, as
related genetic variation frequency is higher in AFRs than other countries. Secondly,
drug such as chloroquine whose efficacy and toxicity can be determined by
nonsynonymous mutations, may be preferred in special population with lower
frequency of risk alleles such as Finnish and Non-Finnish European. Otherwise,
alternative drug for chloroquine can be used in high risk populations. Thirdly, for
drugs that can inhibit the activity of CYP450, DDI should be prevented in COVID-19

treatment (Table 1). When inhibitors of CYP450 were utilized, the dosage of these
drugs should be adjudged carefully to avoid overdosage.
Although precision medicine should be considered in COVID-19 treatment, there
are still many challenges to face. The first challenge is that pharmacogenes of many
drugs for COVID-19 are still not clear, due to that many newly developed drugs are
still under clinical trials, their pharmacogenes can hardly be fully identified currently.
A potential solution is to predict candidate pharmacogenes according to the chemical
structure of a new drug by the artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithm
[21, 22]

. Then related molecular biological studies can be conducted to validate these

candidate pharmacogenes rapidly. Then the period of pharmacogenes identification
can be shorted. The second challenge is that some serious nonsynonymous mutations
can be hardly identified in current pharmacogenetics studies, due to the frequencies of
many nonsynonymous mutations are lower than 1%. That’s why the nonsynonymous
mutations we presented above are common variants. If there are only a few patients
carried a serious nonsynonymous mutation, related study can hardly be conducted to
identify this mutation because of the limited sample size. However, as we indicated in
Figure 3, most of nonsynonymous mutations are rare variations. Therefore, a reliable
way to predict potential pharmacogenetic variation is also important to improve the
efficacy or avoid serious toxicity [23]. The third challenge is that a suitable strategy for
precision medicine in COVID-19 treatment is still lack. A well-designed gene
detection panel is important to fully characterized the patients’ genotypes which relate
to the drug effects [24]. Then the best treatment regimen can be utilized for this patient,
and both of the efficacy and the safety can be guaranteed. In our study, feasible
suggestions were given, and it still can be much improved with the development of
some pharmacogenetic studies in the future. Last but not least, the expression level of

pharmacogenes in patients can hardly be detected in single cell resolution during
COVID-19 treatment, although the expression level of these genes can be associated
with drug efficacy or toxicity. A potential solution is to build a systematic
pharmacogenes expression map in single cell level among different populations in
different age stages

[25]

. This map would be helpful for personalized medicine in the

future.
