Abstract:
Background: Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has been considered to treat Coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19) but data on efficacy is conflicting. we analyzed the efficacy of HCQ) in
addition to standard of care (SOC) compared with SOC alone in reducing disease progression in
Mild COVID-19
Methods: A single centre open label randomized controlled trial during 10th April to 31st May
2020 was conducted at Pak emirates Military Hospital (PEMH) Five hundred patients of both
genders having age between 18-80 years with Mild COVID-19 were enrolled. Patients assigned
to standard dose of HCQ plus SOC were 349 while 151 patients received SOC (control group).
Primary outcome was progression of disease while secondary outcome was PCR negativity on
day 7 and 14. The results were analyzed on SPSS version 23. P value <0.05 was considered
significant.
Results: Median age of intervention group (34 + 11.778 years) and control group (34 + 9.813
years). Disease progressed in 16 patients, 11 (3.15%) were in intervention group as compared to
5 (3.35%) in control group, (P value = 0.865). PCR negativity in intervention and control groups
were (day 7, 182 (52.1%) vs. 54 (35.7%) (P value = 0.001), (day 14, 244 (69.9%) vs. 110
(72.8%) (P value = 0.508). Consecutive PCR negativity at day 7 and 14 was observed in 240
(68.8%) in intervention group compared to 108 (71.5%) in control group. (P value = 0.231).
Conclusion: Addition of HCQ to SOC in Mild COVID-19 neither stops disease progression nor
help in early and sustained viral clearance.
Clinical Trial number: NCT04491994 available at ClinicalTrials.gov
Key words: COVID-19, viral clearance, mild infection, disease progression, trial, HCQ.

Introduction
Beyond supportive care, there are currently no proven treatment options for coronavirus disease
(COVID-19)1. As mortality in patients with critical category is quite substantial2, hence every
effort has to be made to intervene early and aggressively in order to prevent progression of
disease. Globally, approximately eight million confirmed cases of Covid-19 have been reported
with an outcome based overall mortality of 5.51%3. In Pakistan, there is exponential rise in
Covid-19 cases in last few months. Nevertheless, data from various international studies shows
that 81% of patients have had mild to moderate disease, which includes non-pneumonia and
pneumonia cases4. Management of mild disease is equally important as this is the main bulk
involved in transmission of disease to others. It is well known fact that asymptomatic carriers
and patients with mild disease are also the main sources of disease transmissibility5. Therefore, it
is a matter of utmost importance to detect mild cases earlier and start some investigational
treatment in carefully selected hospitalized patients. Different investigational treatment options
have been tried in different severity categories of COVID-19. Out of many therapeutic off-label
options, HCQ seems more suitable owing to its known safety profile, side effects, posology and
drug interactions6. HCQ has been found to have good in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-27and
better safety profile than chloroquine8. A small study on 36 patients shows that
hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) treatment is significantly associated with viral load
reduction/disappearance in COVID-19 patients9. Similarly, it has been hypothesized that HCQ
might inhibit cytokine storm by reducing CD154 expression in T cells, thus reducing chances of
disease progression10. Therapeutic role of HCQ can be determined by time required for virologic
clearance as well as to see whether disease is getting worse or not on the basis of symptoms
aggravation and monitoring laboratory markers of Cytokine release storm. In Pakistan, PEMH is
the largest Covid-19 designated hospital in the country. This hospital has already treated more
than 3000 Covid-19 patients so far including many asymptomatic and mild cases. On the basis of
limited evidence available, HCQ was given after consent to Mild Covid-19 patients with an aim
to achieve early viral clearance and prevent progression of disease. Later on, we analyzed the
data to assess the response.

Materials/subjects:
This single Centre, parallel open label randomized controlled trial was carried out during 10th
April to 31st May 2020 at department of Pulmonology, Pakistan Emirates Military Hospital
(PEMH) over 500 patients from both genders between 18-80 years of age. The study design was
approved by institutional ethical review committee (ERC). The study population was comprised
of patients from both genders with Mild confirmed COVID-19 after their written consent. The
study protocol and approval documents are available online at ClinicalTrials.gov with trial
number of NCT04491994.
Sample size was calculated using OPEN EPI with 5% level of Confidence and 80% power to
detect a difference and enrolment ration 2:1 between intervention and control group, at a twosided significance level of α=0.05, of 7 days in the median time to clinical improvement between
the two groups, assuming that the median time in the SOC group was 14 days and assuming 55%
efficacy of HCQ in preventing disease progression and achieving viral clearance at day 7.
Calculated sample size was 467, however we used a sample size of 500.
During study period, 672 confirmed PCR positive cases were assessed for eligibility. 132 did not
meet selection criteria and subsequently excluded. 540 patients were then enrolled and
randomized. Further 20 patients were excluded from analysis as 15 withdrew consent and 5
became symptomatic before first dose of HCQ. During follow up 13 patients were found to be
deviated from advised therapy and 7 were lost to follow up yielding a final study population of
500. Figure 1 summarizes this process. Randomization rules were designed by Dr. Wasim
Alamgir together with principal investigators and implemented by an independent statistician
who was not involved in data analysis. Stratified random sampling was applied to stratify all
eligible patients according to age, gender and comorbidities. Computerized random number
generator was used and allocation was done in 2:1 sequence. Cards with each group assignment
number randomly generated by computer were placed in sequentially numbered envelopes that
were opened as the patients were enrolled
A total of 349 patients included in intervention group and 151 in control group. In Hospital,
HCQ was given to patients after written consent and after considering its contraindications.
Three hundred and forty-nine (349) patients were included in intervention group and given HCQ
in addition to SOC. After 12 hours of randomization HCQ was given. Standard dose of HCQ was
400 mg by mouth twice a day for day one followed by 200 mg 12 hourly for next 5 days. The
patients who did not give consent for treatment with HCQ or had a known allergy to HCQ or
chloroquine or had another known contraindication to treatment with the study drug, including
retinopathy, G6PD deficiency and QT prolongation served as controls. Controls were matched
with participants on the basis of age, gender and co morbids and comprised of 151 patients.
Standard of care (SOC) treatment comprised of daily oral Vit C (2gms), oral Zinc (50mg), oral
Vit-D (alfacalcidol 1ug) and tablet Paracetamol (for body aches/fever), intravenous fluids,

hemodynamic monitoring, and laboratory testing for SARS-CoV-2 and baseline blood
parameters. Neither patients, nor investigators, nor statisticians were masked to treatment
assignment. Lab staff who performed sampling for PCR, basic blood tests and other routine
measurement were unaware of treatment information. Side effect of drug were monitored daily.
Patients on HCQ underwent daily ECG to assess QT prolongation. An increase in QT interval
>25% from baseline was considered significant and HCQ stopped. Any visual complaint by the
patient warrant urgent referral to eye specialist and stoppage of drug. Data regarding age, comorbidities, history of contact with a positive patient, days since contact, duration of symptoms,
PCR status with date and base line labs/X-ray chest were recorded. Any patient with day 0 CRP
greater than 6mg/dl, Absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) < 1000 or evidence of infiltrates on Xray chest were excluded. Daily temperature, respiratory rate (RR) and resting O2 saturation with
pulse oximetry were monitored in all patients during their hospitalization.
A case was considered confirmed on the basis of positivity of RT-PCR of combined
Oropharyngeal and Nasopharyngeal swabs. Severity of disease was defined as per criteria
designed by WHO11. Mild disease meant Patients with uncomplicated upper respiratory tract
viral infection having non-specific symptoms such as low-grade fever (fever < 100F for < 3
days), fatigue, body aches, cough (with or without sputum production), anorexia, muscle pain,
sore throat, nasal congestion, anosmia, headache and rarely diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. PCR
sampling was done on day 7 and 14 of admission. Any chronic health condition for which
patients were on prior treatment was considered as co morbidity. After start of treatment,
development of fever > 101 F for > 72 hours, shortness of breath by minimal exertion (10-Step
walk test), derangement of basic lab parameters (ALC < 1000 or raised CRP) or appearance of
infiltrates on CXR during course of treatment was labeled as progression irrespective of PCR
status. PCR status of patients was checked after 7 days and 14 days of initiation of treatment.
Inclusion criteria included (1) Mild Corona virus disease (COVID-19) (2) PCR confirmed
infection (3) Hospital admitted patients (4) 18-80 years age Exclusion criteria were (1) Moderate,
severe and critical COVID-19 (2) day 0 CRP greater than 6mg/dl, ALC < 1000 or evidence of
infiltrates on X-ray chest (3) comorbidity with life expectancy less than 6 months (4)
Contraindications to HCQ therapy. Primary outcome was disease progression within 5 days of
start of treatment. This was defined by development of fever > 101 F for > 72 hours, shortness of
breath by minimal exertion (10- Step walk test), derangement of basic lab parameters (ALC <
1000 or raised CRP) or appearance of infiltrates on CXR. Patients underwent 6 hourly axillary
temperature check, daily 10 feet walk test, daily Blood counts, CRP and X-Rays on day 0, 3 and
5. Secondary outcome was Viral clearance. PCR negativity on day 7 and 14 after admission was
recorded. Statistical interpretation of data was performed using Statistical Package for Social
Sciences (SPSS) version 23. Results were expressed as mean, standard deviation (±SD) for all
continuous variables and frequency and percentage for categorical data. We used t-test and chisquare test as appropriate to the nature and distribution of the variables. A p-value < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.

Results:
During the study, a total of 500 patients of Mild COVID-19 were included, with a mean age of
35.96 ± 11.2 years (intervention group: 34 + 11.778 vs. control group: 34 + 9.813), Overall,
males 466 (93.2%) and females 34 (6.8%) were included in trial. Male to female proportion in
intervention and control groups were 328(94%) male and 21(6 %) females vs 139 (91.4%) male
and 13(8.6%) females respectively. Most patients were healthy young individuals with comorbids only in 38 (7.6%), 31(8.9%) in intervention and 7 (4.6%) in control group. Type 2
Diabetes Mellitus (DM) in 15 (3%) was the commonest disease. Positive contact history was
found in 315 (63%) patients. Among constitutional symptoms, cough 163 (32.6%), low grade
fever 133 (26.6%), body aches 96 (19.2%), anosmia 83(16.6%) and fatigue 56 (11.2%) were the
most common. Less common symptoms were sore throat 33 (6.6%), diarrhea 21 (4.2%) and
headache 21 (4.2%). Completely asymptomatic patients were 101 (20.2%). HCQ in addition to
SOC treatment was given to intervention group comprising of 349 (69.8%) patients while 151
(30.2%) patients of control group received only SOC treatment.
Among 16 patients who showed disease progression (Table-1), 11 (3.15%) were from
intervention group, and 5 (3.3%) from control group with P value of 0.940. Co morbids were
present in 31 (8.9%) patients in intervention group, and 7 (4.66%) (P value = 0.095) in control
group. In intervention group, out of 11 patients with diseases progression, 4/31 (12.9%) were
with co morbids as compared to 2 out of 7 (28.6%) in control group (P value = 0.304). Overall,
Progression of disease was significantly associated with presence of co morbidities as 6 (15.8%)
patients out of 38 with co morbids showed progression as compared to only 10 (2.2%) out of 462
patients without co morbids. (P-value < 0.00001).
Overall, PCR negativity was observed in 236 (47.2%) patients on day 7 and in 354 (70.8%)
patients on day 14. Effects of HCQ on PCR status of study population is given in Table 2. Day
wise PCR negativity in intervention and control groups respectively were as follows; (day 7: 182
(52.1%) vs. 54 (35.7%) (P value = 0.001), (day 14; 244 (69.9%) vs. 110 (72.8%) (P value =
0.508). Successive day 7- and 14-day PCR negativity was observed in 240 (68.8%) patients in
intervention group vs. 106 (70.1%) in control group (P value = 0.231) PCR remained positive in
62 (17.8%) patients of intervention group vs. 32 (21.2%) patients of control group (P
value=0.231).

Discussion
Although there was much hype about effectiveness of HCQ in treating COVID-19 but our study
did not show any significant benefit of using HCQ. Firstly, HCQ did not prevent progression of
disease in patients with or without co morbids although it was postulated to dampen cytokine
release storm by Dan Zhou et al10. Secondly, as far as PCR negativity was concerned, its
addition to supportive treatment showed significantly better early PCR negativity at day 7, but at
day 14 there was not much difference in PCR negativity between the two studied groups.
Nonetheless, it did not show any side effects in our study.
We used the same doses of HCQ as used by Yao X et al12 and no side effects were observed in
their study also. Results of our study are also contrary to a highly publicized study done by Gao J
et al13 which showed early viral clearance and decreased rate of disease progression.
Comparatively it was a study with smaller sample size (n=100) and they used Chloroquine
instead of HCQ used in our study. As far as viral clearance at day 7 is concerned, our results are
similar to that of non-randomized control trial from France by Gautret et al9. Their study showed
significantly better viral clearance at day 6 of inclusion ((70% vs. 12.5%; P = 0.001) with use of
600mg/day of HCQ for 10 days. However, in addition to HCQ, they also used Azithromycin.
Although highly rated initially, this study had only 20 participants in interventional arm out of
which 6 removed from study due to intolerance to medication. In addition, it was a nonrandomized trial containing major biases between studied groups, and patients were not followed
till day 14 to see viral clearance again. In comparison, we followed patients at day 14 and found
that a subset of day 7 PCR negatives turned positive again on day 14. This observation found in
our study might be because of false negative PCR at day 7 owing to variable sensitivities of
testing kits or a false positive PCR at day 14 due to presence of non-infective dead viral particles.
When we compare results of our study with RCT done by Chen J et al14, interestingly it is found
that although day 7 PCR results of our study are showing clear edge to HCQ but the primary
endpoints in both studies are comparable. Chen J et al used the same dose of HCQ as in our
study but in moderate COVID-19 as compared to mild category used in our research. Their study
showed that HCQ did not prevent progression of disease and there was similar viral clearance
between supportive treatment group and HCQ group (93.3% vs. 86.7%) (p value > 0.05) at day
7. However, sample size included 30 patients and PCR status was not checked at day 14. Our
study demonstrates similar results as recommended by Infectious diseases society of America by
Adarsh bhimraj et al 15. They analyzed three RCTs and six comparative cohort studies done on
confirmed COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized and treated with HCQ. They studied many
variables such as mortality, clinical progression, clinical improvement and adverse events and
concluded that HCQ failed to show any benefit in term of viral clearance or halting progression
of disease. In our study disease progression was significantly higher in patients with co
morbidities even at younger age. This observation is proven in a large-scale study which had
demonstrated that patients with chronic diseases are at higher risk of disease progression16. As at

start of pandemic in Pakistan, our hospital had policy to admit every PCR positive case, hence,
the median age of our study population was relatively younger. In our study 93.2% population
was male. Overall, it has been seen that corona viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome
(SARS)-CoV and the Middle East respiratory syndrome–CoV (MERS) predominantly affect
male gender17 and may be for same genetic reasons SARS-CoV-2 is also predominantly
affecting male population.
Nevertheless, there are certain limitations of our study as well. Firstly, the main subgroup in
which study was done were males so the results cannot be generalized to both genders. Secondly,
the study was done in mild cases and moderate/severe cases were not included so it cannot be
determined whether HCQ is of any benefit in advanced COVID-19 or not. Thirdly, the patients
were not followed up after discharge from the hospital hence, exact progression of disease could
not be ascertained. Fourthly, we did not use quantitive RT-PCR to exactly determine the viral
load which is a strong bias to affect viral clearance. Fifthly, PCR positivity at day 14 is of
uncertain significance because it is now evident that after 10th day onset of illness, presence of
non-replicable viral nucleic acid material only, are being picked up by the PCR18,19 and such
patients are regarded as non-infective. Finally, even with best sampling techniques, sensitivity of
RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 ranges between 34-80%20 so exact estimation of viral clearance will
definitely remain under question. Despite the limitations, our study is first of its own kind in
Pakistan which is reinforced by a larger sample size and relatively longer follow up time.

Conclusion
Our study shows that addition of HCQ to supportive treatment in mild COVID-19 cases is not
significantly associated with prevention of disease progression. Despite showing significantly
early PCR negativity at day 7, day 14 PCR results are similar to that of non HCQ arm. The
findings of our study correlate with the results of various clinical trials done internationally.
