Abstract: We generalise the epidemic Renormalisation Group framework while connecting
it to a SIR model with time-dependent coefficients. We then confront the model with COVID19 in Denmark, Germany, Italy and France and show that the approach works rather well
in reproducing the data. We also show that a better understanding of the time dependence
of the recovery rate would require extending the model to take into account the number of
deaths whenever these are over 15% of the total number of infected cases.

Introduction

Epidemic dynamics is often described in terms of a simple model introduced long time ago in
[1]. Here, the affected population is described in terms of compartmentalised sub-populations
that have different roles in the dynamics. Then, differential equations are designed to describe
the time evolution of the various compartments. The sub-populations can be chosen to
represent (S)usceptible, (I)nfected and (R)ecovered individuals (SIR model), obeying the
following differential equations:
dS
I
= −γS ,
dt
N
dI
I
= γS − εI ,
dt
N
dR
= εI ,
dt

(1.1)

S(t) + I(t) + R(t) = N .

(1.2)

with the conservation law
The system depends on three parameters, namely γ, ε and N . Due to the conservation law
(1.2), only two equations are independent, so that one can drop the equation for S.
˜
The total number of infected, I(t),
that we are interested in, is related to the above
sub-populations as
˜ = I(t) + R(t) .
I(t)

Empirical modifications of the basic SIR model exist and range from including new subpopulations to generalise the coefficients γ, ε to be time-dependent in order to better reproduce the observed data.
Recently the epidemic Renormalisation Group approach (eRG) to pandemics, inspired
by particle physics methodologies, was put forward in [2] and further explored in [3]. In the
latter paper it was demonstrated the eRG effectiveness when describing how the pandemic
spreads across different regions of the world.
The goal of the present work is to further extend the eRG framework to properly take
into account the number of recovered cases so that a better understanding of the reproduction
number can also be achieved. We will start, first, by providing a map between the original eRG
model and certain modified SIR models. We will finally test the framework via COVID-19
data.
1.1

Reviewing the eRG

In the epidemic renormalisation group (eRG) approach [2], rather than the number of cases,
it is convenient to discuss its logarithm, which is a more slowly varying function
˜ ,
α(t) = ln I(t)

(1.6)

where ln indicates the natural logarithm. The derivative of α with respect to time provides
a new quantity that we interpret as the beta-function of an underlying microscopic model.
In statistical and high energy physics, the latter governs the time (inverse energy) dependence of the interaction strength among fundamental particles. Here it regulates infectious
interactions.
More specifically, as the renormalisation group equations in high energy physics are expressed in terms of derivatives with respect to the energy µ, it is natural to identify the time
as t/t0 = − ln(µ/µ0 ), where t0 and µ0 are respectively a reference time and energy scale. We
choose t0 to be one week so that time is measured in weeks, and will drop it in the following. Thus, the dictionary between the eRG equation for the epidemic strength α and the
high-energy physics analog is
β(α) =

dα
dα
=−
.
d ln (µ/µ0 )
dt

(1.7)

It has been shown in [2] that α captures the essential information about the infected population within a sufficiently isolated region of the world. The pandemic beta function can be

parametrised as

α n
dα

a
whose solution, for n = 1, is a familiar logistic-like function
− β(α) =

α(t) =

aeγ̃t
.
b + eγ̃t

(1.8)

(1.9)

The dynamics encoded in Eq. (1.8) is that of a system that flows from an UV fixed point
at t = −∞ where α = 0 to an IR fixed point where α = a. The latter value encodes the
total number of infected cases P = exp(a) in the region under study. The coefficient γ̃ is the
diffusion slope, while b shifts the entire epidemic curve by a given amount of time. Further
details, including what parameter influences the flattening of the curve and location of the
inflection point and its properties can be found in [2].
1.2

Connecting eRG with SIR while extending it

To start connecting with compartmental models we rewrite Eq. (1.7) as
!
˜
ln

dI˜
= γ̃ I˜ ln I˜ 1 −

˜ = ln P , is a logistic function written
whose solution, with the initial condition ln I˜0 = ln I(0)

˜ = exp a
I(t)
.
(1.11)
−γ̃t
be
+1
In the original eRG framework the number of recovered individuals were not explicitly
taken into account. This is, however, straightforward to implement by introducing an equation
for dR/dt and imposing a conservation law equivalent to the one for the SIR model. A minimal
choice compatible with the conservation law is
dR
= εI ,
dt


dI
ln(I + R)
= γ̃(I + R) ln(I + R) 1 −
− εI ,
dt
ln P


dS
ln(I + R)
= −γ̃(I + R) ln(I + R) 1 −
,
dt
ln P

(1.12)

where the parameters are γ̃, P and ε. At fixed N , γ̃ , P and for any value of ε, the SIR
model in (1.1) and the eRG systems of equations match if we allow γ to be the following
time-dependent function


ln(I(t) + R(t))
N
γ(t) = γ̃(I(t) + R(t)) ln(I(t) + R(t)) 1 −
.

ln P
I(t)S(t)
As we shall see this is a welcome feature. To better appreciate the mapping we show in
figure 1 the time-dependent γ parameter for a hypothetical case with N = 7 millions, P = 300

thousands, ε = 1 and γ̃ = 0.7 with initial conditions I(0) = 3, R(0) = 0 and S(0) = N − I(0).
The result is a smooth function that peaks at short times and then plateaus to a fraction of
γ̃. In other words the eRG naturally encodes a rapid diffusion of the disease in the initial
states of the epidemic and the slow down at later times.
1.3

Reproduction number

An important quantity for pandemics is the reproduction number related to the expected
average number of infected cases due to one case. In the time-dependent generalised SIR
model it is identified as:
γ(t)
R0 (t) =
.
(1.14)
ε(t)
To extract R0 from data it is useful to recast it as:
R0 =

(1.15)

The result holds for γ and ε generic functions of time. Here we also generalise the timedependence of ε to be:


2 
t−t
− 12 W 0
ε(t) = A 1 − c · e
.
(1.16)
As it is clear from its form this function has a dip at t0 (possibly correlated with the peak
of the newly infected cases) of width W and depth c · A with A the asymptotic value for
t → ±∞.

–4–

As we shall see the shape allows for a substantial increase of R0 near the peak of the
newly infected cases that could be due to a number of factors including possible health-system
stress around this period.

Testing the framework

As a timely application we consider the COVID-19 pandemic. Here the factor N/S in (1.15)
can be neglected as the number of total infected is at most of O(1%) of the total susceptible
population and the ratio is therefore very close to unity. The reproduction number can hence
be estimated as:
newly infected(t)
.
(2.1)
R0 (t) =
newly recovered(t)
The values for the numerator and denominator for different regions of the world can be obtained from several sources such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and Worldometers.
As testbed scenarios we consider four benchmark cases, namely Denmark, Germany,
France and Italy. These countries adopted different degrees of containment measures. We
find convenient to bin the data in weeks to smooth out daily fluctuations. We associate an
error to both newly infected and newly recovered given by the square root of their values.
Procedurally we first fit the function α(t) to determine a, b and γ following [2, 3]. We
then solve with these, as input, the system of equations (1.12) and ε(t) given in (1.16). The
parameters entering in the function ε(t) are obtained by performing a χ2 minimization to the
data related to the recovered cases. Combining the results with γ(t) we compare R0 (t) with
the actual data.
For each country we show the data and the model results by grouping together five
˜
graphs in a single figure. The different panels represent I(t),
R(t), R0 (t), γ(t) and ε(t), all as
function of the week number. Additionally the data will be reported starting some time after
the outbreak. The reason being that the values of the number of recovered cases at early times
is too small to be reliable and begins to be sizeable only few weeks after the outbreak. For
our predictions ε(t), γ(t) and R0 (t) we show bands limiting the 90% confidence level. Those
are obtained shifting the data for the number of recovered cases by 1.65 standard deviations.
The fitting errors for γ̃, a and b from the method in [2] can be neglected given that these
parameters are highly constrained by the data.
In general we find good agreement between the data and the model with the exception of
the increase in the number of infected cases occurring in the last weeks for some of the countries. Those are non-smooth events resulting from an abrupt change in the social distancing
measures or from new and previously un-accounted disease hotspots. As such those events
cannot be predicted by smooth models.

Denmark

The data and the model results for Denmark are shown in Fig. 2. For the time-dependence

over 10 weeks. Overall we find that the eRG model provides a reasonable description of the
time dependence of the reproduction number. We observe that the recovery rate ε(t) grows
with time by a factor of five. There could be several factors contributing to this growth, one
being a better trained health system.
2.2

Germany

For Germany the analysis is summarised in Fig. 3. The overall trends are similar to the
Danish case including the temporal trend of the recovery rate ε(t).
2.3

Italy

The analysis for Italy is shown in figure 4. We observe rather large values of R0 compared to
Denmark at early times and a factor of two with respect to Germany. We also observe that
a good fit is obtained for γ(t) approaching very small values at large times. This is different

from Germany and Denmark, suggesting strong distancing measures being adopted by the
Italian government. This seems to be further followed by a smaller value of the recovery
rate, roughly about a fourth. However this last comparison is biased by the fact that the
number of deaths in Italy is about 15% of the number of infected cases while in Germany
and Denmark it is below 5% suggesting that a more accurate description at large times would
require introducing also a compartment accounting for the deaths.
2.4

France

The results for the French case can be found in Fig. 5 with the overall picture similar to
the Italian one. The striking difference compared to the other countries is that the recovery
rate decreases at late times. Given that the deaths in France amount to about 20% of the
total infected, such difference indicates that a more complete model (including the deaths
compartment) is needed.

Conclusions

We generalised the epidemic Renormalisation Group framework to take into account the
recovered cases and to be able to determine the time dependence of the reproduction number.
At the same time we show that the eRG framework can be embedded into a SIR model with
time-dependent coefficients. Interestingly the resulting infection rate γ(t) is a smooth curve
with a maximum at early times while rapidly plateauing at large times. This is a welcome
behaviour since it encodes the slow down in the spreading of the disease at large times coming,
for example, from social distancing.
We then move to confront the model to actual data by considering the spread of COVID19 in the following countries: Denmark, Germany, Italy and France. We show that the
overall approach works rather well in reproducing the data. Nevertheless the interpretation
for the recovery rate is natural for Denmark and Germany while it requires to add the deaths
compartment for Italy and France. The reason being that for the first two countries the
number of deaths is below 5% of the number of infected cases while it is above 15% for

countries with similar number of deaths. The extension of the eRG to include also the death
compartment is a natural next step.
