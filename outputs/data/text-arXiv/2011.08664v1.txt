Abstract
We propose an SEIR-type meta-population model to simulate and monitor the Covid-19
epidemic evolution. The basic model consists of seven compartments, namely susceptible
(S), exposed (E), three infective classes, recovered (R), and deceased (D). We define these
compartments for n age and gender groups in m different spatial locations. So, the resulting model has, for each age group, gender, and place, all epidemiological classes. The
mixing between them is accomplished by means of time-dependent infection rate matrices.
The model is calibrated with the curve of daily new infections in New York City and its
boroughs, including census data, and the proportions of infections, hospitalizations, and
deaths for each age range. We end up with a model that matches the reported curves and
predicts accurately infection information for different places and age classes.

Introduction

During December 2019, in Wuhan, China, many cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome,
caused by an unknown virus, were registered. Since then, the virus was named SarsCov-2 and the corresponding disease was called by the acronym Covid-19, which means
Coronavirus Disease 2019. On 11-Mar-2020, a pandemic was declared by the World Health
Organization (WHO). Then, by 08-Oct-2020 Sars-Cov-2 has infected more than 36 million
individuals and has caused more than one million deaths around the world.
One clear message from the above history of the pandemics so far is that the study and
management of the crisis calls for the use of spatial-temporal epidemiological models and
to their appropriate calibration by means of mathematical tools from numerical analysis
and regularization theory [15, 29]. This is the first goal of the present article.
It is now well-documented that the chance of developing the more severe form of the
disease increases dramatically with age [32, 36, 38, 35, 8]. In addition, the infection shows
to be more frequent in older people [8]. This indicates that age plays an important role in
possible containment and mitigation measures. Gender also seems to play a major role on
Covid-19 outcomes, as documented in [5, 22]. Incorporating age and gender structure in
the model is the second goal of this article.
2

The absence of a universally available vaccine and of an effective treatment, by the
time this article is written, limits considerably the number of possible actions to control the
spread of the disease and the subsequent volume of hospitalizations and deaths. Thus, only
containment or mitigation policies, like quarantine or lockdown may be applied. However,
such measures have been causing an unprecedented impact on the economy and labor
market, leading to massive unemployment and recession [9]. The International Monetary
Fund has revised its forecast in April 2020 and it predicted a 4.9% drop in global output
in 2020 [33].
Quantifying and tracking the disease spread in different places and age ranges, as well
as its impact on the health system, is useful to decide if lockdown measures can be relaxed,
allowing then the return of economic activities gradually. This is the third goal of this
work.
Moreover, an accurate forecasting of the number of regular hospital and intensive care
unit (ICU) beds allows a better use of public resources, bringing economic relief.
Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) and Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR)
models have been used to describe different disease outbreaks dynamics since the seminal
work [24]. See also [23] in a textbook format. Recently, several authors [2, 6, 7, 13, 17,
36, 37] have applied SIR- and SEIR-type models to describe the Covid-19 epidemic, including different features, like geographical information and time-dependent transmission
parameters.
In this article, we also propose a versatile SEIR-type model applied to Covid-19 epidemic dynamics. Our model takes into consideration different levels of disease severity,
its impact on age ranges, and the distribution of the population in different locations.
Following [32], individuals in a severe state of this disease are accounted in our model as
hospitalized, while those critically ill are considered in an intensive care unit (ICU). The interaction between classes of infected and susceptible individuals from different age-ranges,
genders, and places is defined by time-dependent transmission matrices. Such matrices,
if appropriately calibrated with up-to-date data on daily new infections, can be used to
reconstruct the status of the disease spread and they allow us to verify the impact of
containment measures.
Concerning vaccines, the flexible general form of our model can be used to design
vaccination strategies that account for age, gender, and spatial distribution of susceptible
population. From the sanitary point of view, such designed strategies may break the transmission chain of the disease, while optimizing the costs of immunization of the population
3

on the financial side.
The dependency of disease severity on age-range and gender is translated into the
model through transmission rates, as well as the rates of recovery, hospitalization, ICU
admission, and death. The values of those rates are based on publicly available datasets and
recent studies that analysed, among other characteristics, the relationship between Covid19 severity and age [37, 8, 32, 11] or gender [5, 22]. Other parameters, like mean incubation
time and case fatality rate outside ICU, were obtained from [26, 19, 20, 21, 38, 35].
As mentioned above, our proposed model also accounts for spatial information. Policy
makers can then identify clusters of uncontained disease spread in real time, isolate them,
and later verify if the chosen imposed restrictions measures were effective. Moreover, the
model can be used to detect which regions should be reopened first, thus reducing the
impact a lockdown creates on economy. Once an effective vaccine is available, the model
could be used to target regions where there are clusters of infected individuals. This
approach would then be used to create immunization belts around such regions. Moreover,
the proposed model is able to forecast future spatial- and age-distributed clusters of infected
individuals and bring information to design contention or immunization measures.
We end up with a model that is useful to track and forecast epidemics caused by new
emerging pathogens, including Sars-Cov-2, in different geographical scales, gender, times,
and age classes. The model is easy to implement, since the set of ordinary differential
equations (ODE) can be solved by general-purpose ODE solvers. Furthermore, the model
is simple to calibrate, with, for example, gradient-based optimizers or Bayesian inference
algorithms.
We obtain the geographical distribution of the disease dynamics considering the five
NYC boroughs (Manhattan, Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island) using the census
data [12], the curve of daily new infections [11], and the corresponding proportions of
hospitalizations and deaths depending on age classes, by borough.
The estimation of the parameters is performed by minimizing a log-posterior density
with a gradient-descent technique. Bootstrap sampling is used to test parameters sensitivity as well as to provide 90% confidence intervals [10].

Main Findings After smoothing out the daily curves through 7-days moving averages,
we estimate the model parameters. The predicted curve by the model for daily new infections has good adherence to the averaged data curve. Furthermore, the predictions of
hospitalizations and deaths match well the reported values based on NYC data and its
4

boroughs.
We observe a dramatic change in the pattern of disease transmission on 19-Mar-2020,
identifying the effectiveness of containment measures imposed a week earlier, when a state
of emergency was declared and people were asked to stay home. We can also observe a
considerable drop of the time-dependent transmission coefficient and the time-dependent
basic reproduction rate (obtained via the next-generation matrix technique [14]). We also
noticed this phenomenon in the dynamics of the time-dependent transmission coefficients
associated to the NYC boroughs.
When analysing the datasets, the patterns of daily hospitalizations and deaths changed
consistently between the end of February and the end of August, especially the rate of hospitalization, which has decreased systematically since the end of March. To account for this
feature, we allow the model rates of hospitalization and death to be time-dependent.This
produces model predictions adherent to the datasets.
Short-term forecasts, with calibrated parameters, were also tested in two different situations, namely, during the transmission regime change and after the spread containment.
In both cases, the model predicted accurately the observed scenarios.
Moreover, different reopening scenarios were simulated, considering the impacts of reopening the entire NYC, the Staten Island only, or schools only. In all such cases, unless
strict social distance measures were kept, model predictions indicate new infection waves
that affect the population of the entire city (Figs. 5-7). Such findings are corroborated
by recent news, with new infection waves identified in Europe, New Zealand, and China
[3, 28, 16], as well as the reports of Covid-19 spread amongst youth population on an
overnight camp in Georgia (United States) and at schools in Israel [31, 25].

Materials and Methods

This section presents the epidemiological model and the procedure to estimate the model
parameters from the reported data.

2.1

The Epidemiological Model

The SEIR-type model considered here accounts for disease severity, age ranges, gender,
and geographic distribution of some pre-defined group or population. For simplicity, we
postpone the inclusion of gender and (spatial) location dependence to the end of the present
section. A number n of age ranges is assumed, each one represented by the superscript
5

i = 1, . . . , n and distributed in seven epidemic compartments: susceptible (S i ), exposed
i
but not yet infective (E i ), infective in mild conditions (IM
), infective in severe condition or
i
hospitalized (IH
), infective in critical condition or in an intensive care unit (ICU), denoted
i
by II , recovered (Ri ), and deceased (Di ). Following [32], we assume the following forms are
synonyms: in severe condition and hospitalized. The same applies for the forms in critical
conditions and in ICU. Each individual in the first two infective compartments, mildly
infective (M ) and hospitalized (H), can recover, die, or develop a more severe disease
outcome. Those ones in ICU can only recover or die.
To describe the model, we introduce the following notation: Define the vector
S = [S 1 , . . . , S n ]T ,
where the superscript T denotes the transposed vector, and similarly for E, IM , IH , II , R,
and D. Define also the tensor product:
x : y = [x1 y1 , x2 y2 , . . . , xn yn ]T .
Then, the epidemiological model can be written as:

The schematic representation of the model in Eqs. (1)-(7) can be seen in can be seen in
Fig. 1.
The matrices βM , βH , and βI contain the transmission parameters for the infective
individuals in the mild, hospitalized, and ICU classes, respectively. Such parameters are
time-dependent and, if well calibrated, may be used to address the effectiveness of con6

tention measures, to verify changes in the transmission pattern, or yet to track the impact
of suspending lockdown. It is worth mentioning that, depending on the information available, simplifying assumptions on the structure of such matrices must be made. In our
study, βM , βH , and βI assume the following form:
βM = β(t) B, βH = aβM , and βI = bβM ,

β(t) is a time-dependent scalar parameter that controls the epidemic dynamics, and the
parameters a and b are scale factors between 0 and 1. The matrix B depends on 2n − 1
parameters, namely, the vectors a = [a1 , . . . , an ]T , which contains the observed rates of
infections in the n age ranges reflecting the observed heterogeneity of the infectiousness
of Covid-19 into the model, and b = [b1 , . . . , bn−1 ]T , which addresses the mixing between
different age ranges and shall be estimated from the available data. The n-dimensional
vectors νM , νH , and νI contain the recovery rate for each age range in the infective classes
M , H, and I, respectively. Similarly, µM , µH , and µI contain the mortality rate for mild,
hospitalized, and in ICU infective individuals. The mean time of incubation is 1/σ. The
rates γM and γH stand for the hospitalization and ICU admission, respectively.
7

The rates of recovery, mortality, hospitalization, and ICU admission are inversely proportional to the corresponding mean times of disease evolution and directly proportional
to the probabilities of moving on to other compartments. All the quantities defining such
rates are based on the results of references [8, 19, 20, 21, 11, 26, 32, 35, 38].
The time-dependent transmission parameters βM , βH , and βI , as well as the initial
number of infective cases, are unknowns and shall be estimated from the recorded data of
daily new infections. Available census data is used to determine the population size and
the proportions of susceptible population on each age range.
Moreover, whenever the data from daily reports of new cases (infections, hospitalizations, and deaths) include different age ranges, the model can be generalized to incorporate
such information. In this case, the entries of βM are as follows:

Bij i
β (t) + β j (t) , i 6= j,
2
j
with β (t), j = 1, . . . , n, time-dependent scalar coefficients, and Bij the entries of the matrix
B defined above. The other transmission parameters are still of the form βH = aβM and
βI = bβM .
[βM ]jj = β j (t)Bjj , [βM ]ij =

Since for the NYC datasets only the accumulated numbers of infections, hospitalizations and deaths are age structured, we assume that the daily reported cases are not age
structured. To introduce more realistic death and hospitalization rates, we adjust µI and
γM by appropriate delayed ratios from daily reports. More precisely, if γ M and µI represent
the mean rates of hospitalization and death, respectively, for each age range i = 1, . . . , n,
i
the constant rates γM
and µiI are replaced, respectively, by

i
γM

and µiI

D̃(t)
,
˜
µI IH (t − τD )

where I˜M , I˜H , and D̃ represent the time series from daily reports of new infections, hospitalizations, and deaths, respectively. In addition, τM is the mean time of onset to hospitalization and τD is the mean time of hospitalization to death. We set τM = 1, approximating
the median value found in [26], and the parameter τD is set to τD = 1, obtained empirically
in the numerical tests. Notice that we are not considering the curves of daily reports of
ICU admissions, since this is not available in the NYC dataset.
8

Including Gender into the Model
Covid-19 affects male and female individuals differently. Depending on the age range,
the case fatality ratio is much larger for male individuals [5, 22]. To account for gender
variance into the model, the transmission parameters (βM , βH , and βI ) are generalized.
The transmission matrix for the mild class assumes the form:

and βM
are the transmission matrices for age ranges, defined above, for female

and male individuals, respectively. The transmission matrices βH and βI have the form
βH = aβM and βI = bβM .

Notice that the transmission between genders is accounted by the mean value of the
transmission inside genders. Intuitively, it means this means that a female individual that
keeps social distance with other females will also keep such containment measures with
male individuals. The same happens with male individuals.

Including Geographical Information
Monitoring and forecasting the disease spread and the effectiveness of containment measures in large regions, like metropolitan areas, states, and countries, are difficult tasks.
Heterogeneous distribution of population and differences in the implementation of social
restrictions may lead to quite different disease dynamics from place to place. Moreover,
people moving between regions can also cause new infection waves. Thus, to account for
these aspects, an epidemiological model must include the population’s geographical distribution. A number of approaches have been proposed and a review on this subject can be
found in [23]. Among them, SEIR-type models have been recurrently used to describe the
dynamics of human infectious diseases with geographical information. For example, [17, 7]
describe the Covid-19 dynamics in the United States counties and in Italy, respectively.
In order to include the geographical distribution of the population into the model
described by Eqs. (1)-(7), we enlarge the transmission matrices. By indexing each site
l
l
under consideration by l = 1, . . . , m, let βM
, βH
, and βIl be the corresponding transmission
matrices. Then, the transmission matrix for mildly infective individuals in the model
becomes:

l
is the matrix defining the transmission matrix βM
, for the l-th location. The transmission
matrices for the other infective classes are similar.
This choice for the matrix that represents the mixture of infective populations from
different locations helps to simplify the model, reducing considerably the number of unknowns, thus making calibration easier. In addition, the model structure is data driven
in the sense that it depends on the current information, thus reflecting more precisely
population behavior under different contention measures.
When dealing with large places, like states and countries, it is worth to add to the
model the distance between places by using exponential, Gaussian, or power law functions
[23]. Due to the interconnectedness of NYC and its boroughs, we prefer to estimate the
transmission-matrix components from the reported data.

2.2

Estimation Procedure

For simplicity, we start by presenting the estimation procedure for the model without
gender or geographical dependence. Moreover, the data on new infections, new hospitalizations, and new deaths released by the NYC authorities do not include gender or
age-ranges. Thus, we shall use this simpler version of the model, where β M = β(t)B. In
addition, to simplify the estimation, the constants a and b, related to the transmission matrices of hospitalized and in ICU individuals, are empirically set as a = 0.1 and b = 0.01,
respectively.
In order to estimate the model parameters from publicly available curves of daily new
infections, we build the so-called posterior distribution relating parameters to data.
We assume the number of daily new infective cases, denoted by I, is Poisson-distributed
P
with parameter σ ni=1 E i (t). Thus, denoting the vector of model parameters by θ, the
logarithm of the likelihood function is

where N is the number of samples in the data and the log(I!) is approximated by the
Stirling’s formula
1
log(2πI) + I log(I) − I.
2
We also assume that the vector of parameters θ is Gaussian-distributed with the mean
given by some vector of suitably chosen a priori parameters, denoted by θ0 , and identity covariance matrix. Thus, the negative of the logarithm of the posterior distribution
lP (θ|I, θ0 ) satisfies
α
(11)
lP (θ|I, θ0 ) ∝ L(θ|I) + kθ − θ0 k2 .
2
The constant α is the so-called regularization parameter in the context of Tikhonovtype regularization methods [15]. The estimated parameters are obtained by minimizing
lP (θ|I, θ0 ).
log(I!) ≈

We estimate the initial proportion of mild infective individual on each age range as
follows:
1
n
IM (0) = [IM
(0), . . . , IM
(0)]T ≈ IM,0 [p1 , . . . , pn ]T ,
where IM,0 is a scalar and pi is the population fraction of infective individuals on the i-th
age range. The latter is estimated from census data. Thus, the vector of parameters to be
estimated assumes the form:
θ = [IM,0 , β(t), b1 , . . . , bn−1 ]T ,

(12)

where the values of bj , j = 1, . . . , n − 1, correspond to the entries of the matrix B in
Eq. (9). The time-dependent transmission coefficient β(t) also appears in the definition of
βM .
The estimation of θ proceeds as follows:

1. Assume that β(t) is constant, and estimate θ from the set of daily reports of new
infections;
11

2. Estimate β(t) for each tj in the dataset by minimizing the following functional:

The estimation of the model with geographical information goes as follows: Consider the
m-dimensional time series of daily new reported infections from m different places, where
I l , l = 1, . . . , m, denotes the set of reports for the l-th place. For each l, let θl and
β l (t) denote the vector of parameters and the time-dependent transmission coefficient,
respectively, of the l-th place. We estimate the set of parameters Θ = [θ1 , . . . , θm ] and the
~ = [β 1 (t), . . . , β m (t)]T , by minimizing the log-posterior densities below:

where lP (θl |I l , θ0l ) and F (β l (tj+1 )|β l (tj ), θl , I l (tj+1 )) are given by (11) and (13), respectively. The computational cost of estimating this model varies with the number m of sites
considered. Based on the available computational resources, for large m, it may be worth
to simplify the model by reducing the number of age ranges or merging sites into a larger
one, thus reducing the model’s dimension.
We implemented the model’s solution and the estimation procedures in MATLAB® .
The code is available upon request. The optimization of the posterior density was performed by the general-purpose gradient-based algorithm LSQNONLIN from MATLAB® ’s
Optimization Toolbox.

Results: Estimation, Backtesting, and Forecasting

We start by evaluating the accuracy of the proposed methodology on fitting real data.
Then, we do back-testing of the estimated results with out-of-sample data for periods of 7
and 20 days. Finally, we perform a forecast analysis under different scenarios.
Our results are based on New York City reports of new infections, hospitalizations,
and deaths. This dataset is updated daily and it contains information about the disease
distribution at the five NYC boroughs with age-structured accumulated numbers [11].
12

As the number of daily Covid-19 tests have been increasing in NYC and more effective
treatments have been tested [34], the rates of new hospitalizations and new deaths have
been decreasing, in comparison to the rates of new infections. In order to account for all
these features, the rates used in the model were updated.

3.1

Estimation Results

Our initial example set does not consider geographical dependence yet. Such information
shall be incorporated along Subsection 3.2. The disease dynamics is estimated from the
number of daily new infections in the entire NYC area. The data series goes from 29-Feb2020 to 21-Aug-2020 and comes from publicly available data in [11]. This source provides
Covid-19 case reports and statistics for NYC and each of its five boroughs. The populations
of NYC and of its boroughs is distributed in the 5 age ranges present in the datasets. The
population distribution on age ranges and boroughs is based on the census data publicly
available at [12]. The curves of daily reports of new infections were smoothed-out by a
moving average of seven consecutive days. The rates per 100,000 inhabitants were used
to define the various model parameters. They include the hospitalization, recovery, and
death rates, as well as the vector a in the definition of the transmission matrices.
After preliminary calibration tests, two disease evolution regimes were clearly identified.
In the first one, the number of infective individuals increased exponentially and, in the
second one, the spread was considerably reduced due to the contention measures imposed
by the state of emergency declared on 12-Mar-2020. The effect of such intervention was
clearly observed in the evolution of the time-dependent transmission coefficient β(t) on
19-Mar-2020 (Fig. 2).
In order to capture possible regime changes, like the different age-range mixing, we
divided the time-series into two parts, namely data before and after 19-Mar-2020. For these
two time series subsets, we estimate the vector of parameters θ and the time-dependent
β. Note that, for the second dataset, after 19-Mar-2020, we do not estimate the initial
infective population. The estimated parameters and the corresponding 90% confidence
intervals (CIs) can be found in Tab. 1. Such intervals were obtained by excluding the 5%
largest and smallest values generated by 200 bootstrap samples [10]. Figure 2 presents the
comparison between reported and model predicted curves for daily new infections. The
time evolution of the basic reproduction rate can be found in Fig. 2. Table 2 depicts the
predicted and reported number of infections, hospitalizations, and deaths for 21-Aug-2020
with 90% CIs.

In Tab. 1, the estimated values of β were far from each other in both periods, which
indicates the aforementioned change in the transmission regime. Concerning the vector b,
after contention, the estimated values decrease consistently, indicating that the interaction
between age ranges was also significantly reduced. All these results show that, after 19Mar-2020, disease spread was contained. However, as we shall see later on, new infection
waves can occur if contention measures are relaxed.
Figure 2 shows the adherence of the calibrated model predictions to the 7-day moving
average of the reported number of new infections. The hospitalization and death rates
were evaluated using the ratios of reported data defined previously. The proportions of ICU
admissions by age were obtained in [8] and they were adjusted according to the proportions
of deaths available in [11]. The model accuracy is also illustrated in Tab. 2, where we can

range and gender.

deaths, for each age range and gender, are close to the reported ones.
As Fig. 2 clearly shows, the time-dependent basic reproduction rate R(t) has two different levels. Before 19-Mar-2020, it presents large values, indicating that the disease was
spreading without control. After 19-Mar-2020, the transmission parameter value drops to
around one, which indicates control of transmission by contention measures imposed from
12-Mar-2020 onwards. Notice that, the large values for the basic reproduction rate in the
first part of the series, i.e., before 19-Mar-2020, might be caused by an accumulation of
reports in the beginning of the outbreak. Such accumulation can be related, for example,
to difficulties faced by the health authorities to setup an appropriate diagnosis protocol.
The adherence of the calibrated model predictions to reported data, the accuracy in
the number of hospitalizations and deaths, as well as the behavior of the calibrated parameters indicating the effect of disease contention measures for NYC data show that our
proposed model captures well the Covid-19 dynamics in NYC. Therefore, it is useful to
track the spread dynamics, allowing to assess the effects of, for example, travel quarantine,
social distancing, and reopening strategies. If infection curves for different age ranges are
15

available, it is possible to use the present model to track aspects like the effects of reopening schools, universities, or yet parks and public gardens, since these spaces are usually
frequented by people of well defined age ranges. Thus, it is easier to track the disease
spread dynamics more accurately, allowing the decision of whether additional reopening or
further restrictions could be taken.

Including Geographical Information

Let us consider the epidemiological dynamics of the five boroughs of NYC, namely, Queens,
Manhattan, Staten Island, Brooklyn, and Bronx. The data was downloaded from [11] on
02-July-2020.
The calibrated model predictions of daily new infections and the corresponding timedependent transmission coefficients can be found in Fig. 3.

bottom rows are reported cases. Inside the parentheses are the 90% CIs.
Figure 3, among other things, shows the model predictions adherence to the curves of
reported daily new infections. Such accuracy is also attested by the comparison between
reports and predictions of the accumulated number of total infections, hospitalizations,
and deaths for 01-July-2020 in Tab. 3.
The behavior of the time-dependent transmission coefficient for each borough is similar
to the basic reproduction rate R(t) in the previous example. This behavior is expected
since transmission contention measures were taken since 12-Mar-2020 in the entire NYC.
This example shows the ability of the present model to detect disease transmission
patterns in different locations at the same moment. The model also accounts for the

interaction between individuals from different age ranges, genders, and locations. With
such features, it is possible to track the implications of reopening, the necessity of additional
17

contention measures, or yet auxiliating the design of vaccination strategies. Such broad
applications could not be achieved via simpler models.

3.3

Backtesting

In order to test short-term forecast capabilities of the model, we consider two different
periods of the Covid-19 outbreak in NYC.
Uncontained Spread
We calibrate the parameters with data from reports on new infections in the period from
29-Feb-2020 to 19-Mar-2020 and we produce a seven-day forecast starting on 20-Mar-2020.
This forecasted period is of particularly interest since on 19-Mar-2020 the disease spread
pattern changed considerably due to the contention measures undertaken 7 days earlier,
as a consequence of the state of emergency declared on 12-Mar-2020. To generate the
predictions, we assume that β(t) is constant for dates t after 19-Mar-2020 and that it takes
the same value as the one estimated on 19-Mar-2020.

Figure 4: Predictions for the daily reported new infections (left), new hospitalizations
(center), and new deaths (right) for the periods 19 to 24-Mar-2020 (top row) and 24-July2020 to 12-Aug-2020 (botton row). The solid lines represent the model predictions with
best fit and the bars that depict the reported NYC data. On the right side of the dashed
lines are the model forecasts. The filled envelopes are the 90% CIs.
Figure 4 presents a comparison between the forecasted curves and the reported data.
Although the parameters were estimated with information based on uncontrolled disease
spread, the 7-day ahead forecast for daily new infections and new hospitalizations starting on 20-Mar-2020 are satisfactorily accurate. The accumulated number of infections,
hospitalizations, and deaths for the forecasted period can be found in Tab. 4.
18

Contained Spread
We now create a forecast for the period 24-July-2020 to 12-Aug-2020. For dates t after
23-July-2020, the time-dependent values of the transmission coefficient are given by the
mean of values for the period from 13 to 23-July-2020.
Figure 4 presents a comparison between the predicted and the reported data for the
forecasted period. Table 4 presents the predicted and the reported values of accumulated
infections, hospitalizations, and deaths from 24-July-2020 to 12-Aug-2020.

predictions while bottom rows are the reported cases. Between parentheses are the 90%
CIs.
As Fig. 4 and Tab. 4 show, the model predictions of infections, hospitalizations, and
deaths are once again satisfactorily accurate. These results are explained by the model
ability to incorporate the disease dynamics through the time-dependent parameters. Notice that, in these examples, the rates of hospitalizations and deaths are evaluated using
appropriate ratios of reported data, defined previously, until the last day of estimation.
In the forecasted period, we repeat the rates for the days 19-Mar-2020 and 23-July-2020,
respectively, for the corresponding data ranges studied.

3.4

Reopening Scenarios

We now apply the calibrated models from the previous sections to a number of plausible
scenarios, such as the reopening of the entire NYC region, of schools, and of just one single
borough, which we chose to be Staten Island. The predictions for those scenarios will give
us an idea of the predictive capability of our model.
The Entire NYC
The aim of this example is to present possible scenarios for the Covid-19 epidemic for long
periods without an effective vaccine or appropriate treatment. We consider two different
19

situations. In the first one, the transmission parameters stay at the level of strict containment, what was observed in the period from 04 to 14-June-2020. Thus, for any date t after
14-June-2020, the transmission coefficient β(t) is set as the mean for the estimated values
of β(t) on the period from 04 to 14-June-2020, i.e., β(t) = 1.77 with 90% CI 0.27–4.69.
In the second case, we simulate a controlled reopening, by allowing the coefficient β(t) to
reach the double of the values obtained in the previous case, i.e., β(t) = 3.54 (0.53–9.38).
However, if we impose that whenever the number of daily new infections reaches 1000
cases, containment measures are undertaken, forcing β(t) to return to lower levels until
it reaches the value 1.77 (0.27–4.69). On the other hand, after undertaking containment
measures, if the number of daily new infections is below 200 cases, we permit reopening,
and β(t) may grow again until it reaches the value 3.54 (0.53–9.38).

Figure 5: Model predictions of daily new infections for reopening scenarios. Left: containment measures are kept during the whole period. Center: Reopening is allowed until the
daily number of new infections reaches 1000 or if it is below 200 (horizontal dashed lines).
Right: Reopening schools. The filled envelopes represent the 90% CIs.
Figure 5 (left and center panels) present the curves of daily new infections for the aforementioned scenarios. Before 14-June-2020, we have the estimated curves. The forecasting
goes from 15-June-2020 to 11-May-2021. According to this example, the reopening without
an effective vaccine or the achievement of herd immunity may bring new infection waves,
even when the number of daily new cases is relatively low.
Reopening Schools
To simulate a controlled reopening of schools from 15-June-2020, we use the set of parameters estimated after 19-Mar-2020. In order to artificially increase the interaction between
school-age individuals, the entries of the transmission matrix βM associated to the mildly
infective individuals in the age range 0 to 17 years old are multiplied by 2.5. In addition,
the time-dependent transmission coefficient is set to 1.25 times the mean of the estimated
values for the period 06 to 15-June-2020. For this specific age range, the transmission
parameter values are similar to the ones obtained for the period before 19-Mar-2020. This
20

is expected, since controlling the mixing in youth population at schools is difficult. Indeed,
recent news indicates that Covid-19 transmission rate amongst people under 19 years old
is similar to transmission rate in other age ranges [25, 31].
Figure 5 (right panel) presents model predictions of this “safe” reopening. Notice that,
whenever the number of daily new infections reaches 1000 cases, contention measures are
imposed again. Reopening occurs if the number of daily new cases would fall below 200.
Therefore, even under an idealized situation, reopening schools may cause new infection
waves among the entire population. Thus, monitoring transmission dynamics is of fundamental importance to set the right time for relaxing or tightening contention measures.
In Israel, the recent reopening of schools caused a secondary wave of new infections that
forced the adoption of new contention measures [25].
Reopening Staten Island
Two different scenarios are considered in this example: reopening Staten Island with and
without restrictive measures. In the first one, contention measures are slightly relaxed,
without allowing people from different age ranges and boroughs to interact. Quantitatively,
we keep the same parameter values estimated in the period 19-Mar-2020 onwards. The
only change is in the transmission coefficient for Staten Island, which is set as the double
of the mean of the corresponding estimated values of β(t) for the period 22-June-2020 to
01-July-2020, for dates t after 01-July-2020. During the forecasted period (02-Jul-2020 to
29-Oct-2020), the transmission coefficients for the other boroughs are kept equal to the
mean of the estimated values for the period 22-June-2020 to 01-July-2020.
In the second scenario, people from different boroughs and age ranges are allowed to
interact, keeping some social distance and simple containment measures. Only in Staten
Island, simple containment measures are undertaken. In other words, the time-independent
transmission parameters assume the same values estimated in the period 29-Feb-2020 to
19-Mar-2020. In addition, we allow the time-dependent transmission coefficient for Staten
Island to reach the double of the mean of the estimated values for the period 22-June-2020
to 01-July-2020, for dates t after 01-July-2020. Again, after 01-July-2020, the transmission
coefficients for the other boroughs are kept equal to the mean of the estimated values for the
period 22-June-2020 to 01-July-2020. Whenever the number of daily new infections reaches
1000 in NYC, contention measures are undertaken again. So, the time-independent transmission parameters are brought back to the same values of the period after 19-Mar-2020
and the transmission coefficient for Staten Island is reset to the mean of the correspond21

ing estimated values for the period 22-June-2020 to 01-July-2020. Reopening reoccurs
whenever the number of daily new infections in NYC is below 100 reports.

The filled envelopes represent the 90% CIs.

Figure 7: Model predictions of daily new infections for the period 02-July-2020 to 29Oct-2020 in NYC, when lockdown is lifted, with light containment measures. The filled
envelopes represent the 90% CIs.
Figures 6-7 present the curves of daily new infections for the first and second scenarios, respectively. They show the evolution for each borough and for the entire NYC. In
the first case, doubling the mean of the transmission coefficient alone is not sufficient to
cause secondary waves of infection. In other words, if restriction of movement between
boroughs are kept and the interaction between age ranges stay contained, through strict
social distance measures, infection will not return and the disease outbreak will die out.
On the other hand, reopening a borough and allowing people of different ages and from
different boroughs to interact, although keeping some light containment and social distance
measures, can cause new waves of infection for large periods.
22

Discussion

We use a 7-day moving average to perform smoothing of data. After calibration, the
model predictions were adherent to the data of daily new infections and they predicted
well the number of daily new hospitalizations and deaths. The adjustment of the rates of
hospitalization and death using appropriate ratios of reported data contributed to improving model predictions. While backtesting, forecasts for few days ahead, under different
contexts, turned out to be accurate. The model identified well the effects of lockdown
undertaken in NYC after 12-Mar-2020. A considerable change in the values of the transmission rates was noticed. This flattened the curve and kept the number of daily new
infections low, as shown in [11].
The rates of hospitalizations and deaths were smaller by the end of August than in
earlier periods of the Covid-19 outbreak in NYC. This phenomenon may be caused by
changes in disease virulence or in the protocols used to address Covid-19, like smaller
onset to hospitalization meantime, more precise Covid-19 diagnosis, or the introduction of
more effective treatments [34]. Moreover, in NYC, the number of Covid-19 daily tests has
been increasing consistently since the beginning of the outbreak in the end of February2020. To account for such changes in the aforementioned rates, the corresponding model
parameters were adjusted using ratios of reported data, incorporating this feature. This
increased considerably the accuracy of the model predictions of hospitalizations and deaths,
as the results show (Fig. 2 and Tab. 1).
Concerning reopening strategies, some simulated scenarios generated with calibrated
parameters indicate that there is no completely safe way of reopening schools, boroughs,
or the entire city unless people respect strict protocols of social distance, avoiding direct
personal contact. As model predictions show, even when only a borough or only schools are
reopened, new infection waves may occur, forcing public authorities to establish contention
measures again. While infective individuals are present in a population, there is the risk
of new infection waves in reopening strategies, since it is not possible to guarantee that
everyone will respect the protocols of contention. Such phenomenon was recently seen
in the news [25, 16]. Thus, reopening must be undertaken with strict control of disease
transmission, while applying massive testing and enforcing social distance measures.
Despite the fact that the role of children and teenagers in Covid-19 spread is still
unknown, some recent events of disease spread amongst youth population in an overnight
camp in Georgia [31] and in schools in Israel [25] indicate that, although most individuals
present mild symptoms, they can infect other people. So, reopening schools also represents
23

a risk of new infection waves.
Even New Zealand and China, that successfully contained Covid-19 spread and had
long periods without registering community transmission, are now facing new cases [3, 28].
All these news corroborate our model predictions, suggesting that, without strict control
of Covid-19 through social distance or after massive and effective vaccination, a completely
safe reopening may be impossible.
It is worth mentioning that, the present model is also suited to simulate and analyze vaccination strategies appropriately, since it addresses dependency on age and spatial
distribution. This possibility shall be addressed in a forthcoming article.

Tracking the Reopening of NYC
On May 2020, the State of New York initiated a four-phase reopening program. NYC
joined the fourth phase on 20-July-2020. By 22-Aug-2020, schools and shopping malls
were still closed, yet public transportation and a number of economic activities were already operational [18, 30]. Strict social distancing measures were still enforced and public
authorities were following closely their observance. This kept the number of daily new
infections stable.
Figure 2 shows the Covid-19 situation in NYC until 21-Aug-2020. The panel presents
the comparison of model predictions and reports of daily new infections, as well as the
time-dependent basic reproduction rate R(t). Observe that since 19-Mar-2020, R(t) stays
around one, meaning the disease transmission is under control, but not eradicated, and that
new infection waves may still occur. Even after reaching the fourth phase of controlled
reopening, NYC authorities managed to keep transmission under control through social
distancing measures, by limiting the operational capacity of numerous services, disinfecting
public transportation, and many other practices.
Notice that, even if Covid-19 is eradicated in NYC, while no effective vaccine is ready
to be used in the entire globe, contention measures inside NYC must be kept to avoid new
outbreaks caused by the reintroduction of the disease from abroad.

Concluding Remarks

SEIR-type models have been proposed by a number of authors to predict qualitative aspects
of the dynamics of infectious diseases in general, and of the Covid-19 pandemic in particular. See [4] for a recent account of the SIR models and its connections to other models. Yet,
24

to address the elusive aspects of the complex human interactions within the terrain, we
feel that one has to forego parsimonious models. Functional and high-dimensional models
have been used in a number of areas ranging from Financial Mathematics to Population
Dynamics [1, 27]. They are directly connected with the mathematical theory of Inverse
Problems [29, 7, 6, 15]. The present article explores several aspects of infectious diseases,
including Covid-19, that have been receiving little attention in the recent literature. We
consider time-dependent rates of transmission, hospitalization, and deaths, as well as the
disease age- and gender-dependent severity and transmission, while taking in account the
spatial distribution of population.
The model was extensively tested with real data from NYC and its boroughs. After
calibration, it matched the curves of daily new infections and provided accurate predictions
for the number of daily hospitalizations and deaths. It also properly detected the change in
the transmission pattern on 19-Mar-2020 caused by contention measures taken on 12-Mar2020. Moreover, it illustrated the stabilization of the time-dependent basic reproduction
rate around the value 1 in NYC.
Concerning prediction of new infections, the model was also evaluated while using
real data and calibrated parameters. It generated accurate results under controlled and
uncontrolled transmission contexts. Moreover, different scenarios as reopening of schools
and of an entire borough of NYC were illustrated. In both cases, transmission rates
increased considerably, demanding new contention measures. In other words, without
reaching herd immunity or the complete disease eradication, we can always face the risk
of new infection waves.
Our proposed model is sufficiently general to track transmission dynamics with dependence on age range, gender, and spatial distribution, while evaluating the disease impact
on the population. Thus, it is a powerful tool to evaluate scenarios and to build proper
vaccination strategies.
