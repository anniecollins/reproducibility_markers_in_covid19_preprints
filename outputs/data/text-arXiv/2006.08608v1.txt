Abstract
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel virus of beta
coronavirus genus originated in Wuhan, China in December 2019, resulted in the
pandemic spread of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) worldwide. This genus
also contains SARS-CoV (originated in China 2002-2003) and MERS-CoV (found in
Saudi Arabia 2012). The nucleotide sequences of SARS-CoV-2 is closer to SARS-CoV
(with approximately 80% identity) than to MERS-CoV. Despite these similarities,
SARS-CoV-2 has two main features over the other coronaviruses. The first is the high
contagious rate and the second is the immune response evasion. The higher
transmission ability makes this virus quickly spread worldwide with a high mortality
rate and more economic losses. This review will provide an overview of the current
knowledge on the role of some viral and host cell factors in higher transmission and
contagious spread of SARS-CoV-2.
Keywords: Furin site; Receptor binding motif; CD147 receptor; Pericyte; Extracellular
vesicle.
Introduction
Although no current accurate available data explain SARS-CoV-2 higher transmission
and contagious spread, herein I speculated about 5 possible factors: 1) furin cleavage
site in the spike protein (SP), 2) mutated receptor binding motif (RBM) of SP, 3) new
receptor (CD147), 4) new target (pericytes), and 5) new entry route (extracellular
vesicles, EV). The first 2 are virus-related factors and the remaining are host-related
factors. Away from the conspiracy theory, I consider these 5 factors as pieces that were
1

assembled by an unknown hand to create SARS-CoV-2 similar to the creation of
Frankenstein monster (Fig.1).
Furin site piece
Before binding with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, SP of SARSCoV-2 should be cleaved by protease enzymes into the S1 domain (responsible for
ACE2 binding) and the S2 domain (responsible for virus-cell membrane fusion)
(Hoffmann et al., 2020). Three host protease enzymes are involved in S priming,
including furin, trypsin, and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). Unlike
SARS-CoV SP, SARS-CoV-2 SP can be cleaved by all these enzymes (Coutard et al.,
2020; Hoffmann et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020; Yuanchen et al., 2020). Another protease,
cathepsin B/L (CTSB/L) also participates in SARS-CoV-2 entry (via endosomal
pathway) especially in the upper respiratory tract (Sungnak et al., 2020). Interestingly,
furin-mediated cleavage could provide a 100-fold higher efficient infection than other
protease enzymes do (Matsuyama et al., 2005) and so this can explain the higher affinity
for SARS-CoV-2 to enter cells relative to SARS-CoV (Li et al., 2020; Yuanchen et al.,
2020). Notably, S protein of the infectious bronchitis virus (IBVs) Beaudette strain also
contains furin cleavage site, which correlates with higher infection ability of IBVBeaudette as compared to other IBV strains (Yamada and Liu, 2009). Additionally, the
profuse expression of ACE2, furin, and TMPRSS2 in the lining epithelia of the upper
respiratory tract enables SARS-CoV-2 replication in the upper respiratory tract before
shedding to the lung and suggests its enhanced transmission (Yuanchen et al., 2020).
The wide distribution of furin in most tissues of the body enhances the SARS-CoV-2
replication in non-respiratory organs such as intestine, kidney, and heart which could
also explain the multiple symptoms of COVID-19 and multi-organs dysfunction in late
stages (Hua et al., 2020). The perfect insertion of the furin cleavage site (9 inserted
nucleotides coding 3 amino acids) in receptor binding domain of SP gene (at S1/S2
interface) makes scientists think in laboratory synthesis theory of SARS-CoV-2
(Coutard et al., 2020) but to date no scientific proof for this theory.
RBM piece
Some non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) changed some amino
acids and led to conformational changes in RBD of SP in a way that makes its binding
with ACE2 very strong (Hua et al., 2020; Shang et al., 2020). Studying the crystal
2

structure of RBD of the two SARS viruses using cryo-electron microscopy revealed a
very stronger binding between SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 receptors than SARS-CoV
does (Wrapp et al., 2020). This binding also showed a clear conformational change in
the main loop of the complex binding interface. Some researchers accept this theory
that argues for the natural origin of the virus due to selective/adaptive mutations from
a wild host (bat) to humans. However, this stronger receptor binding is not enough to
fully clarify the more contagious rate.
CD147 piece
CD147 (also known as Basigin) is a transmembrane glycoprotein that acts as an
extracellular matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inducer. CD147 can act as a receptor,
alternative to ACE2, for SP of SARS-CoV (Chen et al., 2005) and SARS-CoV-2 (Wang
et al., 2020b) to enter the host cells. The anti-CD147 antibody Meplazumab has the
potential to block the binding of SP and CD147 and arrest cell entry, which offers a
potential opportunity for developing effective treatment or vaccine targeting CD147
receptor (Wang et al., 2020b). This monoclonal antibody is now using under a clinical
trial in China (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04275245). Interestingly, CD147 was
also abundantly expressed in RBCs and act as a receptor for Plasmodium falciparum
that causes Malaria in humans (Crosnier et al., 2011). However, it is unknown whether
SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to this receptor on RBCs. To date, no proof for infection of
RBCs by SARS-CoV-2 or even other related coronaviruses. This important topic could
be addressed in the next investigations. Only, one in silico study found that three nonstructural proteins (orf1ab, ORF10, and ORF3a) can compete with iron to bind with
porphyrin (Wenzhong and Hualan, 2020). However, this binding was not confirmed yet
by in vivo or in vitro studies.
Diabetic patients have a higher expression of CD147 and its downstream target
MMP1 and MMP9 (Ulrich and Pillat, 2020). This may explain why diabetic patients
constitute a high-risk group for COVID-10 morbidity, but further studies are required
to validate this possibility. The potential relive effect of azithromycin against COVID19 could be attributed to the blocking of CD147 receptor (Ulrich and Pillat, 2020),
however, this could first be experimentally confirmed. CD147 is extensively expressed
in brain pericytes and its ligand cyclophilin A (CypA) activates this expression (Pan et
al., 2020). On the other hand, cyclosporine A, as a CypA inhibitor, could inhibit the
3

binding of CypA with CD147 in pericytes (Pan et al., 2020). Intriguingly, the potent
immunosuppressive cyclosporine A drug can be used to reduce cytokine storm induced
by SARS-CoV-2 and probably to inhibit CD147 expression, but its use is restricted due
to its adverse effects (Cure et al., 2020)
Pericyte piece
Before corpus dissection by Italian scientists, all our attention was paid toward the
severe acute lung injury associated with COVID-19. However, after the post-mortem
examination (Magro et al., 2020), most physicians and scientists focused on
cardiovascular morbidities and started to include antithrombotic drugs in the treatment
protocol. Researchers looked for cellular components invaded by SARS-CoV-2
through determination which vascular cell expresses ACE2. There is a big debate
regarding the expression of ACE2 by endothelial cells. Some studies confirmed this
expression (Muus et al., 2020) and others excluded this expression and suggested the
presence of contamination by pericytes (He et al., 2020). Unlike endothelial cells,
pericytes (perivascular cells wrapped the endothelial cells and enclosed by the same
basement membrane) expressed the ACE2 receptor. In the COVID-19-pericyte
hypothesis postulated by He et al. (2020), targeting pericytes, instead of endothelial
cells, by SARS-CoV-2 is the main cause for multiple thromboses which subsequently
lead to death in high-risk people including diabetic, hypertensive, and obese. According
to this theory, this high-risk group has a defective endothelial barrier (damaged junction
complex between endothelial cells) which permits SARS-CoV-2 to reach the
peripherally located pericytes and binds to their ACE2 receptors. Damage of pericytes
(follow infection) could result in the induction of inflammation, cytokines storm, and
thrombosis (aggregation of platelets, fibrin deposition, increase in D-Dimer, VWF
protein, and factor VIII) which all reported in severe cases of COVID-19 (Becker, 2020;
He et al., 2020; Helms et al., 2020). Although, most diagnostic kits for SARS-CoV-2
depend on naso- and oro-pharyngeal swabs, the viral RNA was also detected in blood
and was used as a predictor for patient severity case (Chen et al., 2020b). Although
SARS-CoV-2 can invade and replicate in human microvascular organoids containing
pericytes (Monteil et al., 2020), further experiments are required to prove the ability of
SARS-CoV-2 to infect pericytes.

4

In the heart, a higher expression for ACE2 was also found in pericytes as
compared to other cellular subtypes (Chen et al., 2020a). In the lung, some complicated
cases of COVID-19 suffered from fibrosis (Wang et al., 2020a). One of the main
cellular sources for the developed myofibroblasts is the pericytes (Hung et al., 2013).
Interestingly, pericytes expressed not only ACE2 but also CD147 receptors (Ulrich and
Pillat, 2020), suggesting these cells as a more appropriate target for SARS-CoV-2.
In the kidney, pericytes located around either afferent arteriole of glomeruli or
capillaries between renal tubules and could give rise to podocytes, mesangial cells,
capillary smooth muscles, and fibroblast (Kurtz, 2016). Glomerular pericytes secrete
renin (which acts as barosensor) and interstitial pericytes secrete erythropoietin (which
acts as an oxygen sensor) (Stefanska et al., 2016). Both renin and erythropoietin play
an important role in the maintenance of blood pressure and volume. Interestingly, renal
pericytes also expressed ACE2 receptors, and severe cases of COVID-19 showed clear
nephropathy with a significant reduction of renin, aldosterone, and erythropoietin
(Rabb, 2020). I speculated that SARS-CoV-2 might infect renal pericytes causing their
damage which could lead to decrease renin, aldosterone, and erythropoietin serum level
and subsequently increase vascular leakage and hypoxia. This increased permeability
and leakage could also occur due to lower ACE2 activity that indirectly induces the
kallikrein–bradykinin pathway (Teuwen et al., 2020). Surprisingly, furin and its
downstream target membrane type-1 metalloprotease (MT1-MMP) are over-expressed
in podocytes, specialized form of pericytes, in diabetic rats (Boucher et al., 2006).
MMPs are also activated by CD147 (Ulrich and Pillat, 2020). However, it is unknown
whether CD147 and furin are co-expressed in pericytes.
It is worth to say that vascular damage precedes lung damage in COVID-19
patients (Becker, 2020; Helms et al., 2020). In support with early vascular damage,
most or even all infected cases showed symptoms of loss of smell and taste and this
was attributed to abundant co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in pericytes in the
olfactory bulb as well as basal and sustentacular cells in the olfactory mucosa,
suggesting a higher infection rate in these cells (Brann et al., 2020). For this important
role of pericytes in COVID-19 pathogenesis and the early vascular damage, I suggest
an alternative name for the virus which is severe acute vascular and respiratory
syndrome CoV (SAVRS-CoV).

5

EV piece
SARS-CoV-2 can escape from the initial host immune response (as indicated by
delayed type I interferon production), explaining the presence of asymptomatic carriers
(Prompetchara et al., 2020). SARS-CoV-2 could likely use other routes to be
transmitted from cell to cell and to evade from the immune response of infected cells.
Extracellular vesicles (EVs), including microvesicles and exosomes, which play an
important role in transmission and pathogenesis of some viruses such as HBV, HCV,
and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (Bukong et al., 2014; Chahar et al., 2018;
Devhare et al., 2017; Muus et al., 2020), could be one of these routes which may be
involved in SARS-Cov-2 transmission from cell to cell. In HCV, the virus escapes from
host cell innate immune response through encapsulating their dsRNAs (a viral IFN
inducer) within EVs (Grünvogel et al., 2018). The delayed secretion of type I interferon
in the case of COVID-19 could theoretically occur in the same way, but this needs
further investigations to practically prove this theory.
Biogenesis of EVs shares some cellular components (such as endosomes,
multivesicular bodies and lysosomes) that hijacked by virus after entrance into cell
(Chahar et al., 2018). EVs secreted from A549 lung epithelial cells infected with
lentivirus loaded with some SARS-CoV-2 genes were uptaken by human-induced
pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) (Kwon et al., 2020). The
viral genes also induced the expression of inflammation-related genes in hiPSC-CMs.
Moreover, exosomes derived from a cell culture system and patient’s sera with
complete replication of HCV genome showed an ability to transmit infection to normal
human hepatocytes (Bukong et al., 2014; Lindenbach et al., 2005). Exosomes can
activate immune response through induction of cytokine release during cytokine storm
associated with RSV infection (Chahar et al., 2018). Interestingly, the exosomes
isolated from the blood of hepatitis B patients contained protein and nucleic acids of
HBV and exosomal contents were also detected in the natural killer cells and
contributed to the suppression of immunity (Yang et al., 2017).
Conclusions
Every day we hear or read new information regarding SARS-CoV-2, but the only true
thing is that there is no appropriate treatment for COVID-19, and developing an
effective vaccine could take a long time. This virus resembles a Frankenstein monster
6

as it has many strange pieces giving it unique properties over those of previous
coronaviruses. In this review I discussed only 5 pieces, however, many other pieces
remained mysterious (Fig. 1). Our question is which hand assembled these pieces? Is
the hand of a scientist, God, or nature? Who wants to punish the world? Is this
Frankenstein monster assembled in the laboratory during a vaccine development trial
on bats and was disseminated unintendedly to people? Is this a message from God to
follow his guidelines for peace, safety, fairness, and justice? Is this a message from
nature to decrease pollution and maintain the ecosystem and green area? We have no
answer at this time, however, the next days could have suitable answers and then all
monster pieces could be discovered.
