Abstract—We introduce a new method for temporal pattern
analysis of scientific collaboration networks. We investigate in
particular virus research activities through five epidemic or
pandemic outbreaks in the recent two decades and in the
ongoing pandemic with COVID-19. Our method embodies two
innovative components. The first is a simple model of temporal
collaboration networks with time segmented in publication time
and convolved in citation history, to effectively capture and
accommodate collaboration activities at mixed time scales. The
second component is the novel use of graphlets to encode
topological structures and to detect change and persistence in
collaboration activities over time. We discover in particular two
unique and universal roles of bi-fork graphlet in (1) identifying
bridges among triangle clusters and (2) quantifying grassroots
as the backbone of every collaboration network. We present
a number of intriguing patterns and findings about the virusresearch activities.

I. I NTRODUCTION
We present a new approach for uncovering and analyzing
temporal patterns of author collaboration networks over different time periods. Author collaboration networks are among the
most studied over a half century [1]–[4]. We make three key
contributions. First, we introduce a live literature graph (LG)
we created in March 2020 [5] and have made frequent updates
since. The literature body is mainly on research of various
viruses, including HIV, SARS, Swine flu, MERS, Ebola,
Avian flu and the coronavirus responsible for the ongoing,
ravaging pandemic with COVID-19. The LG contains articles
that date back to 1744. For temporal pattern detection and
analysis, we extract 6 open citation networks over different
time windows, 6 related article-author bipartite graphs and
6 author collaboration networks. The basic information is in
Table 1. We apply our temporal analysis approach to these
networks and use them in turn as real-world network examples.
We describe the LG in Section II. Secondly we introduce
an original method for constructing author collaboration networks with time segmented in publication time and convolved
(overlapped) in citation history. This is a significant deviation
from conventional methods, in which temporal changes in data
was neglected in static analysis, or simplistically sliced by
time windows at a macroscopic scale, or regulated by timedependent models at a microscopic time scale. We describe
The first two authors contributed equally to this work.

graph, which is represented by the upper triangular adjacency matrix, with

It also includes two open components, block Cout composed of outward
links in one hop to precursor articles and block Cin composed of inward
links in one hop from follower articles. (b) The article-author bipartite with
the articles partitioned into Cout, Core and Cin subsets and the involved

Thirdly, we use graphlets as coding elements for encoding
topological structures and dynamic changes of live networks.
In Fig. 2 the first five generic graphlets are shown. Graphlets
are fundamental topology elements of all networks or graphs.
In concept, graphlets for network analysis are similar to

wavelets for spectro-temporal analysis of signal processing [6],
shapelets for time series classification [7], super-pixels for
image analysis [8], and n-grams for natural language processing [9], [10]. Network analysis using graphlets has advanced in recent years, since the original work by Pržulj et
al in 2004 [11]–[14]. Graphlets are mostly used for statistical characterization and modeling of entire networks. We
recently established a new way of using graphlets to encode
microscopic structure at vertex neighborhood to macroscopic
structure such as cluster configurations [15]. In this work,
we succeed in using graphlet encoding schemes to detect
changes and persistence across author collaboration networks
at different epochs, while the conventional approach based on
degree distributions is short of such differentiation capacity,
as shown in Fig. 4.
We present in Section V a few remarkable findings.
II. L IVE LITERATURE GRAPH : LG- COVID 19-HOTP
We introduce briefly a particular real-world literature graph,
LG-covid19-HOTP [5], created by three of the authors in
early March, released onto the Internet on March 26, 2020, and
updated weekly ever since.1 The literature body, centering on
virus research, is composed of COVID-19 scholarly articles,
their precursor and contemporary studies on viruses. Our data
collection starts with a set of seed articles (not a single ego
article) and makes backward (citing) and forward (being cited)
spans from several very large literature databases [16]. In
principle, the collection is by preferential attachment [17].
Detailed collection information can be found at the home
website. There are several other COVID-19 themed literature
datasets2 , some of them are absent of citation links.
We provide in Fig. 3 and Table 1 the basic quantitative
information of LG-covid19-HOTP. The number of articles
and the author population increase steadily, without noticeable
bursts. The dips in recent two years are due to update latency
in the databases our collection relies on. We expect, however,
a burst in 2020 by the current collection up to June.
Our temporal pattern analysis rests on recognizing and
exploring important properties of the literature graph.
LG-covid19-HOTP is of multiple attribute dimensions, or
a multiplex network. It has several types of vertices/nodes and
several types of edges/links. The primary nodes are articles;
the primary edges are citation links from citing articles to cited
articles. The adjacency matrix for the citation network among

articles (in blue) and the authors (in red) between 1960 and 2020-June, by the
records in LG-covid19-HOTP. The total number of authors is 551, 713,
more than twice the total number of articles, 251, 551. Observation: Both
annual counts increase steadily over time (the lower dips at 2018-19 are mostly
due to latency in data collection and registration). A burst is expected by the
end of 2020 given the current counts in less than 6 months.

Fig. 4: Degree (𝜎1 ) histograms for 6 collaboration networks associated with
the epochs specified in Table 1. The bin size is 4 except the last one that
includes all authors with degree above 800. The network associated with
COVID-19 is over a time window of only 6 months up to the present, 5
times as small as the 3-year periods for the others. The burst at 100, common
to all 6 histograms, is an artifact caused by the cutoff threshold at 100 set
by Scopus (and similarly by other data sources) over the number of authors
per article. The artifact is also manifested in Fig. 8 and explained in detail
there. Observation. All six degree distributions follow the power-law pattern.
A synthetic power law curve with parameter 𝛾 = 2.7 is provided and shown
in black to serve as a reference.

the article nodes is nearly upper triangular, where the articles
are ordered chronologically, the first row identifies with the
earliest article. We depict the citation adjacency matrix at
the top-left of Fig. 1. Although primary, the article nodes
are actually the results of actions by the author nodes. The
LG contains the bipartite between article nodes and author
nodes. An article is written by one or more authors; and
an author is connected to one or more articles. We depict
the bipartite incidence matrix at the top-right of Fig. 1. Via
the bipartite, we get author collaboration network/adjacency
matrix at the bottom-right of Fig. 1. Other nodes represent
author affiliations, author profiles, semantic entities in titles,
abstracts and text bodies, and data figures and tables.
More importantly, the LG is a live network, changing and
evolving incessantly, with growth and collectively selected
memory, not ephemeral nor static. However, author collaboration networks had been largely made static (by time integration). The publication timestamp with each article records
the birth time of the article, which may herald a new path or
trajectory. The bibliographical references are links to selected
precursor work in time as well as in concept. Some other

subtitles. In each matrix, the author vertices are first grouped by the septapartition and ordering of (b) and (c) in Fig. 1 as marked by white partition
lines; and then ordered within each cohort by combinatorial nested dissection
(CND) in order to reveal the sparse topology. The intra-collaboration in the
Core cohort (2) is marked by red boundary lines. A pixel in each display
represents a block matrix, as specified in the subtitle. The pixel color is
determined by the number of links within the block, in logarithmic scale. The
pixel in darker blue indicates a sparser block; in vibrant red, a denser block.
Observation: The Cout block (1) and Cin block (3) represent precursors and
followers, respectively. The Cout:Core ratio is small in SARS, larger in MERS,
and much larger in COVID-19. Reversely, the Cin:Core ratio is the largest
in SARS, showing the lasting impact. Such information is revealed via our
approach with triad citation networks and septa-segmentation of collaboration
networks.

earlier work may be forgotten for a while or for good, not as
indelible as seemed in data records. We investigate on temporal differentiation and persistence across author collaboration
networks at different epochs.
III. T IME - SHIFTED & CONVOLVED NETWORKS
The conventional static collaboration network is constructed
from the article-author bipartite deprived of temporal activity
information. We introduce instead epoch-centered triad citation networks to enable temporal pattern analysis at mixed
time scales, in adaptation to continuous and new collaboration
activities. We describe our model, its properties, computational
procedure and underlying rationale.
Let 𝑇 be a time window or epoch. Denote by Core the
set of articles published in the period. See the citation matrix
in (a) of Fig. 1. The core articles cite each other in the same
period, represented by the matrix block Core on the diagonal.
This is a closed network. In reality, core articles cite articles in
set Cout (outward links in the same column block), and they
are cited by articles in set Cin (inward links in the same row
block). We term such open network as an epoch-centered triad
network. We take the sub-bipartite with the article vertices
from the triad network on the one side and the involved authors
on the other. See the bipartite in (b) of Fig. 1. We partition

the involved authors into seven cohorts. The septa-partition is
shown in the Venn diagram in (c) of Fig. 1. In particular, the
authors in cohort (4) are active not only during the epoch 𝑇 ,
but also before and after the epoch by one hop in citation. We
refer to this cohort as the persistent cohort.
Often, dynamic network analysis takes one of the extremes
in dealing with time scale [4], [18], [19]. At the one extreme,
one assumes a closed network with fixed boundary and a
dynamics model that describes internal change at microscopic
time scale, subject to initial condition, boundary condition, and
some additional regulation condition. At the other extreme,
a dynamic network is sliced into multiple ones by nonoverlapping time windows at a macroscopic time scale. No
time overlap nor memory/impact among the sliced networks;
no finer temporal resolution to differentiate within each. Each
time-sliced network is then treated as static; subsequent analysis across the networks is subject to the fixed time resolution
by the window size.
We reason differently. Literature graphs are dynamic, but
not on an assumed uniform scale. Collaboration activities
take place at various and mixed time scales, similar to many
social networks, dissimilar to those physical-sensor networks
with built-in clocks or biological networks with intrinsic
circadian rhythms. Our model of epoch-centered triad citation
networks is simple, and innovative in using a data-adaptive
meta resolution (e.g. adapt to each epidemic period) in order
to capture and accommodate the variation in time resolution
or scale. By our schema, the networks are open, not only
time shifted but also permitting temporal convolution and
dilation. The temporal convolution is by one-hop topological
links in citation to precursors and successors. It is time dilated
in citation, not closed to or confined within an imposed
time window. These properties of triad citation networks are
transported at ease to the collaboration networks, each of
which is consequently time-segmented within, at the meta
time scale. Based on the model, we are able to investigate
connection, continuation, differentiation, and deviation across
networks centered at different epochs.
IV. D IFFERENTIATION OF COLLABORATION NETWORKS
The conventional network characterization and correlation
based on degree distribution have limited capacity to reveal
or differentiate temporal and topological relations among
time-segmented collaboration networks, as shown evidently in
Fig. 4. We introduce in this section how we differentiate the
collaboration networks at three granularity levels, and associate them as well, via topological encoding with graphlets.
A. Graphlet spectral descriptors
We review generic graphlets and graphlet dictionaries by
their forms and attributes.
A graphlet is a connected graph with a small vertex set and
a designated node to be incident with. We show in Fig. 2 a
dictionary of 5 (undirected) graphlets, Σ5 = { 𝜎𝑘 }𝑘=0:4 . The
dictionary contains small subgraph patterns: singleton, edge
(𝐾2 ), binary fork (𝐾1,2 ), 2-path (𝑃2 ), and triangle (𝐶3 , 𝐾3 ).

Fig. 6: Graphlet spectrograms of three collaboration networks with respective
labels and time windows as SARS (2002-2004), MERS (2012-2014), and
COVID-19 (2020: Jan.-June). See (1) and the subsequent definition of graphlet
spectrogram. Each column identifies with an author vertex. Row 𝑖 contains
𝜎𝑖 -frequencies across the vertices, 𝑖 = 1 : 4. The frequencies with 𝜎0 are
constantly 1, not shown. The ordering among the (author) vertices is the same
as in the respective adjacency matrices in Fig. 5. The core set (2) is marked
by red boundary lines. A pixel in brighter color indicates a higher frequency
value. Observation: In each of the top two spectrograms, the persistent
cohort (4) has higher concentration of vertices with higher 𝜎2 frequencies
and 𝜎3 frequencies. In fact, vertices with higher 𝜎2 frequencies have higher
centrality positions, see Section V. The persistent cohort (4) is missing in the
spectrogram at the bottom, as the network is in its developing stage.

The designated incidence node is shown with a red square, up
to an isomorphic permutation (shown in red circles). Graphlets
with the same number of nodes form a family with an partial
ordering. For example, 𝜎2 , 𝜎3 and 𝜎4 are a family of trinode graphlets. The partial ordering 𝜎2 , 𝜎3 ≺ 𝜎4 is by the
relationship that 𝜎2 and 𝜎3 are subgraphs of 𝜎4 .
Specific to any undirected graph 𝐺 = (𝑉, 𝐸), we obtain at
every vertex 𝑣 ∈ 𝑉 a graphlet frequency vector of length |Σ|,
the element-𝑘 of which is the number/frequency of 𝜎𝑘 -pattern
induced subgraphs that are incident to 𝑣, 𝑘 = 0, 1, · · · , |Σ|−1.
In other words, we make a transform of graph 𝐺 to a
field of vectors over 𝑉 . The vectors encode, with graphlets
as the coding words/elements, the topological and statistical
information of the graph. The dictionary Σ2 = {𝜎0 , 𝜎1 }
encodes the very basic information. However, it limits network
analysis to the ordinary degree distributions, types, correlations
and models [20], [21]. We use the dictionary Σ5 with much
greater coding capacity, with little cost in computation. The
relationship among the graphlets, computation formulas, and
complexities are detailed in [15].
We describe the graphlet frequencies in a graph 𝐺 = (𝑉, 𝐸)
with the help of a vertex-graphlet incidence structure. Denote
by 𝐵 = (𝑉, Σ; 𝐸𝑣𝜎 ) the bipartite between the graph vertices
and the graphlets, 𝐸𝑣𝜎 ⊂ 𝑉 ×Σ. There is a link (𝑣, 𝜎) between
a vertex 𝑣 ∈ 𝑉 and a graphlet 𝜎 ∈ Σ if 𝑣 is an incident node
on an induced subgraph of 𝜎-pattern. The incident node on a
graphlet is uniquely specified, up to an isomorphic mapping.
For example, graphlet 𝜎4 (clique 𝐾3 or cycle 𝐶3 ) in Fig. 2
is an automorphism. There may be multiple links between
𝑣 and 𝜎𝑘 . We denote them by a single link (𝑣, 𝜎𝑘 ) with a
positive integer weight 𝑑𝑘 (𝑣) for the multiplicity, which is
the frequency with graphlet 𝜎𝑘 . However, the multiplicities

from vertex 𝑣 to multiple graphlets in the same family are not
independently determined. For example, the multiplicities on
links from vertices to 𝜎2 do not include those to sub-graphlets
within 𝜎4 . The weight on (𝑣, 𝜎1 ) is counted independently
as 𝜎1 has no other family member. We describe formally the
transformation of 𝐺 to the frequency vector field over 𝑉 , with
𝐾 = |Σ| − 1,
f (𝑣) = f (𝑢|𝐺) = [𝑑0 (𝑣), 𝑑1 (𝑣), · · · , 𝑑𝐾 (𝑣)]T ,

𝑣 ∈ 𝑉. (1)

For any 𝑘, 0 ≤ 𝑘 < 𝐾, 𝑑𝑘 (𝑣) is the frequency of pattern𝜎𝑘 subgraphs incident at 𝑣. In particular, 𝑑0 (𝑣) = 1, 𝑑1 (𝑣)
is the degree of 𝑣 on graph 𝐺. The descriptor f (𝑣) encodes
the topological structure of the neighborhood of vertex 𝑣, with
the graphlets as the coding words/elements. We use the longhand notation for node-wise descriptor f (𝑣|𝐺) when necessary.
We present graphlet spectrograms of three epoch-associated
collaboration networks, labeled respectively as SARS, MERS
and COVID-19 in Fig. 6. The descriptors are color-coded and
placed in columns, with nodes in the same ordering as in
Fig. 5. The graphlet dependencies, fast and exact transform
formulas and complexity analysis are detailed in [22]. In
implementation, we use GraphBLAS [23] to exploit sparse
patterns and Cilk [24] for multi-threaded programming.
B. Discrepancy measures
Let 𝐺𝑥 = (𝑉𝑥 , 𝐸𝑥 ) and 𝐺𝑦 = (𝑉𝑦 , 𝐸𝑦 ) be two collaboration
networks. By the septa-partition (c) of Fig. 1, the (author) vertices on each collaboration network is partitioned into 7 nonoverlapping cohort clusters. Denote by 𝒳 = {𝑋𝑖 , 𝑖 = 1 : 7}
the septa-partition of 𝑉𝑥 ; by 𝒴 = {𝑌𝑗 , 𝑗 = 1 : 7}, of 𝑉𝑦 .
Denote by 𝐺𝑧 their intersection, i.e., 𝐺𝑧 = 𝐺𝑥 ∩ 𝐺𝑦 = (𝑉𝑥 ∩
𝑉𝑦 , 𝐸𝑥 ∩ 𝐸𝑦 ). The graph intersection is the largest subgraph
shared by 𝐺𝑥 and 𝐺𝑦 . The symmetric difference between the
graph vertex sets is 𝑉𝑥 Δ𝑉𝑦 = (𝑉𝑥 − 𝑉𝑦 ) ∪ (𝑉𝑦 − 𝑉𝑥 ) =
(𝑉𝑥 −𝑉𝑧 )∪(𝑉𝑦 −𝑉𝑧 ). If 𝑉𝑥 Δ𝑉𝑦 ̸= ∅, there are authors active in
one network, inactive in the other. Yet otherwise, i.e., 𝑉𝑥 = 𝑉𝑦 ,
the two networks 𝐺𝑥 and 𝐺𝑦 may still differ in topological
connections, rendering non-empty symmetric difference between the edge sets, 𝐸𝑥 Δ𝐸𝑦 = (𝐸𝑥 − 𝐸𝑧 ) ∪ (𝐸𝑦 − 𝐸𝑧 ).
However, the size of the symmetric difference between the
edge sets lacks the capacity to characterize and differentiate
the changes in collaboration patterns.
We measure the discrepancy (discordance), or agreement
(concordance), in topological structures between 𝐺𝑥 and 𝐺𝑦 ,
using the graphlet spectral descriptors. We measure the discrepancy at three granularity levels. Define the relative differ-

TABLE 3: Agreement scores by 1 − 𝜂, at the cohort level, between MERS as the comparison target and the other networks as the references, along with
aggregation weights (in red) of (3). In the left table, 𝒳 = {𝑋𝑖 }𝑖=1:7 is the septa-cohort-partition for the target MERS, the scores are 1−𝜂(𝑋𝑖 , 𝐺𝑧 ), where
𝐺𝑧 changes across the columns associated respectively with the reference networks. In the right table, 𝒴 is the septa-cohort-partition of each target network,
the scores (in black) are 1−𝜂(𝑌𝑗 , 𝐺𝑧 ). The weights (in red) are based on the cohort sizes in Table 4. The last rows in both tables are the components of (4).
The sums give entries of Table 2, which summarizes all such comparisons at cohort level. Key observation. The cohorts of MERS mostly remain in network
Ebola (by the left table), and are more influential to the developing network COVID-19 (by the right table).

septa-partition of (c) in Fig. 1. They are used in the weighting scheme for
topological discrepancy aggregation of (3) and Tables 2 and 3. The size of the
largest connected component is in the last row. Observation. The total number
of authors with each of the networks increases steadily with the forward shift
in the epochs. We expect a burst with COVID-19 as the network already has
a massive size while in its early developing stage (and therefore the absence
of cohorts (3)-(6)).

where ./ denotes the Hadamard division, i.e., element-wise
division. Let 𝐺′ be a graph. If 𝑣 ∈
/ 𝑉 (𝐺′ ), we set f (𝑣|𝐺′ ) = 0.
We measure the relative difference in topological connectivity
at each vertex 𝑣 between 𝐺𝑥 and 𝐺𝑧 ,

𝜂(𝑣, 𝑉𝑥 , 𝐺𝑧 ) = ⃒ rdiff f (𝑣|𝐺𝑥 ), f (𝑣|𝐺𝑧 ) ⃒𝑝 , 𝑣 ∈ 𝑉𝑥 , (2)
where |a|𝑝 is the order-𝑝 Hölder mean of vector a with its
elements in absolute values. The weights are predetermined
on the graphlets in the dictionary; equal weights are used
for empirical study later. Strictly speaking, the difference
f (𝑣|𝐺𝑥 ) − f (𝑣|𝐺𝑧 ) characterizes the change in the topological neighborhoods of vertex 𝑣 in graph 𝐺𝑥 and graph 𝐺𝑧 .
The first element, associated with the singleton graphlet 𝜎0 ,
accumulates to the difference in the vertex set between 𝑉𝑥 and
𝑉𝑧 . The second element reflects the difference in the ordinary
degree at every vertex. When graphlet 𝜎𝑘 , 𝑘 > 0, is absent in
both vertex neighborhoods, element-𝑘 in the relative difference
is zero. We aggregate the local changes to the vertex subsets
by the septa-partition and then to the entire vertex set of 𝐺𝑥 ,

The weights in (3a) are equal. The weights in (3b) increase
monotonically with |𝑋𝑖 |/|𝑉𝑥 | and sum to 1.
Similarly, we define 𝜂(𝑣, 𝑉𝑦 , 𝐺𝑧 ), 𝜂(𝑌𝑗 , 𝐺𝑧 ), 1 ≤ 𝑗 ≤ 7,
and 𝜂(𝒴, 𝐺𝑧 ). We note the inequalities at many vertices,

logarithmic scatter plots, among the author vertices in the persistent cohort
(4), one for each of the 6 collaboration networks, except that Cin is empty in
network COVID-19. See Table 4 for their respective sizes. The points in red
are common to all 6 persistent cohorts across the networks, they distinguish
and highlight 103 researchers who are continuously active and influential in
virus research through two decades or longer. Among them are S. J. M. Peiris
(at the top in darker red) and A. S. Fauci (in bright green). Observation. First,
the dynamic persistence information lost in a static collaboration network and
analysis is uncovered by our novel analysis method. Secondly, we note in
particular the phenomenon, common to all 6 networks, that the authors in red
tend to have relatively higher 𝜎2 -frequencies than the others in gray in the
same local range of 𝜎4 -frequencies. See further elaboration in Section V.

𝜂(𝑣, 𝑉𝑥 , 𝐺𝑧 ) ̸= 𝜂(𝑣, 𝑉𝑦 , 𝐺𝑧 ), unless the change in topology
between 𝐺𝑥 and 𝐺𝑦 is small. The aggregation weights are
symmetrical between 𝒳 and 𝒴 in the sense that {𝑤𝑖𝑥 } are the
same as {𝑤𝑖𝑦 } when |𝑋𝑖 | = |𝑌𝑖 |, 1 ≤ 𝑖 ≤ 7. Together, we have
a symmetric scalar measure of the topological discrepancy
between 𝐺𝑥 and 𝐺𝑦 ,
𝜂(𝐺𝑥 , 𝐺𝑦 ) = 𝜂(𝒳 , 𝐺𝑧 )/2 + 𝜂(𝒴, 𝐺𝑧 )/2.

The discrepancy value 𝜂(𝐺𝑥 , 𝐺𝑦 ) is zero if and only if 𝐺𝑥 =
𝐺𝑦 . It is positive and bounded by 1 otherwise.
V. F INDINGS FROM UNCOVERED TEMPORAL PATTERNS
We provide in 8 figures and 4 tables the basic information
and empirically analytic data about 6 epoch-centered collaboration networks, all drawn from the live literature graph
LG-covid19-HOTP. The figures and tables are chosen to
clarify the information and packed to fit within the text space
limit. In each figure/table caption we detail the data description
and brief certain observation(s). Below we elaborate on a few
noteworthy phenomena and valuable findings.

author rank by degree ( 1)

Fig. 8: Topological betweenness among multiple collaboration clusters captured and encoded by 𝜎2 -frequencies, which are shown in blue points placed
by the rank-size distribution of degrees (𝜎1 ) in red. See Section V about the
betweenness of 𝜎2 , the bi-folk graphlet (𝐾1,2 ). The plot for each of the 6
epoch-centered collaboration networks is of log-log scales. Key observation.
(i) Author nodes with the same degree of 𝜎1 (in 𝑦 coordinate) differ greatly
in 𝜎2 -frequencies by over an order of magnitude. An author with higher 𝜎2 frequency makes more connections among different author (triangle) clusters
on different articles. (ii) Nodes with higher 𝜎2 -frequencies include the hubnodes (with top degrees) but also significantly outnumber in accumulated
𝜎2 -frequencies those of the hub-nodes by orders of magnitude. They are
responsible for the grass-root connectivity of a network. (iii) The difference
between 𝜎2 and 𝜎1 is incidentally magnified by the artifact of 𝜎2 gaps/voids,
the most noticeable one is around location 100 of degree (𝜎1 ). Some articles
of scientific experiments have many contributing authors, above a threshold
typically set by data record registration. In particular, the threshold is 100
by Scopus. The retained co-authors have at least degree 100 each, many of
them may not be co-authors of other articles in the LG database and thus the
𝜎2 gap at 100. The co-authors rounded off have their 𝜎2 counts reduced.

We start with the pairwise comparisons in Table 2 among the
networks at the coarsest granularity. To see the comparisons of
one network with the others in the upper or lower triangular,
follow the row and column by the same label (such as MERS)
and take the turn at the diagonal. The intersection set sizes
are consistently increasing with time forward. However, the
agreement profiles are not necessarily monotonically related.
Specifically, among the first five, the agreement scores of

SARS (or Avian flu) with the rest decrease with time distance;
of MERS, peaked with Ebola, and vice versa; of Swine flu,
peaked with MERS. The developing network labeled COVID19 is more influenced by more recent networks.
The next comparisons are at the cohort level. We see a few
phenomena in Table 3. The size of cohort (3) is larger with
network more distant from the present, although the network
author size |𝑉 | is not monotonically increasing. This correlates
reasonably with the reverse trend in cohort (1). Together they
indicate the lasting and expanding impact of the earlier work
by collective selection and memory of the research community.
We highlight our discovery and understanding of the topological betweenness encoded by 𝜎2 , the bi-fork graphlet, which
contributes what lacks with 𝜎1 (degree) and 𝜎4 (triangle). In
Fig. 6 we point out a remarkable connection at the persistent cohort (4) between temporal segmentation and spectral
differentiation. In Fig. 7 we detail the connection with the
scatter plot of 𝜎2 -frequencies against 𝜎4 -frequencies over the
persistent cohort. The triangle is a celebrated motif for the
cluster coefficients, a centrality measure. In fact, the modest
bi-fork plays the critical role of connecting those triangle
clusters. An author has a triangle connection with every other
two co-authors. All authors of the same article gain the same
amount of triangle count and degree count as well. In contrast,
an author is at the root of a bi-fork only if the author has
more than one articles with different sets of authors. That
is, a bi-fork vertex connects two triangle clusters. The 𝜎2
uniquely encodes such betweenness. Furthermore, we take the
intersection of all persistent cohorts over time, and find 103
authors. Among them are Malik Peiris, the first person to
isolate the SARS virus, and Anthony S. Fauci, well known
for his research on HIV and other infectious diseases. These
authors have continued presence and influence in two decades
or longer. They typically have higher 𝜎2 frequencies than those
at the same 𝜎4 frequencies. One may use a similar approach
to measuring temporal-topological betweenness.
We provide in Fig. 8 solid evidence of 𝜎2 playing another
important role in quantifying the grassroots as the backbone
of network connectivity. The data points in all 6 plots show
unambiguously that while the elite club of hub nodes (with
top degrees) is credited for the small-world phenomenon, the
collaboration network rests largely on the 𝜎2 bridge builders.
This finding implies that a conclusion drawn solely from
the 𝜎1 degree information could be much biased to the hub
nodes and prone to changes at the hubs. Our analysis suggests
that a network containing larger mass of nodes with high 𝜎2
frequencies is likely more robust to adversarial changes. We
add that, in its unique roles, the bi-fork graphlet must co-exist
with the triangle graphlet, the count of bi-forks at each vertex
excludes those in any triangle, see Section IV-A.
Our analysis results are readily interpretable. The remarkable findings reported above are beyond the reach of conventional approaches. Our method suggests new ways to
investigate the dynamics of author collaboration.
