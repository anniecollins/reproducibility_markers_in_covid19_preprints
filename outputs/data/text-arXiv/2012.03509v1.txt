ABSTRACT
With the outbreak of COVID-19, how to mitigate and suppress
its spread is a big issue to the government. Department of public
health need powerful models to model and predict the trend and
scale of such pandemic. And models that could evaluate the eﬀect
of the public policy are also essential to the ﬁght with the COVID19.
A main limitation of existing models is that they can only evaluate the policy by calculating 𝑅0 after infection happens instead
of giving observable index. To tackle this, based on the transmission character of the COVID-19, we preposed a novel framework
Spatial-Temporal-Susceptible-Infected-Removed (STSIR) model. In
particular, we merged both intra-city and inter-city mobility index
with the traditional SIR dynamics and make it a dynamic system.
And we proved that the STSIR system is a closed system which
makes the system self-consistent. And ﬁnally we proposed a MultiStage Simulated Annealing (MSSA) algorithm to ﬁnd optimal parameter of the system. In our experiments, based on Baidu Mobility
dataset [1], and China pandemic dataset provided by Dingxiangyuan[2],
our model can eﬀectively predict the total scale of the pandemic
and also gives clear policy analysis with observable index.

1 INTRODUCTION
Building accurate models to predict and quantify the eﬀect of infectious diseases is very important to today’s public health. The
classic SI, SIR and SEIR models [3] have been proposed and used
for a long time. However, with the development of modern transportation, the range and the eﬀect of infectious disease are widely
ampliﬁed, which traditional SI, SIR and SEIR models become insuﬃcient to describe the transmission characteristics of new infectious diseases accurately. For example, the outbreak of the new
COVID-19 pandemic has caused nearly 20 million infections and
hundreds of thousands of deaths nowadays. We have not expected
so much loss that such disease can cause, which urge us to build
better infectious disease models to analyze and monitor the pandemic’s development. And we can expect to rely on such tools to
help us understand the epidemic transmission characters and make
correct and reasonable epidemic prevention policies to save lives.
In order to better ﬁt and analyze the spread of such infectious diseases, various scholars have conducted diﬀerent new methods. On
one hand, several scholars add new transiting phases (eg. Asymptomatic, Hospitalized, etc.) in infectious models[4–7]. However, the
method of simply adding phases has several shortcomings. Firstly,
the abundant parameters make parameter calculation very laborious. Secondly, after adding multiple phases, the model focus on
only simulates a single city or region, and cannot model the ﬂow
of people between multiple regions. The transmission characters
between regions have been ignored. Thirdly, with the diﬀerent definition of diﬀerent phases, properly categorizing patients to those
phases is diﬃcult.
To make the model be able to model multiple regions, other scholars have added transportation statistics such as civil aviation and
railways data to model pandemic evolution[5, 8–11]. Nevertheless,
the information granularity of civil aviation and railway statistics
are too coarse to give the intercity information accurately, such

Conference’17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA

modeling can only give a rough pandemic trend, with low predicting accuracy. Such models considered the inter-region transmission from the origin of the pandemic outbreak to other major
cities. But with the development of modern transportation. New
situations such that infected people may travel not only from the
outbreak city to the ﬁrst destination but also from the ﬁrst destination to the second one are also crucial for the trend analysis, which
has not been considered by the current models. Furthermore, the
basic reproduction number 𝑅0 is essential in modeling. However,
such a parameter can only be calculated based on infected numbers after infection happens. The model can only analyze the effect of our quarantine or intervention policy by heuristically imagining how low the policy can suppress the 𝑅0 to without giving
any quantiﬁable index that we can monitoring[7, 10]. A systematic ﬁne-grained spatial-temporal model that can better describe
the trend of the pandemic and give quantiﬁable indexes to make
policies aim to mitigate pandemic spread is desperately needed.
To achieve this target, combining mobility data with classical
infectious models is an insightful idea. With the prevalence of mobile phones and mobile apps, mobility data provided by large companies gives an accurate and timely overview of the migration of
people[12]. The near real-time and ﬁne-grained data are undoubtedly helpful in building new pandemic modeling frameworks[13,
14]. Multiple researches have shown that non-pharmaceutical interventions have obvious eﬀects to mobility activities[15, 16]. For
example, Baidu and Tencent provide an apparent migration curve
of people between regions[1], through the data collected from various apps (Figure2). Moreover, due to the accuracy of positioning
and ITS development, the trajectory information generated by people when they travel within the city also allows us to obtain a
description of the degree of intra-city activities.(Figure 3) During
the pandemic, compared with the ﬁxed and extensive civil aviation railway statistics, mobility data gave a more ﬁne-grained
transportation overview from inter-region and intra-region perspectives.
With the considerations list above, we proposed the STSIR framework. A succinct, accurate, quantiﬁable framework that gives pandemic trend prediction and quantiﬁable indexes could help mitigate the pandemic spread. Generally, the STSIR model contains a
system of diﬀerential equations in which we have designed two
novel parts to model the spread of infectious diseases intra-regionally
and inter-regionally. We set one day as a time segment. We only
need the initial information when the outbreak started to give a
pandemic evolving curve by fusing the intra-city activity index and
the inter-city activity index.

RELATED WORKS

With the outbreak of the COVID-19, numerous studies related to
such infectious disease are emerged. New models adopted new
transmission character of the COVID-19 in order to get better model
performance
Initially, Wu et al.[10] integrated inter-regional traﬃc originated
from Wuhan with SEIR model to catch the pandemic’s transmission character. However, inter-regional transmission between other

Wang Pan, Qipu Deng, Jiadong Li, Zhi Wang, and Wenwu Zhu

big cities has been ignored. Such a model has not considered latent infection transmission between big cities except the initial outbreak point. Followed by this research, Wang et al. [7] tried to give
an analysis of the pandemic by intuitively adjusting the 𝑅0 . Such
a method gives an overview of the pandemic with diﬀerent 𝑅0 s.
However, no observable indexes related to 𝑅0 are mentioned in
such a model, which gives diﬃculties in evaluating our policy’s effect. Furthermore, Gatto et al. [4] and Zhou [5] added a new asymptomatic phase into the pandemic evolving procedure. Gatto et al.
[4] also added pre-symptomatic and hospitalized phases to give a
more accurate dynamic of COVID-19. Nevertheless, with the diﬀerent deﬁnitions of the diﬀerent phases, accurately categorizing patients into phases is quite diﬃcult. Lau et al.’s work[9] tried to use
air traﬃc statistics to model transmission traits. However, the granularity of the statistic data limits the model performance. Ting et
al. [12], Ienca et al.[14] and Buckee et al.[13] pointed out the importance of the mobility data in ﬁghting COVID-19. With such insight,
combined with mobility data, Jia et al. [17] gave out a model that
could help analyze the risk distribution of the pandemics. Gatto
et al. [4] and Wu et al. [10] also enhance their works with interregional mobility data. Nevertheless, the mobility activities within
each region are not considered thoroughly.

3 PROPOSED MODEL
3.1 Preliminaries
In this subsection, we present the fundamental concepts about basic epidemiology models. We start with pure SI and SIR models.
Moreover, we analyzed its usefulness in today’s COVID-19 cases.
As the analysis goes on, we derive our new STSIR framework from
the basic models.
Susceptible-Infected (SI) model. The most basic epidemiology
model is Susceptible-Infected(SI) model. As shown in ﬁgure 4, there
are two transiting phases in the dynamic model.
And the whole dynamics will be running based on the following
equations:

Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model. A transformation of the SI model is Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model.
As shown in the ﬁgure 5 there are three transiting phases in the
dynamic model. A new Removed phase is included to describe
the people who are recovered, dead, or quarantined, which do not
aﬀect the infecting procedure.

Other model with new phases During this COVID-19 pandemic,
clinical reports [18] have shown that people may show no symptoms or just mild symptoms after they get infected. However, such
people also get the ability to infect others. This kind of character makes this virus can be easily spread widely. As shown in ﬁgure 6, numerous scholars added new phases to enrich the dynamic
model.

clearly categorized patients to the model phases are tricky. To get
a clear deﬁnition of each phase and a succinct model, we choose to
adopt the SIR model as our primary model and focus more on the
pandemic’s transmission character.

Figure 7: Whole framework of the STSIR system
STSIR Framework As shown in ﬁgure 7, the whole framework is consist of several STSIR Layers. Each layer models the
daily infection and transmission procedure of the pandemic. With
an input of the initial infection and necessary information, the
framework can give out the simulated infection numbers based on
the corresponding mobility index.

Mobility Index To better describe the pandemic’s transmission
character, We adopt two kinds of mobility index in the model. Intracity index and Inter-city index. The intra-city index describes the
activity density within the city. The inter-city index describes the
movement between regions. As shown in ﬁgure 2, since the government shut down Wuhan, the origin of the outbreak, the intercity mobility originated from Wuhan to other big cities in China
dropped from a high value to near 0. However, there is still transmission between other big cities, as we can see from ﬁgure 1, which
means that there are possibilities that those who get infected can
move to multiple big cities and seed the transmission of the pandemic there.
Furthermore, as we can see from ﬁgure 3, the intra-city index has
dropped dramatically when quarantine and stay-home policy begins. However, there are still low-level activities within the city,
which give chances of the infection. So both inter-city and intracity index should be included in our model.
STSIR Layer After considering the problems list above we propose the STSIR Layer which contains a dynamic model shown in
follow equations:

(16)

Given 𝑘 cities in the system, here 𝑺 (𝒕), 𝑰 (𝒕), 𝑹 (𝒕) are the system
susceptible, infectious and recovered vectors with the shape of [𝑘, 1]
at time 𝑡 respectively. 𝑵 denotes the population vector of each city
with the shape of [𝑘, 1]. 𝛿 1 represents the city-wise multiplier for
the contribution of intra-city activity to the pandemic transmission. 𝛿 2 is a uniﬁed multiplier to denote the transmission between
multiple cities. 𝛾 1 denotes the removing coeﬃcient, which shows
the removing rate of the infectious people. T𝐼 (𝑡) and T𝑂 (𝑡) are
Intra-city mobility index with shape the of [𝑘, 1] at time 𝑡 and Intercity mobility index with the shape of [𝑘, 𝑘] at time 𝑡 respectively.
Detailed meanings can be checked from table 1.
Now we show the derivation of such system models. For each
city 𝑖, we consider the transition procedure for each phase, respectively. For the susceptible phase, the change of the number can be
consist of three parts:
• The people who were susceptible get infected within the
city
• The people who are susceptible coming from other cities
• The people who are susceptible moving to other cities

• The people who are infectious going to other cities
• The people who are quarantined, dead, or recovered thus

Based on equation (24), the inter-city transmission mechanism implement no change of the total population.

Parameter Learning There are several parameters in the STSIR
model 𝜃 = {𝛿 1, 𝛿 2, 𝛾 1 }. Because of the asymptomatic state of the
COVID-19 and the complexity of the case test, we consider the
oﬃcial announced cases is a delayed expression of the genuine
situation. Instead of ﬁtting the oﬃcially conﬁrmed curve, we aim
to train the model to be able to give a trend of the pandemic by
simulating. Given two time sequences, 𝐼𝑠 (𝑡) and 𝐼𝑡 (𝑡), which denote simulated numbers of daily infections and oﬃcially conﬁrmed
numbers of daily infections respectively, we want to minimize the
gap between total number of cases by simulation and the real conﬁrmed numbers after the test delay, which can be deﬁned as following optimization problem:
∫ 𝑡−𝑑𝑒𝑙𝑎𝑦
∫ 𝑡
𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑚𝑖𝑧𝑒 𝐿𝑜𝑠𝑠 (
𝐼𝑠 (𝜃, 𝑡)𝑑𝑡 −

To get the parameters of such a multi-system model, we developed
a Multi-Stage Simulated Annealing algorithm. Simulated Annealing [19] algorithm has been used for multiple optimization
tasks[20], including both single objective and multiple objective
optimization problems. It has shown its eﬀectiveness in optimizing parameters. However, traditional simulated annealing is not
suitable to optimize a dynamic model with multiple inter-reacting
systems. So based on our problem, we use Multi-Stage Simulated

Annealing algorithm to ﬁnd our optimal parameters for the model.

EXPERIMENTS

To evaluate the eﬀectiveness of STSIR model, we conduct experiments on with Baidu Mobility dataset [1] and China pandemic
dataset provided by Dingxiangyuan [2]. We will then provide a
brief data description in Section 4.1. In Section 4.2, we will analyze
the data we have, and illustrate our experiment settings. In Section
4.3, we demonstrate the strong predicting power of our model. In
section 4.4, we analyze how great the model can help us analyze
the eﬀect of diﬀerent policies in pandemic transmission.

Data Description

Baidu Mobility Dataset Baidu Mobility dataset [1] is provided
by the Baidu company. Baidu search engine, as well as its various
applications, owns over 1 billion users in China. Every time an

application is launched, Baidu collects the IP address of the end
device. Thus, Baidu could know how the crowd moves from one
place to another based on the changes of the IP address. The information is represented as a mobility index, of which a higher
number means a more frequent movement of the crowd. The data
is fully anonymized and collected according to the terms and conditions of Baidu for privacy concerns.
The dataset contains two kinds of mobility data of 388 administrative areas. The administrative areas are four municipalities, 343
prefecture-level cities, and 41 province directly governed counties
(including Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan). The two kinds of mobility data, intra-city index and inter-city index, are two ﬂoat numbers representing the activity strength within the city and between
cities per day, respectively. The record ranges from 2020-01-01 to
2020-03-15. Since the range covers the Chinese New Year, the dataset
also provides a historical intra-city index of the same period based
on Lunar Calendar for reference. Table 1 summarizes the statistics
of the dataset.
DingXiangYuan COVID-19 Dataset Dingxiangyuan[2] COVID19 dataset contains COVID-19/2019-nCov time series infection data
in China. The data source is Ding Xiang Yuan. Ding Xiang Yuan is
a professional medical website in China, and its data is authorized
and used by mainstream media in China, such as CCTV and China
Daily. The dataset contains the overall infected number in 388 administrative areas, including four municipalities, 343 prefecturelevel cities, and 42 province directly governed counties. The time
ranges from 2020-01-01 to 2020-05-19. The data, which is an integer

4.2

Experiments settings

As China has conducted a strict policy of distancing and quarantine, the whole pandemic in China become relatively stable (Figure
8) during late February, which enables us to test our model by training our model at an early stage, and then feed it with the mobility
index to give the simulated ﬁnal scale of the pandemic. We will
calculate the MAE (Mean Absolute Error) with the genuine ﬁnal
scale of the pandemic by:
𝑘

1 Õ
|𝑦𝑖 − 𝑥𝑖 |
𝑀𝐴𝐸 = ( )
𝑛 𝑖=1

(26)

In this section, we demonstrate how well our model gives the ﬁnal predictions of the real data. Moreover, the experiments show
the model performs well in giving predictions of the total conﬁrmed cases. As shown in the optimization problem (25), we want
the model can give the current transmission situation based on
the concurrent conﬁrmed cases are given. Because of the asymptomatic character of the COVID-19, there always a delay between
the tested conﬁrmed cases and the real infected cases. During the
experiment, we set the outbreak that has been passed for 50 days,
and the delay between the test and real infection is 20 days. We
then train the model at this stage and try to give the total conﬁrmed
case at the 70 days, based on real intra-city activity and inter-city
activity. As shown in 4, the STSIR model achieves an overall MAE
of 7.76 in predicting the ﬁnal scale of the pandemic, which denotes
its prediction power. As shown in 9, we can see the gap between
the real conﬁrmed cases and the simulated curve. It shows the delay eﬀect of the case test. When quarantine and distancing policy

is conducted, the transmission tends to be stopped, and the model
can predict the ﬁnal scale of the pandemic well.

4.4

Policy Analysis

In this section, we conduct experiments on what if there is no
"quarantine" and "shut down" policies are made how severe the
pandemic will go in China. Since the transportation system will be
really activated during the Chinese New Year, the pandemic will
go really mad if no such policies are made. We insert the mobility index last year in the model to see what will happen in Huber
Province. As shown in Figure 10, if we do not shut down Wuhan,
there will be massive infected populations moving to cities near
Wuhan and causing massive infections.

5

CONCLUSION

To tackle the spread of COVID-19, we introduce the STSIR model
to quantify the scale of the pandemic and help to analyze the eﬀect
of the policies by introducing diﬀerent mobility indexes. The system is designed to be self-consistent, and a new MSSA algorithm
is introduced to learn the model parameters. Experimental results
verify the eﬀectiveness of our study. It shows outstanding predicting power and excellent analysis capability.
