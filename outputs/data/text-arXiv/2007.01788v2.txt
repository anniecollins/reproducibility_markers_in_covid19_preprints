Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic is the worst pandemic to strike the world in over a century.
Crucial to stemming the tide of the SARSCoV-2 virus is communicating to vulnerable
populations the means by which they can protect themselves. To this end, the collaborators
forming the Translation Initiative for COvid19 (TICO-19)1 have made test and development data available to AI and MT researchers
in 35 different languages in order to foster
the development of tools and resources for improving access to information about COVID19 in these languages. In addition to 9 highresourced, “pivot” languages, the team is targeting 26 lesser resourced languages, in particular languages of Africa, South Asia and
South-East Asia, whose populations may be
the most vulnerable to the spread of the virus.
The same data is translated into all of the languages represented, meaning that testing or development can be done for any pairing of languages in the set. Further, the team is converting the test and development data into translation memories (TMXs) that can be used by
localizers from and to any of the languages.2

1 Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic marks the worst pandemic to strike the world since 1918. At the time
of this writing,3 the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus responsible for COVID-19 has infected over ten million people worldwide, with over a half a million

deaths. While these numbers are likely underreported, they are growing at an alarming rate, and
many millions of people could become infected or
perish without proper prevention measures.
Effective communication from health authorities is essential to protect at-risk populations, slow
down the spread of the disease, and decrease its
morbidity and mortality (UNOCHA, 2020). Yet,
preventive measures such as stay-at-home orders,
social distancing, and requirements to wear personal protective equipment (e.g. masks, gloves,
etc.) have proven difficult to relay. That’s not accounting for the difficulty to disseminate correct
technical information about the disease, such as
symptoms (e.g., fever, chills, etc.), specifics about
testing (e.g., viral vs. antibody testing), and treatments (e.g., intubation, plasma transfusion).
While official communications from the
World’s Health Organization (WHO) are constantly published and revised, they are mostly
limited to major languages. This has resulted in
a vacuum in many languages that has been filled
by an infodemic of misinformation, as described
by the WHO. Non-governmental organizations
(NGOs) such as Translators without Borders
(TWB) play an important role in delivering
multilingual communication in emergencies, such
as the COVID-19 pandemic, but their reach and
capacity has been outsized by the needs presented
by the pandemic. To date, TWB has translated
over 3.5 million words with over 80 non-profit
organizations for more than 100 language pairs as
part of their COVID-19 response.
Translation technologies such as automatic Machine Translation (MT) and Computer Assisted
Translation (CAT) present unique opportunities to
scale the throughput of human translators. However, given the sensitivity of the content, it is critical that the translations produced automatically
are of the highest possible quality.

The Translation Initiative for COvid-19 (TICO19) effort marks a unique collaboration between
public and private entities that came together
shortly after the beginning of the pandemic.4 The
focus of TICO-19 is to enable the translation of
content related to COVID-19 into a wide range of
languages. First, we make available a collection of
translation memories and technical glossaries so
that language service providers (LSPs), translators
and volunteers can make use of them to expedite
their work and ensure consistency and accuracy.
Second, we provide an open-source, multi-lingual
benchmark set (which includes data for very-lowresource languages) specialized in the medical domain, which is intended to track the quality of current machine translation systems, thus enabling future research in the area. Lastly, we provide monolingual and bi-lingual resources for MT practitioners to use in order to advance the state-of-the-art
in medical and humanitarian Machine Translation,
as well as other natural language processing (NLP)
applications.
Our hope is that our work will in the shortterm enable the translation of important communications into multiple languages, and that in the
long-term, it will serve to foster the research on
MT for specialized content into low-resource languages. Through these resources we hope that our
society is better prepared to quickly respond to the
needs of translation in the midst of crises (e.g., for
future crises, a la Lewis et al. (2011)).

2 The Value of Translation Technologies
in Crisis Scenarios
During a crisis, whether it is local to one region
or is a worldwide pandemic, communicating effectively in the languages and formats people understand is central to effective programs on the
ground. For example, as part of the effort to
control the spread of COVID-19, the Global Humanitarian Response Plan recognizes community
engagement in relevant languages as a key strat4
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared
COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11th, 2020. The TICO-19
collaborators came together in the days following and first
met as a group (over Zoom) on March 20th. It cannot be
understated the rapidity with which this collaboration came
together and how seamlessly the participants, many erstwhile
competitors, have worked in harmony and without animosity.
It is truly a testament to the needs of the greater good outweighing personal differences or potentially conflicting objectives.

egy (UNOCHA, 2020).5 In some countries, this
will be all the more vital because information will
be the main defense against the disease, and particular effort will be needed to make it accessible
and grounded in local culture and context. Among
these are countries where large sections of the population do not speak the dominant language.
Historically, MT, NLP and translation technologies have played a crucial role in crisis scenarios.
The response to the Haitian earthquake in 2010
was notable for the broad use of technology in
the humanitarian response, relying more on crowdsourced translations and geolocation, but notably,
translation technology was also used. In the days
following the earthquake, Haitian citizens were encouraged to text messages requesting assistance
to “4636”, and as many as 5,000 messages were
texted to this number per hour. Unfortunately for
the aid agencies, whose dominant languages were
English and French (aid agencies included the US
Navy, the Red Cross, and Doctors without Borders), most of the SMS messages were in Haitian
Kreyòl. Quickly, the Haitian Kreyòl speaking diaspora around the world were activated by the Mission 4636 consortium to translate the SMS messages and geolocate (Munro, 2010), and the translated messages were handed off to aid agencies for
triage and action. The Mission 4636 infrastructure
included a high-precision rule-based MT (Lewis
et al., 2011), and within days to weeks after the
earthquake, statistical MT engines were brought
online by Microsoft (Lewis, 2010) and Google.6
Translation technology continues to be used
in a variety of crisis and relief scenarios. Notable among these is Translators without Borders
(TWB) use of translation memories for translating
to a number of under-resourced languages in relief
settings. Likewise, the Standby Task Force,7 who
are activated in a variety of relief settings, note
the use of MT in various deployments around the
world, e.g., for Urdu in the Pakistan earthquake of
5
The plan does not call out Machine Translation per se,
but does call out the need for content to be produced and disseminated in “accessible languages”, and the need for communication in “local languages”.
6
Although these engines were not integrated into the
relief pipeline developed by Munro and colleagues, Lewis
et al. (2011) document how MT could be integrated into a
crowd-centric relief pipeline like that used by Mission 4636,
whereby MT, even if low-precision or noisy, could provide
first-pass translations which could then be triaged before being handed off to translators for more accurate translations
and geolocation.

2011 and for Spanish in the Ecuador earthquake in
2016. The EU funded INTERnAtional network on
Crisis Translation (INTERACT)8 project, started
a couple of years before the COVID-19 pandemic,
focused on crisis translation, specifically in health
crises such as pandemics, with a focus on improving resilience in times of crises through communication, ultimately with the goal of reducing loss
of life.9 Likewise, during the current pandemic,
several community-driven efforts have sprung up
to fulfil the need for information communication.
The Endangered Languages Project10 , for example, has collected community-produced translations of public health information in hundreds of
languages in various formats.
What is not tracked is the degree to which publicly available MT tools and resources are used
in crisis and relief settings, e.g., translation apps
and tools from Amazon, Google and Microsoft,
or the translation feature built into Facebook (e.g.,
automatically translating posts). The authors suspect use may be broad, but there are no published
accounts documenting just how broadly and how
much these tools are used in crises. Tantalizing evidence of the use of publicly available tools was
noted by Lewis et al. (2011) who documented traffic in the Microsoft Translator apps in the weeks
following the Haitian earthquake: they noted that
at least 5 percent of the Haitian Kreyòl traffic was
relief-related. It is likely that Google’s and Microsoft’s apps are used even when cell phone infrastructure is unavailable or destroyed, since the
tools permit users to download models to their devices so they can perform offline translations.11
In crises, it is clear that organizations need
the capacity to communicate critical information
and key messages into the languages people understand, at speed and at scale. Crisis affected
communities could access content in local languages through various channels such as SMS, online chatbots, or more traditional printed materials.
Their questions and feedback can be used to refine
content to better meet their needs. Likewise, relief
agencies need access to SMS and other communiques in local languages in order to more effec8

Crucially, it should be noted that these apps and tools
are available for no more than 110 languages, leaving most
of the world’s languages in the dark.

tively and equitably distribute aid.
MT can help the various actors to translate and
disseminate essential communications in a timely
manner without the need to wait on human translators. This is particularly important in low resourced languages where professional translators
are not readily available. Domain-specific MT can
also assist translators with the right terminology to
convey the correct response and standardize concepts. Furthermore, people who are unable to understand major languages could get access to vital
information (such as news sources, websites, etc)
first hand via a MT-driven tool set.
However, to be useful for translating specialized
content such as medical texts, we require that automatic translations be of the highest possible accuracy. To advance the research in Machine Translation, we require both high-quality benchmark sets
and access to basic training resources, both monolingual and parallel. Likewise, translation memories in a broader set of languages can help localizers around the world translate into these languages.
In the remainder of this paper we describe the
resources created by the TICO-19 initiative, and
some evaluations against them.

3 The TICO-19 Translation Benchmark
We created the TICO-19 benchmark with three
criteria in mind: diversity, relevance and quality.
First, we sampled from a variety of public sources
containing COVID-19 related content, representing different domains. Second, to make our content relevant for relief organizations, we chose the
languages to translate into based on the requests
from relief organizations on-the-ground. Third,
we established a stringent quality assurance process, to ensure that the content is translated according to the highest industry standard.
3.1 COVID-19 source data
The translation benchmark was created by combining English open-source data from various
sources, listed in Table 1. We took special care
to diversify the domains and sources of the data.
We provide a concise summary here and detailed
statistics for every source in Appendix A:

• CMU English-Haitian Creole dataset
(CMU): the data were originally collected at
Carnegie Mellon University13 and translated
into Haitian Creole by Eriksen Translations,
Inc. The dataset is comprised of medical
domain phrases and sentences, which along
other data were used to quickly build and deploy statistical MT systems in disaster-ridden
Haiti (Lewis, 2010) and later was part of
the 2011 Workshop of (Statistical) Machine
Translation Shared Tasks (Callison-Burch
et al., 2011). For our purposes, we subsampled the English conversational phrases
to only those including COVID-19-related
keywords taken from our terminologies (see
Section 4), ending up with 140 sentences.

3.2 Languages
We translated the above English data into 35
languages.18 In some cases, this was achieved
through pivot languages, i.e., the content was
translated into the pivot language first (e.g.,
French, Farsi) and then translated into the target
language (e.g., Congolese Swahili, Dari). The languages were selected according to various criteria, with the main consideration being the potential impact of our collected translations and the humanitarian priorities of TWB. The translation languages include:
• Pivots: 9 major languages which function as
a lingua franca for large parts of the globe:
Arabic (modern standard), Chinese (simplified), French, Brazilian Portuguese, Latin
American Spanish, Hindi, Russian, Swahili,
and Indonesian.
• Priority: 18 languages which TWB classified as high-priority, due to the large volume
of requests they are receiving and the strategic location of their partners (e.g. the Red
Cross). They include languages in Asia –
Dari, Central Khmer, Kurdish Kurmanji (in
the Latin script), Kurdish Sorani (Arabic
script), Nepali, Pashto– and Africa –Amharic,
Dinka, Nigerian Fulfulde, Hausa, Kanuri,
Kinyarwanda, Lingala, Luganda, Oromo, Somali, Ethiopian Tigrinya, Zulu.
18

Additional languages including Congolese Swahili,
Nuer, and Eritrean Tigrinya are in the works and will be
added to the collection soon.

Table 2: Samples of the English source sentences for the TICO-19 benchmark.

• Important: 8 additional languages spoken
by millions in South and South-East Asia:
Bengali, Burmese (Myanmar), Farsi, Malay,
Marathi, Tagalog, Tamil, and Urdu.
The latter two sets are primarily languages of
Africa, and South and South-East Asia, whose
communities, according to on-the-ground organizations, may be most susceptible to the spread of
the virus and its potentially disastrous ramifications, mostly due to lack of access to information
and communication in the community languages.
They are also overwhelmingly under-resourced
languages; in fact, some of the languages have remained untouched by the AI and MT communities,
and have no known tools or resources that have
been developed for them.
All of the test and development documents are
sentence aligned across all of the languages, which
allows for any pairing of languages for testing
or development purposes. This was done by design, in order to facilitate tool and resource development in and across any of the targeted languages. For example, an MT developer could
develop translation systems for French to/from
Congolese Swahili, Arabic to/from Kurdish, Urdu
to/from Pashto, Hindi to/from Marathi, Amharic
to/from Oromo, or Chinese to/from Malay, among

the 1296 possible pairings. Note that as the project
continues and as we create data for more languages we will keep updating this paper as well
as the project’s website.
3.3 Quality Assurance
It has been observed that translation from and into
low-resource languages requires additional automatic and manual quality checks (Guzmán et al.,
2019). To obtain the highest possible quality, here
we implemented a two-step human quality control
process. First, each document is sent for translation to language service providers (LSP), where
the translation is performed. After translation, the
dataset goes through a process of editing, in which
each sentence is thoroughly vetted by qualified
professionals familiar with the medical domain,
whenever available.19 In case of discrepancies, a
process of arbitration is followed to solve disagreements between translators and editors.
After editing, a selected fraction of the data
(18%, 558 sentences) undergoes a second independent quality assurance process. To ensure quality in the hardest-to-translate data, the scientific
medical content from PubMed was upsampled so
19

For a handful of languages, such as Dinka or Nuer, where
simply creating translations was a challenge, this process was,
by necessity, skipped.

that it comprises 329 of the 558 doubly-checked
sentences (almost 59%). The exact documents
that comprise our second quality assurance set are
listed in Appendix B.
The quality of the translations was checked, and
reworks were made until every translation set was
rated above 95% across all languages, before any
additional subsequent edits. Some low-resource
languages like Somali, Dari, Khmer, Amharic,
Tamil, Farsi, and Marathi required several rounds
of translation to reach acceptable performance.
The hardest part, unsurprisingly, proved to be the
PubMed portion of the benchmark. Our QA process revealed that in most cases the problems arose
when the translators did not have any medical expertise, which lead them to misunderstand the English source sentence and often opt for sub-par literal or word-for-word translations. We provide additional details with the estimated quality per language in the Appendix C. We note that all mistakes
identified in this subset have been corrected in the
final released dataset, and that all sentences that
underwent the QA process are part of the test portion of our benchmark.
We additionally release the sampled dataset
along with detailed error annotations and corrections. Whenever an error was noted in the validation sample, it was classified as one of the
following categories: Addition/Omission, Grammar, Punctuation, Spelling, Capitalization, Mistranslation, Unnatural translation, and Untranslated text. The severity of the error was also classified as minor, major, or critical. Although small in
size (at most 558 sentences in each translation direction), we hope that releasing these annotations
will also invite automatic quality estimation and
post-editing research for diverse under-resourced
languages.

4 Translator Resources
Translation Memories Because of the breadth
of languages covered by TICO-19, and the fact
that so many are under-resourced, the translations
themselves can be of significant value to localizers. As part of the effort, the TICO-19 collaborators have converted20 the translated data to
translation memories, cast as TMX files, for all
English–X pairings, as well as some other pairings
of languages focusing on potential local needs (e.g.
20
Conversion was carried out with the Tikal command included in the Okapi framework: https://okapiframework.org/.

French–Congolese Swahili, Farsi–Dari, and Kurdish Kurmanji–Sorani). These TMX files, in addition to the test and development data, have been
made available to the public through the project’s
website.
Terminologies Two sets of translation terminologies were provided by Facebook and Google
(the complete set of the English source terms
and of the translated languages are listed in Appendix D):
• the Facebook one includes 364 COVID19 related terms translated in 92 languages/locales.
• the Google one includes 300 COVID-19 related terms translated from English to 100
languages and a total of 1300 terms from 27
languages translated into English (for a total
of approximately 30k terms).
Additional Translations Translators without
Borders (TWB) worked with its network of translators to provide translations in hard-to-source languages (e.g. Congolese Swahili and Kanuri). It
also provided COVID-19 specific sources from
its diverse humanitarian partners to augment the
dataset. This augmented dataset will be available
under license on TWB’s Gamayun portal.21

5 MT Developer Resources
As part of our project the CMU team also collected
some COVID-19-related monolingual data in multiple languages. They are available online,22 but
we note that some of these data might not be available under the same license as our datasets (and
hence might not be appropriate for commercial
system development). These are detailed in the
next sections.
5.1 Monolingual
Wikipedia Data COVID-19-related data from
Wikipedia were scraped in 37 languages. COVID19 terms were used as queries (language specific,
in most cases), retrieving the textual data from the
returned articles (i.e. stripping out any Wikipedia
markup, metadata, images, etc). The data ranges
from less than 1K sentences (around 10K tokens)
for languages like Hindi, Bengali, or Afrikaans,
and for as much as 8K sentences for Spanish
(160K tokens) or Hungarian (120K tokens).
21
22

https://bit.ly/2ZLOkpo

News Data COVID-19-related news articles (as
identified by keyword search) were scraped from
three news organizations that publish multilingually through their world services. Specifically, the collected data include articles from the
BBC World Service23 (22 languages), the Voice
of America24 (31 languages), and the Deutsche
Welle25 (29 languages).
5.2

Parallel

We have also scraped a very small amount of available parallel data, mostly from public service announcements from NGOs and national/state government sources. Specifically, we scraped Public Service Announcements by the Canadian government26 in 21 languages (English, French, and
First Nations Languages), a fact sheet provided by
the King County (Washington, USA)27 in 12 languages, a COVID-19 advice sheet from the Doctors of the World28 in 47 languages, and data from
the COVID-19 Myth Busters in World Languages
project29 in 28 languages, and a medical prevention and treatment handbook from Zhejiang University School of Medicine30 in 10 languages. Unfortunately the total amount of data from these
sources do not exceed a few hundred sentences in
each direction, so they are not enough for system
development; they could, though, be potentially
useful as an additional smaller evaluation set or for
terminology extraction.

6 Baseline Results and Discussion
We present baseline results in some language directions, using the following systems:
1. For English to es, fr, pt, ru, sw, id, ln, lg,
mr and most opposite directions: we use the
OPUS-MT systems (Tiedemann and Thottingal, 2020) which are trained on the OPUS parallel data (Tiedemann, 2012a) using the Marian toolkit (Junczys-Dowmunt et al., 2018).
We also use the pretrained systems between
French and es, id, ln, lg, ru, rw.

the pre-trained Fairseq models that won the

year (Ng et al., 2019), as well as the English to French system of Ott et al. (2018).
For translation between English and Chinese
we also use a system trained on WMT’18
data (Bojar et al., 2018).
3. We train systems between English and ar, fa,
mr, om, zu on publicly available corpora from
OPUS (referred to as “our OPUS models”).
4. We train multilingual systems between English and hi, ms, and ur on a TED talks
dataset (Qi et al., 2018) (“our Multilingual
TED models”).
Results Table 3 presents results in translation
from English to all languages whose MT systems
we were able to train or use, while Table 4 includes
results in the opposite directions. Similarly, Tables 5 and 6 shows the quality of MT systems, as
measured on our test set, from and to French for
a few languages. All tables also include a breakdown of the quality for each test domain.31
Discussion First and foremost, the main takeaway from these baseline results lie not in the
above-mentioned Tables, but in the languages that
are not present in them. We were unable to find either pre-trained MT systems or publicly available
parallel data in order to train our own baselines
for Dari, Pashto, Tigrinya, Nigerian Fulfulde, Kurdish Sorani, Myanmar, Oromo, Dinka, Nuer, and
isiZulu.32 This highlights the need for serious data
collection efforts to expand the availability of data
for large swathes of under-represented communities and languages.
Beyond this obvious limitation, the existing systems’ results highlight the divide between highresource language pairs and low-resource ones.
For all European languages (Spanish, French, Portuguese, Russian) as well as for Chinese and Indonesian, MT produces very competitive results
with BLEU scores between 25 and 49.33 In contrast, the output translations for languages like Lingala, Luganda, Marathi, or Urdu are quite disap31
Note, however, that each sub-domain posits a smaller test
set than the complete set, and hence any result should properly take into account statistical significance measures.
32
Note that although a small amount of parallel data exists for English-isiZulu, Abbott and Martinus (2019) report
very low results on general benchmarks as the parallel data
requires cleaning.
33
Note that BLEU scores on test sets on different languages (e.g. in Tables 3 and 5) are not directly comparable.

pointing, with extremely low BLEU scores under
10. The existence of pre-trained systems or of parallel data, hence, is not enough; this level of quality is basically unusable for any real-world deployment either for translators or for end-users.
A comparison of the results across different domains is also revealing. BLEU scores are generally higher on Wikipedia and news articles; this is
unsurprising, as most MT systems rely on such domains for training, as they naturally produce parallel or quasi-parallel data. Our PubMed data pose a
more challenging setting, but perhaps not as challenging as we initially expected, although the results vary across languages. In translating from
English to French, for instance, the difference between Wikipedia and PubMed is more than 14
BLEU points,34 while the differences are smaller
for e.g. Indonesian-English (6 BLEU points) or
Russian-English (4 BLEU points).
Future Work Several concrete steps have the
potential to improve MT for all languages in our
benchmark. All results we report are with MT systems trained on general domain data or in particularly out-of-domain data (such as TED talks); domain adaptation techniques using small in-domain
parallel resources or monolingual source- or targetside data should be able to increase performance.
Incorporating the terminologies as part of the training and the inference schemes of the models could
also ensure faithful and consistent translations of
the COVID-19-specific scientific terms that might
not naturally appear in other training data or might
appear in different contexts.
Another direction for improvement involves
multilingual NMT models trained on massive webbased corpora (Aharoni et al., 2019), which have
improved translation accuracy particularly for languages in the lower end of data availability. Also
viable are methods relying on multilingual model
transfer, which can target languages with extremely small amounts of data, as in Chen et al.
(2018).
Lastly, we need to improve the representation
of low resource languages in public domain corpora. While there are open data collections
in OPUS (Tiedemann, 2012b), and mined corpora like Paracrawl (Esplà et al., 2019), WikiMatrix (Schwenk et al., 2019), they don’t cover
enough low-resource languages. We hope that the
34
We note again that these scores are not directly comparable as the underlying test data are different.

availability of multilingual representations such
as Multilingual BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) and
XML-R (Conneau et al., 2019) will empower
the creation of parallel corpora for low resource
languages through low-resource corpus filtering
(Koehn et al., 2019) or other approaches.

7 Conclusion
Enabling efficient and accurate communication
through translations still has a ways to go for the
majority of the world’s languages and particularly
the most vulnerable ones. With this effort we only
address a fraction of the needs for a fraction of
the world’s languages. Nevertheless, we hope that
the MT Resources that we release will have an immediate impact for the languages we cover. More
importantly, the benchmark we release will allow
the MT research community, both academic and
industrial, to be more prepared for the next crisis
where translation technologies will be needed.

Acknowledgements
We would like to thank the people who made this
effort possible: Tanya Badeka, Jen Wang, William
Wong, Rebekkah Hogan, Cynthia Gao, Rachael
Brunckhorst, Ian Hill, Bob Jung, Jason Smith, Susan Kim Chan, Romina Stella, Keith Stevens. We
also extend our gratitude to the many translators
and the quality reviewers whose hard work are represented in our benchmarks and in our translation
memories. Some of the languages were very difficult to source, and the burden in these cases often fell to a very small number of translators. We
thank you for the many hours you spent translating
and, in many cases, re-translating content.

B Quality Assurance Documents
The 558 sentences of our quality assurance set are comprised of examples from almost all subdomains
of the corpus. Specifically, it includes 40 sentences from the conversational data, one PubMed document
(PubMed 8), two of the Wikinews documents (Wikinews 1, Wikinews 3) and one complete Wikipedia
article (Wikipedia handpicked 4).

C

Expected Quality per Language

For all translation directions the quality was quite good, with average quality scores above 95%. The
detailed list of the quality evaluations on our sampled documents, which can be considered a proxy for
the overall translation quality of our whole dataset, is available in Table 8.

Average QA score (final):
Table 8: QA score across languages. We report the initial QA score and whether re-work was required on the
produced translations (beyond the QA sample, due to serious translation errors). In cases where the initial QA
yielded very poor results, the translations were corrected in their entirety and a new QA process was performed,
and we report both the initial and the final QA results. Note: a ”N/A” final QA score in the score indicates that the
final score is temporarily not available and we will report it in an updated version of the paper.
