Abstract

arXiv:2005.11856v3 [eess.IV] 30 Jun 2020

Purpose: The need to streamline patient management for COVID-19 has become more pressing
than ever. Chest X-rays provide a non-invasive
(potentially bedside) tool to monitor the progression of the disease. In this study, we present a
severity score prediction model for COVID-19
pneumonia for frontal chest X-ray images. Such a
tool can gauge severity of COVID-19 lung infections (and pneumonia in general) that can be used
for escalation or de-escalation of care as well as
monitoring treatment efficacy, especially in the
ICU.
Methods: Images from a public COVID-19
database were scored retrospectively by three
blinded experts in terms of the extent of lung involvement as well as the degree of opacity. A neural network model that was pre-trained on large
(non-COVID-19) chest X-ray datasets is used to
construct features for COVID-19 images which
are predictive for our task.
Results: This study finds that training a regression model on a subset of the outputs from an this
pre-trained chest X-ray model predicts our geographic extent score (range 0-8) with 1.14 mean
absolute error (MAE) and our lung opacity score
(range 0-6) with 0.78 MAE.
Conclusions: These results indicate that our models ability to gauge severity of COVID-19 lung
infections could be used for escalation or deescalation of care as well as monitoring treatment efficacy, especially in the intensive care unit
(ICU). A proper clinical trial is needed to evaluate
efficacy. To enable this we make our code, labels,
and data available online at GitHub:covid-severity
and GitHub:covid-chestxray-dataset

1. Introduction
As the first countries explore deconfinement strategies [Wilson & Moulson, 2020] the death toll of COVID-19 keeps
rising [O’Grady et al., 2020]. The increased strain caused
by the pandemic on healthcare systems worldwide has
prompted many physicians to resort to new strategies and
technologies. Chest X-rays (CXRs) provide a non-invasive
(potentially bedside) tool to monitor the progression of the
disease [Yoon et al., 2020; Ng et al., 2020]. As early as
March 2020, Chinese hospitals used artificial intelligence
(AI)-assisted computed tomography (CT) imaging analysis
to screen COVID-19 cases and streamline diagnosis [Jin
et al., 2020]. Many teams have since launched AI initiatives
to improve triaging of COVID-19 patients (i.e., discharge,
general admission or ICU care) and allocation of hospital
resources (i.e., direct non-invasive ventilation to invasive
ventilation) [Strickland, 2020]. While these recent tools
exploit clinical data, practically deployable CXR-based predictive models remain lacking.
In this work, we build and study a model which predicts the
severity of COVID-19 pneumonia, based on CXRs, to be
used as an assistive tool when managing patient care. The
ability to gauge severity of COVID-19 lung infections can
be used for escalation or de-escalation of care, especially
in the ICU. An automated tool can be applied to patients
over time to objectively and quantitatively track disease
progression and treatment response.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. COVID-19 Cohort
We used a retrospective cohort of 94 posteroanterior (PA)
CXR images from a public COVID-19 image data collection [Cohen et al., 2020b]. While the dataset currently
contains 153 images, it only counted 94 images at the time
of the experiment, all of which were included in the study.
All patients were reported COVID-19 positive and sourced
from many hospitals around the world from December 2019
to March 2020. The images were de-identified prior to
our use and there was no missing data. The ratio between
male/female was 44/36 with an average age of 56±14.8
(55±15.6 for male and 57±13.9 for female).

2.2. Labels

2.4. Model, Preprocessing, and Pre-Training

Radiological scoring was performed by three blinded experts: two chest radiologists (each with at least 20 years of
experience) and a radiology resident. They staged disease
severity using a score system adapted from [Wong et al.,
2019], based on two types of scores (parameters): extent of
lung involvement and degree of opacity.

In this study, we used a DenseNet model [Huang et al., 2017]
from the TorchXRayVision library [Cohen et al., 2020c;a].
DenseNet models have been shown to predict Pneumonia
well [Rajpurkar et al., 2017]. Images were resized to 224
224 pixels, utilizing a center crop if the aspect ratio was
uneven, and the pixel values were scaled to [-1024, 1024]
for the training. More details about the training can be found
in [Cohen et al., 2020a].

1. The extent of lung involvement by ground glass opacity
or consolidation for each lung (right lung and left lung
separately) was scored as: 0 = no involvement; 1 =
<25% involvement; 2 = 25-50% involvement; 3 = 5075% involvement; 4 = >75% involvement. The total
extent score ranged from 0 to 8 (right lung and left
lung together).
2. The degree of opacity for each lung (right lung and left
lung separately) was scored as: 0 = no opacity; 1 =
ground glass opacity; 2 = consolidation; 3 = white-out.
The total opacity score ranged from 0 to 6 (right lung
and left lung together).
A spreadsheet was maintained to pair filenames with their
respective scores. Fleiss Kappa for inter-rater agreement
was 0.45 for the opacity score and 0.71 for the extent score..
2.3. Non-COVID-19 (Pre-Training) Datasets
Prior to the experiment, the model was trained on the following public datasets, none of which contained COVID-19
cases:
1. RSNA Pneumonia Challenge [Shih et al., 2019];
2. CheXpert - Stanford University[Irvin et al., 2019];
3. ChestX-ray8 - National Institutes of Health (NIH)
[Wang et al., 2017];
4. ChestX-ray8 - NIH with labels from Google [Majkowska et al., 2019];
5. MIMIC-CXR - MIT [Johnson et al., 2019];
6. PadChest - University of Alicante [Bustos et al., 2019];
7. OpenI [Demner-Fushman et al., 2016]
These seven datasets were manually aligned to each other
on 18 common radiological finding tasks in order to train
a model using all datasets at once (atelectasis, consolidation, infiltration, pneumothorax, edema, emphysema, fibrosis, fibrosis, effusion, pneumonia, pleural thickening, cardiomegaly, nodule, mass, hernia, lung lesion, fracture, lung
opacity, and enlarged cardiomediastinum). For example
“pleural effusion” from one dataset is considered the same
as “effusion” from another dataset in order to consider these
labels equal. In total, 88,079 non-COVID-19 images were
used to train the model on these tasks.

Before even processing the COVID-19 images, a pretraining step was performed using the seven datasets to train
feature extraction layers and a task prediction layer (shown
in Figure 1). This “pre-training” step was performed on a
large set of data in order to construct general representations
about lungs and other aspects of CXRs that we would have
been unable to achieve on the small set of COVID-19 images available. Some of these representations are expected
to be relevant to our downstream tasks. There are a few
ways we can extract useful features from the pre-trained
model as detailed in Figure 1.
2.5. Training
Similarly to the images from non-COVID-19 datasets used
for pre-training, each image from the COVID-19 dataset
was preprocessed (resized, centercropped, rescaled), then
processed by the feature extraction layers and the task prediction layer of the network. The network was trained on
existing datasets before the weights were frozen. COVID-19
images were processed by the network to generate features
used in place of the images. As was the case with images
from the seven non-COVID-19 datasets, the feature extraction layers produced a representation of the 94 COVID-19
images using a 1024 dimensional vector, then the fully connected task prediction layer produced outputs for each of
the 18 original tasks. We build models on the pre-sigmoid
outputs.
Linear regression was performed to predict the aforementioned scores (extent of lung involvement and opacity) using
these different sets of features in place of the image itself:
1. Intermediate network features - the result of the convolutional layers applied to the image resulting in a
1024 dimensional vector which is passed to the task
prediction layer;
2. 18 outputs - each image was represented by the 18
outputs (pre-sigmoid) from the pre-trained model;
3. 4 outputs - a hand picked subset of outputs (presigmoid) were used containing radiological findings
more frequent in pneumonia (lung opacity, pneumonia,
infiltration, and consolidation);
4. Lung opacity output - the single output (pre-sigmoid)
for lung opacity was used because it was task related.
This is different from the predicted opacity score.

Predicting COVID-19 Pneumonia Severity on Chest X-ray with Deep Learning

Figure 1. Detail of the different features being used. The two dataset blocks show that COVID-19 images were not used to train the neural
network. The network diagram is split into 3 sections. The feature extraction layers are convolutional layers which transform the image
into a 1024 dimensional vector which is called the intermediate network features. These features are then transformed using the task
prediction layer (a sigmoid function for each task) into the outputs for each task. The different groupings of outputs used in this work are
shown.

For each experiment performed, the 94 images COVID-19
dataset was randomly split into a train and test set roughly
50/50. Multiple timepoints from the same patient were
grouped together into the same split so that a patient did not
span both sets. Sampling was repeated throughout training
in order to obtain a mean and standard deviation for each
performance. As linear regression was used, there was no
early stopping that had to be done to prevent the model
from overfitting. Therefore, the criterion for determining
the final model was only the mean squared error (MSE) on
the training set.
2.6. Saliency maps
In order to ensure that the models are looking at reasonable
aspects of the images [Reed & Marks, 1999; Zech et al.,
2018; Viviano et al., 2019], a saliency map is computed by
computing the gradient of the output prediction with respect
to the input image (if a pixel is changed how much will it
change the prediction). In order to smooth out the saliency
map, it is blurred using a 5x5 Gaussian kernel. Keep in mind
that these saliency maps have limitations and only offer a
restricted view into why a model made a prediction [Ross
et al., 2017; Viviano et al., 2019].

3. Results
Quantitative performance metrics The single “lung opacity” output as a feature yielded the best correlation (0.80),
followed by 4 outputs (lung opacity, pneumonia, infiltration,
and consolidation) parameters (0.79) (Table 1). Building a

model on only a few outputs provides the best performance.
The mean absolute error (MAE) is useful to understand the
error in units of the scores that are predicted while the mean
squared error (MSE) helps to rank the different methods
based on their furthest outliers. One possible reason that
fewer features work best is that having fewer parameters
prevents overfitting. Some features could serve as proxy
variables to confounding attributes such as sex or age and
preventing these features from being used prevents the distraction from hurting generalization performance. Hand
selecting feature subsets which are intuitively related to
this task imparts domain knowledge as a bias on the model
which improves performance. Thus, the top performing
model (using the single “lung opacity” output as a feature)
is used for the subsequent qualitative analysis.
Qualitative analysis of predicted scores Figure 2 shows
the top performing model’s (using the single “lung opacity” output as a feature) predictions against the ground truth
score (given by the blinded experts) on held out test data.
Majority of the data points fall close to the line of unity. The
model overestimates scores between 1 and 3 and underestimates scores above 4. However, generally the predictions
seem reasonable given the agreement of the raters.
Studying learned representations In Figure 3, we explore
what the representation used by one of the best models looks
at in order to identify signs of overfitting and to gain insights
into the variation of the data. A t-distributed stochastic
neighbor embedding (t-SNE) [van der Maaten & Hinton,
2008] is computed on all data (even those not scored) in

order to project the features into a two-dimensional (2D)
space. Each CXR is represented by a point in a space where
relationships to other points are preserved from the higher
dimensional space. The cases of the survival group tend to
cluster together as well as the cases of the deceased group.
This clustering indicates that score predictions align with
clinical outcomes.
Inspecting saliency maps In Figure 4, images are studied
which were not seen by the model during training. For
most of the results, the model is correctly looking at opaque
regions of the lungs. Figure 4b shows no signs of opacity
and the model is focused on the heart and diaphragm, which
is likely a sign that they are used as a color reference when
determining what qualifies as opaque. In Figure 4c and 4d,

we see erroneous predictions.

4. Discussion
Existing work focuses on predicting severity from a variety
of clinical indicators which include findings from chest
imaging [Jiang et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2020]. Models such as
the one presented in this work can complement and improve
these models and potentially help to make decisions from
CXR as opposed to CT.
Challenges in creating a predictive model involve labelling
the data and achieving good inter-rater agreement as well
as learning a representation which will generalize to new
images when the number of labelled images is so low. In
the case of building a predictive tool for COVID-19 CXR

other. Features are extracted for all 208 images in the dataset and the geographic extent prediction is shown for each image. The survival

images, the lack of a public database made it difficult to
conduct large-scale robust evaluations. This small number
of samples prevents proper cohort selection which is a limitation of this study and exposes our evaluation to sample
bias. However, we use a model which was trained on a large
dataset with related tasks which provided us with a robust
unbiased COVID-19 feature extractor and allows us to learn
only two parameters for our best linear regression model.
Restricting the complexity of the learned model in this way
reduces the possibility of overfitting.
Our evaluation could be improved if we were able to obtain
new cohorts labelled with the same severity score to ascertain the generalization of our model. Also, it is unknown
if these radiographic scores of disease severity reflect actual functional or clinical outcomes as the open data do not
have those data. We make the images, labels, model, and
code public from this work so that other groups can perform
follow-up evaluations.

5. Conclusion
In the context of a pandemic and the urgency to contain
the crisis, research has increased exponentially in order to
alleviate the healthcare systems burden. However, many
prediction models for diagnosis and prognosis of COVID19 infection are at high risk of bias and model overfitting
as well as poorly reported, their alleged performance being
likely optimistic [Wynants et al., 2020]. In order to prevent premature implementation in hospitals [Ross, 2020],
tools must be robustly evaluated along several practical axes
[Wiens et al., 2019; Ghassemi et al., 2019; Cohen et al.,
2020a]. Indeed, while some AI-assisted tools might be
powerful, they do not replace clinical judgment and their diagnostic performance cannot be assessed or claimed without
a proper clinical trial [Nagendran et al., 2020].
Our models ability to gauge severity of COVID-19 lung
infections could be used for escalation or de-escalation of
care as well as monitoring treatment efficacy, especially in
the intensive care unit (ICU) [Toussie et al., 2020]. The
use of a score combining geographical extent and degree of
opacity allows clinicians to compare CXR images with each
other using a quantitative and objective measure. Also, this
can be done at scale for a large scale analysis.
