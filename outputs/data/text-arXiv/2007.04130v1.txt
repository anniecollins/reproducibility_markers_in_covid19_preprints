Socio-economic disparities quite often have a central role in the unfolding of large-scale catastrophic events. One of the most concerning aspects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemics [1] is that
it disproportionately affects people from Black and African American backgrounds [2–6], creating
an unexpected infection gap. Interestingly, the abnormal impact on these ethnic groups seem to
be almost uncorrelated with other risk factors, including co-morbidity, poverty, level of education,
access to healthcare, residential segregation, and response to cures [7–11]. A proposed explanation
for the observed incidence gap is that people from African American backgrounds are more often
employed in low-income service jobs, and are thus more exposed to infection through face-to-face
contacts [12], but the lack of direct data has not allowed to draw strong conclusions in this sense so
far. Here we introduce the concept of dynamic segregation, that is the extent to which a given group
of people is internally clustered or exposed to other groups, as a result of mobility and commuting
habits. By analysing census and mobility data on more than 120 major US cities, we found that the
dynamic segregation of African American communities is significantly associated with the weekly
excess COVID-19 incidence and mortality in those communities. The results confirm that knowing
where people commute to, rather than where they live, is much more relevant for disease modelling.

The spread of a non-air-borne virus like COVID-19
is mostly mediated by direct face-to-face contacts with
other infected people. This is why the first measures attempting at containing the spread of the virus included
the introduction of travel restrictions, social distancing,
curfews, and stay-at-home orders [13–16]. However, the
distribution of the number of contacts per person is
known to be fat-tailed [17], so that most of the infections
are actually caused by a relatively small set of individuals, called super-spreaders [18, 19], who normally have a
disproportionately high number of face-to-face contacts.
Intuitively enough, super-spreaders are most commonly
found among service workers –cashiers, postmen, clerks,
cooks, bus drivers, waiters, etc.– since their job involves
being in direct contact with a large number of people
on a regular basis. This fact makes super-spreaders
more prone to catch diseases that propagate preferentially through direct contacts, like COVID-19 does, and
–involuntarily– more efficient at spreading them.
The fact that mainly African Americans seem to
be affected by such a markedly unusual COVID-19
incidence[20–22], rather than, say, people with lowincome, little access to healthcare, or with other increased risk factors [7–11], points to ethnic segregation,
i.e., the tendency of people belonging to the same ethnic
group to live closer in space, as a possible culprit [23–
27]. Indeed, ethnic segregation is long-standing problem
across the US [28], so the idea that the abnormal proportion of COVID-19 infections among African Americans
could be due to spatial segregation does not sound unreasonable. However, the results available so far confirm
that, although there is a correlation between ethnic segregation and overall incidence of COVID-19 in the population, there seems to be little evidence of an association
with infection gap in African Americans [29].
Our hypothesis is that the observed infection gap is

most probably due to a prevalence of super-spreading behaviours in African American communities, i.e., activities that contribute to increase the typical number and
variety of face-to-face contacts of individuals —including
for instance their job, habits, social life, commuting and
mobility patterns— and that effectively make them more
exposed to the infection. In particular, we argue that
these super-spreading behaviours are connected to the
presence of what we call dynamic segregation. By dynamic segregation we mean the extent to which individuals of a certain class or group are either preferentially exposed to other groups, or internally clustered, as a result
of their mobility patterns. In this sense, dynamic segregation is somehow complementary to the classical notion
of segregation based on residential data, and is instead
related with similar measures of segregation based on the
concept of activity space [30]. In principle, the fact that a
certain residential neighbourhood has an overabundance
of people belonging to a single ethnic group might have
per se little or no role in increasing the probability that
those people catch COVID-19. Conversely, the fact that
a group of people works preferentially in specific sectors,
or in specific areas of a city, almost automatically increases the typical number of face-to-face contacts they
have during a day, e.g., by forcing them to commute long
distances in packed public transport services.

Model

We quantify the dynamic segregation of a certain group
in a urban area by means of the typical time needed by
individuals of that group to get in touch with individuals
of other groups when they move around the city. In our

(here indicated by different colours) visited by a random walk over a the adjacency network or f the commuting network among
census tracts of a city retains relevant information about the presence of spatial correlations in ethnicity distribution. Indeed,

random walk exhibit different patterns in different cities, and reveal different kinds of ethnic correlations in the adjacency and
in the commuting network of the same city. We show here the values for Chicago or Los Angeles, since Illinois and California
have, respectively, one of the highest and one of the lowest COVID-19 incidence gap. Indeed, the mean first passage time from
African American to White neighbourhoods in the adjacency graph is much higher in Chicago than in Los Angeles, while the
commuting graphs reveals that African Americans are much more exposed to all the other ethnicities in Chicago than in Los
Angeles.

model, a city is represented by a graph G where nodes
are census tracts and each edge indicates a relation between two areas, namely either physical adjacency or the
existence of commuting flows between them. Each node
is assigned to a class, according to the ethnicity distribution in the corresponding area (see Methods for details).
Then, we consider a random walk on the graph G, and we
look at the statistics of Class Mean First Passage Times
(CMFPT) and Class Coverage Times (CCT). The former
is the number of steps needed to a walker starting on a
node of a certain class α to end up for the first time on
a node of class β, while the latter is related to the time
needed to a random walk to visit all the classes in the
system (see Methods for details). The underlying idea is

that a random walk through the graph preserves most of
the information about correlations and heterogeneity of
node classes [31]. Consequently, if a system is dynamically segregated, the statistics of CMFPT and CCT will
be substantially different from those observed on a nullmodel graph having exactly the same set of nodes and
edges, but where a node is assigned a class at random
from the underlying ethnicity distribution.
In Fig. 1 we provide a visual sketch of the model and we
show the distributions of CMFPT and CCT in Chicago
and Los Angeles. We chose these two specific cities since
Illinois and California are two states respectively characterised by a relatively high and a relatively low incidence
gap [32, 33] (a detail of incidence gap across US states

FIG. 2. Correlation between incidence gap and dynamic segregation in the early stages of the epidemics.
The incidence gap ∆Ainf across US states in the first two weeks after extensive lock-down measures were enforced exhibits
somehow strong correlation with measure of segregation based on CMFPT and CCT on the adjacency (panels a-d) and on the
commuting graphs (panels e-h). In particular, the dynamic clustering C (a,e) is always positively correlated with ∆Ainf , the
the dynamic exposure E (b,f ) is positively correlated with ∆Ainf only in the commuting network, and the dynamic isolation
I (c,g) is negatively associated with incidence gap only in the adjacency network. Notice that classical measures of residential
segregation, like the Spatial Gini coefficient (d,h), are instead poorly or not correlated at all with incidence gap. Each colour
corresponds to a temporal snapshot of the data set, red for 12/04/2020 and blue for 19/04/2020. (*: p < 0.05,**: p < 0.01,
***: p < 0.001)

is available in Supplementary Figures 18-19). Here each
node is associated to one of the seven high-level ethnic
groups defined by the US Census Borough [34], with a
probability proportional to the abundance of that ethnicity in the corresponding census tract. The variables
of interest are τeαβ and γ
eα . These are, respectively, the
ratio of the CMFPT from class α to class β in the real
system and in the null-model, and the ratio of the CCT
when the walker starts from class α in the real system
and in the null model (see Eq. 8 and Eq. 10 in Methods).
In short, the farther away τeα,β is from 1, the higher the
dynamic segregation from class α to class β. Similarly,
the higher the value of γ
eα the more isolated ethnicity α
is from all the other ones.
The top panels of Fig. 1 correspond to the unweighted
network A of physical adjacency between census tracts,
while the bottom panels are obtained on the weighted
network C of typical daily commute flows among the same
set of census tracts [35] (see Methods for details). Notice
that the two graphs have quite different structures: the
adjacency graph is planar and each edge connects only
nodes that are physically close, while in the commuting graph long edges between physically separated tracts
are not only possible, but quite frequent. As a consequence, the adjacency graph provides information about

short trips, e.g., for daily shopping and access to local services, while the commuting graph represents long-range
trips, e.g., related to commuting to and from work. It is
clear that each ethnicity has a peculiar pattern of passage times to the other ethnicities, and this pattern varies
across cities. For instance, in Chicago the two largest
values of τeαβ on the adjacency graph are observed between African Americans and White, and between Asian
and African Americans. Conversely, in Los Angeles the
two largest values of τeαβ are between African American
and Asian and between Other and Asian. As expected,
the profile of τeαβ for a given class is quite different if we
consider the commuting network instead of the adjacency
graph. In Chicago, the largest value of τeαβ is from White
to African American, while in Los Angeles there are a lot
of pairs of classes with pretty similar values of τeαβ , indicating that in this city dynamic segregation for African
Americans is less prominent than in Chicago. The value
of γ
eα for African Americans is especially low in Chicago,
but noticeably different from that of the other ethnicities
in Los Angeles. Results for other cities are discussed in
Appendix A Supplementary Figures 1-4. As we shall see
in a moment, γ
eα is related to the isolation of a class, so
that lower values correspond to increased exposure to all
the other classes.

FIG. 3. Distribution of local dynamic segregation. The distribution of the fraction of African American population living
in each census tract (panels a,f ) is mostly unrelated to the local clustering index ξei (panels b,d,g,i) and to the local isolation
index ψei (panels c,e,h,j). The figure shows the result for Chicago (top panels) and for Los Angeles (bottom panels). Overall,
there is little correlation between the density of African American residents and the dynamic segregation of African Americans
in an area. This explains why dynamic segregation indices in a city correlate quite strongly with the COVID-19 infection gap,
while no strong association with residential segregation has been found so far.

B.

Dynamic segregation and infection gap

Starting from the statistics of CMFPT and CCT at
the level of each city, we defined three indices of dynamic segregation, namely dynamic clustering (C), dynamic exposure (E), and dynamic isolation (I), and we
associated to each state in the US the weighted average
of each of those indices across the largest metropolitan
areas of the state (the definitions of these measures are
provided in Methods, while a ranking of US states by
each segregation index is reported in Appendix B and in
Supplementary Figure 5). We considered two temporal
data sets of weekly percentage of African Americans infected by and deceased due to COVID-19 for each state
in the US [32, 33] (more details available in Methods),
and we calculated the incidence gap ∆Ainf in each state
as the difference between the percentage of infected of
that state that are African Americans and the percentage of African American population in the same state.
Hence, Positive values of ∆Ainf correspond to a disproportionate incidence of COVID-19 on African American
communities.
In Fig. 2 we show the scatter plots of the average
dynamic clustering, exposure, and isolation of African
Americans at state level, and of the corresponding
COVID-19 infection gap in the first two weeks after major lock-down measures were introduced across the US.
We chose these two temporal snapshots because the number of confirmed infected individuals in a week actually
depends on their contacts up to two weeks before, due
to the COVID-19 incubation period [36]. The top panels
report the results on the adjacency networks of census

tracts, while the bottom panels are for the commuting
graphs. Interestingly, there exists a quite strong correlation between dynamic segregation and the disproportionate number of infected in African American communities.
In particular, the dynamic clustering of African Americans in a state correlates positively and quite strongly
with the infection gap observed in that state in the first
two weeks of the data set, both on the adjacency (respectively R2 = 0.58 and R2 = 0.44 in the first two weeks)
and in the commuting network (respectively R2 = 0.60
and R2 = 0.50). This means that if African American
citizens normally require more time than citizens from
other ethnic groups before ending up in a non-African
American neighbourhood, then the incidence gap will be
considerably higher.
The role of dynamic exposure is even more interesting.
Indeed, the dynamic exposure on the adjacency network
is not correlated at all with incidence gap, while it is a
good predictor of incidence gap in the commuting graph
(respectively R2 = 0.40 and R2 = 0.36). Conversely,
the dynamic isolation of African Americans in the adjacency graph is negatively correlated with incidence gap
in the early stages of the epidemics (R2 = 0.31). Similar results are obtained when we consider the correlation with the death gap ∆Adec , and the ratios of infection/deaths incidence instead of the difference (see Supplementary Figures 8-10). In particular, dynamic isolation exhibits a somehow stronger correlation with death
gap (R2 = 0.27). It is worth noting that the isolation of
other ethnicities has poor or no correlation with incidence
gap (see Supplementary Figures 11-14).
The fact that ethnic segregation does not correlate
with infection gap as much as dynamic segregation in-

temporal reporting of ethnicity data, each temporal snapshot has a slightly different number of US states (details provided in
Supplementary Figure 17). We have also tried alternative formulations for C and E obtaining significant correlations, as shown
in Supplementary Figure 27.

dices can bet better explained by looking at how residential data and dynamic segregation are distributed across
a city. In Fig. 3 we show the heat-maps of abundance
of African American residents in Chicago and Los Angeles together with the local segregation indices ξei and
ψei , respectively derived from passage times and coverage
times, on the adjacency and on the commuting graph of
census tracts (see the definitions provided in Methods,
additional maps for Detroit and Houston are reported
in Appendix C and Supplementary Figure 15). It is true
that in Chicago ξei in the adjacency graph is still somehow
correlated with the fraction of African American population (see Supplementary Figure 16). But the distribution
of ξei in the commuting graph is totally different. In particular, the regions characterised by residential clusters
of African Americans exhibit lower values of ξei , meaning that the commuting patterns make those neighbourhoods overall less isolated. Conversely, new hot-spots are
identified in the South-Eastern region of Gary, likely due
to the fact that people in this region do not commute
much to the city centre anyway. Similarly, the areas
of Los Angeles with the largest local isolation are not
the neighbourhoods with a higher percentage of African
Americans residents, rather the suburbs characterised by

high commuting.

C.

Combined effects of dynamic segregation and
use of public transport

Finally, in Fig. 4a-d we show the correlation between
the infection gap and the different segregation measures
as the pandemic progresses. Unsurprisingly, the correlation with any single measure decreases over time for
all the indices, and both on the adjacency and on the
commuting graph. Similar results are found for the correlation with death gap and with ratios of incidence
and deaths in African Americans (see Appendix D and
Supplementary Figures 20-22) as well as with a second
dataset we had access to [33] (see Supplementary Figures 23-26). The main reason for the observed decreases
is that once large-scale mobility restrictions are put in
place —as it happened between the end of March and
the beginning of April across all the US states with stayat-home orders and curfews— the overall mobility structure of each city is massively disrupted. As a result,
super-spreading behaviours due to usual commuting patterns are massively reduced, and the contagion progresses
mainly through face-to-face interactions happening close

6
to the residential place of each individual, and are not
captured well by CMFPT and CCT on the commuting
graph.
In order to capture the focus on local transport after
lock-downs are enforced, in Fig. 4e-h we show the results
of the multivariate analysis of the same set of segregation
indices shown in Fig. 2 and of the fraction of African
American population using public transport in each city
(see Methods for details). The combination of dynamic
segregation and use of public transport correlates quite
consistently with the incidence gap. These findings are
made more relevant by the fact that the incidence gap
in African Americans in the same period is quite poorly
correlated with the overall usage of public transport in
the population, as well as with a variety of other socioeconomic indices, as shown in Supplementary Figures 3031. Since cities are complex interconnected systems, it
is plausible to hypothesise that segregation and public
transport usage are related in subtle and intricate ways,
so that it is practically impossible to establish whether
the former has caused the latter, or instead the two phenomena have co-evolved over time.

DISCUSSION

The vulnerability of African American communities
and their higher socio-economic disparities has been a
standing issue in the US long before the pandemic, the
disproportional infection rates simple highlighted and
amplified the problem. The presence of a COVID-19
incidence gap in Black and African American population is somehow unexpected, since no specific biological
risk factor has been strongly associated with an increased
vulnerability to the virus of any specific ethnic group.
Hence, the most unbiased assumption to explain such a
disproportionate incidence, which in some areas is three
to five times higher than the fraction of African American
population, is that it should be related to behavioural
and social factors, rather than to biological ones. The
most frequently whispered theory is that African Americans are more exposed to COVID-19 because they are
more frequently employed in service works. This explanation is indeed reasonable, since service workers normally have hundreds of face-to-face interactions during
a day. Indeed, some recent studies have estimated that
the switching to remote-working was mainly available to
people employed in non-essential services, and amounted
to 22%-25% of the work force before April [37]. As expected, service workers are one of those categories to
which the option to switching to remote-working during the lock-down was not available at all, especially in
sectors deemed vital for the functioning of a country during lock-down, including food production and retailers,
healthcare, transportation, and logistics. According to
the US Labor Force Statistics [38], the occupations with
the highest concentration of African Americans are indeed jobs characterised by face-to-face interaction, and

most of them fall in the area of essential jobs: postal
service sorters/processors (42%), nursing (37%), postal
service clerks (35%), protective service workers (34%)
and barbers (32%). It would not then come as a surprise
to discover that one of the major early COVID-19 outbreaks happened in South Dakota, in a meat-processing
plant, whose workers were mainly of African American
background [39].
The potential relation between ethnicity and mobility
was somehow hinted to in a recent study [40] which found
that the decrease in the usage of subway transport in New
York during the lock-down was uneven across ethnicities,
with African Americans experiencing the smallest relative drop. But unfortunately, the publicly available data
about COVID-19 incidence do not contain detailed information about socio-economic characteristics of infected
individuals, so drawing an association between African
Americans, employment in essential service jobs, availability of remote-working options, and increased COVID19 exposure is very hard.
An interesting finding of the present work is that the
combination of dynamic segregation and use of public
transport seems to explain the persistence of infection
gap throughout the early phases of the pandemic. Indeed, before lock-downs are put in place, African Americans are found to be more exposed to the virus, mainly
due to the structure of their daily commuting patterns.
After lock-downs are enforced, instead, they are more
likely to pass the virus over to other African Americans,
as a result of the high levels of clustering and isolation of
these communities measured in the adjacency graphs of
census tracts, which are a more reliable proxy for faceto-face interactions when long-distance commuting is disrupted. In general, the states where African Americans
are more exposed with respect to long-distance trips are
also those where they are more clustered with respect to
short-range mobility (the rank correlation between the
two measures is 0.62, as shown in Supplementary Figure
6-7 and Supplementary Table I).
The importance of considering the interaction of different classes due to mobility through the urbanscape
has recently received some attention [30, 41–46]. In this
sense, it is quite interesting that the simple diffusion
model we used here to quantify the presence of dynamic
segregation, and the corresponding indices of clustering,
exposure, and isolation, are able to unveil a relatively
strong correlation between the structure of mobility in a
metropolitan area and the excess incidence of COVID-19
infections and deaths in African Americans. Although
the model we consider uses relatively small and coarsegrained information about a city —placement of census
tracts, local ethnicity distribution, and commuting trips
among them— the strong correlation between dynamic
segregation and incidence gap allows to conclude that
when it comes to predicting the exposure of a group to a
non-airborne virus, knowing the places where the members of that group commute for work is more important
and more relevant than knowing where they actually live.

7
This is also confirmed by the quite poor association of
incidence gap with other classical measures of racial segregation (see Supplementary Figures 28-29).
The results presented in this work suggest that policy
makers should definitely take into account mobility patterns when modelling the spread of a disease in a urban
area, and in predicting the impact of specific countermeasures. In particular, a strategy to mitigate incidence
gap should focus on reducing as much as possible longdistance trips for people that are naturally more exposed
to face-to-face contacts, e.g., due to their occupation, and
enforcing stricter measures of social distancing on local
activities.

where ωji is the number of daily commuting trips from
node j to node i. By doing so we aim to capture the fact
that a commuter to cell i will potentially have face-to-face
interactions with both residents in that area and other
workers commuting to that area every day. Moreover,
since the commuting network C accounts for both workhome and home-work trips, the adjusted population on
the commuting network accounts for the potential contacts that individuals had at the origin of a trip as well.

Class Mean First Passage Time (CMFPT)
METHODS
Geographic network data sets

Ethnicity data was obtained from [34] and includes
the data from the 2010 decennial census. Commuting
trips data comes from the 2011 US census [35], focusing on the seven highest-level ethnicity classes, namely:
White, Black or African American, American Indian and
Alaska Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific
Islander, Some Other Race, Two or More Races. Population is updated to the latest American Community
Survey 2014-2018 5-yeas Data Release [47].
For each metropolitan area we constructed two distinct
spatial networks. The first one is the adjacency network,
denoted by A and obtained by associating each cell to
a node and connecting two nodes with a link if the corresponding cells border each other. Notice that A is an
undirected and unweighted graph,. The second graph is
the commuting network, denoted as C. In this network
each node is a tract and the directed and weighted link
ωij between node i and j indicates the number of commuting trips from i to j as obtained from census information. To reconstruct a mobility network that resembles
the real one (which amounts to something between 30%
and 40% of the total mobility in a city) we aggregated
both the trips from home to work and the corresponding
return trip from work to home.
Each node of the adjacency network A preserves information about the ethnicity distribution on the corresponding census tract. We use the N × Γ matrix
M = {mi,α }, where Γ is the number of ethnicities present
in the city. The generic element mi,α of M indicates the
number of citizens of ethnicity α living on node i. We
denote by Mi = {mi,α } the vector of population disPN
tribution at node i, and by M α = i=1 mi,α the total
number of individuals of class α present in the system. In
the commuting network C, instead, we attribute to each
node i both the resident population at the corresponding tract and the population commuting to node i, so
that the abundance of individuals of class α on node i

Let us consider a generic graph G(V, E) with |V| = K
edges on |V| = N nodes, and a colouring function f :
V → χ that associates to each node i of G a discrete
label f (i) from the finite set χ with cardinality |χ| = Γ.
Let us also consider a random walk on G, defined by the
transition matrix Π = {πij } where πji is the probability
that the walk jumps from node i to node j in one step.
On the adjacency network A we use a uniform random
walk, i.e., πji = k1i , while on the commuting graph C we
P
ω
have πji = siji , where si = j ωij is the out-strength of
node i.
Here we focus on the statistical properties of the trajectories Wi = {f (i0 ), f (i1 ), . . .} of node labels visited
by the random walk W at each time when starting from
i0 = i at time t = 0. This dynamics contains information
about the existence of correlation and heterogeneity in
the distribution of colours. For instance, if the graph G
is a regular lattice and the function f associates colours
to nodes uniformly at random, we expect that, for longenough time, all the trajectories starting from each of the
N nodes will be statistically indistinguishable.
We denote as Ti,α the Mean First Passage Time from
a given node i to nodes of class α, i.e., the expected
number of steps needed to a walk starting on i to visit
for the first time any node j such that f (j) = α. We can
write a self-consistent forward equation for Ti,α [48]:
Ti,α = 1 +

N
X


1 − δf (j),α πji Tj,α

(2)

j=1

The Mean First Passage Time τβα from class α to class
β is defined as:
ταβ =

N
1 X
Tj,β δf (j),α ,
Nα j=1

(3)

where Nα is the number of nodes in the graph associated to class α. Notice that in practice the value of ταβ
is obtained as an average over many realisations of the
random walk.

8
A notable issue of the MFPT defined in Eq. (3) is the
fact that its values might depend on the specific distribution of colours (i.e., on their abundance) and on the size
of the network under consideration, which makes it difficult to compare Mean First Passage Times computed on
different systems. To obviate to this problem, we define
the normalised Class Mean First Passage Time between
class α and class β as:
τeαβ =

ταβ
null
ταβ

(4)

null
where ταβ
is the MFPT from class α to class β obtained
in a null-model graph. The null-model considered here is
the graph having the same topology of the original one,
and where node colours have been reassigned uniformly
at random, i.e., reshuffled by keeping their relative abundance. Notice that τeαβ is a pure number: if τeαβ > 1
(resp., τeαβ < 1 it means that the expected time to hit
a node of class β when starting from a node of class α
is higher (resp., lower) than in the corresponding nullmodel. In general, a value different from 1 indicates the
presence of correlations and heterogeneity.

Class Coverage Time (CCT)

The coverage time is classically defined as the number of steps needed to a random walk to visit a certain percentage of the nodes of a graph when starting
from a given node i [48]. In the case of a network with
coloured nodes, a walk started at node i will be associated to the generic trajectory Wi = {fi0 , fi1 , fi2 , . . .}
of node labels visited by the walk at each time. Since
we are interested in quantifying the heterogeneity of ethnicity distributions, we consider the time series Wi =
{Mi , Mi1 , Mi2 , . . .} where Mit = {mit ,α } is the distribution of ethnicities at node it visited by the walk at time
t. If we consider
the trajectory up to time t, the vector
P
Qit = H1t τ Miτ is the distribution of ethnicities visited up to time t by the walker started atPi (here Ht is a
normalisation constant that guarantees j {Qit }j = 1).
We quantify the discrepancy between Qit and the global
ethnicity distribution across the city P = H10 M| 1N by
means of the Jensen-Shannon divergence:
J(PkQit ) =

1
[D(Pkµ) + D(Qit kµ)] ,
2

(5)

where µ = 12 (P + Qit ) and D(P kQ) is the KullbackLiebler divergence between P and Q. We define the Class
Coverage Time from node i at threshold ε as:
γ i = argmin {J(P||Qit ) ≤ ε}

where γ i,null is the Class Coverage Time from node i in
a null-model where the colours associated to the nodes
have been reshuffled uniformly at random.
CMFPT and CCT in census networks

In the case of ethnicity distributions in geographical networks, each node is not uniquely associated to a
colour, but it has instead a local distribution of ethnicities. Nevertheless, the formalism for the computation
of Class Mean First Passage Times and Class Coverage
Time described above can still be used in this case as well.
We consider a stochastic colouring function fe : V → C
that associates to each node i of the adjacency graph
m
one of the Γ = 7 ethnicities α with probability P i,α
mi,β
β

(respectively, with probability

(`)

where ταβ is the CMFPT computed on the `-th reali
(`)
null
sation and ταβ
is the corresponding value in the
null
null-model. For each system we computed ταβ
on 500 realisations of the null model, with 500 independent colour
assignments per realisations, and 2000 walks per node.
The computation of CCT works in a similar way. In
order to take into account the heterogeneous distribution of ethnicities across nodes, before a walker starts
from node i we sample one of the ethnicities present on
i, according to their local abundance at i {mi,β }, and
we attribute node i to it. Then, we compute the CCT
from node i of class α as the average CCT from node
i across all the walks starting from i where node i was
actually assigned to class α, and we call this quantity
γαi . Notice that in this case we consider the trajectories
Wiα = {Miα , Miα1 , Miα2 , . . .} where Miα` is the distribution
of ethnicities at the `-th node visited by the walker, which
does not include class α. The normalised Class Coverage
Time from class α when starting from node i is defined
as:

(6)
γ
eαi =

and the associated normalised Class Coverage Time:
γi
γ i,null

in the commuting

graph), i.e., proportionally to the abundance of ethnicity
α in node i.
To compute the CMFPT we consider S independent
realisations of the stochastic colouring process for each
network. On each realisation `, we estimate the MFPT
among all classes as in Eq. (3), and the corresponding
null-model MFPT. Then, we compute the average Class
Mean First Passage Time from class α to class β as:

For all the computations of CCT shown in the paper we
considered averages over 5000 walks per node and we
set ε = 0.0018. This value was obtained by using the
Pinsker’s inequality for the Kullback-Leibler divergence
and imposing a total variation distance smaller than 6%.

We constructed three global indices of dynamic segregation based on the values of CMFPT and CCT. In
particular, we focused on the observed discrepancies of
CMFPT and CCT between African Americans and other
ethnicities. In the following the index A will always indicate African Americans, while the index O will indicate
all the other ethnicities. We start by defining the following quantities:

τ AO =

M he
τAα i

P

Mα

α6=A

M α he
ταA i

P

Mα

α6=A

P
τ OO =

α,β6=A

In practice: τ AA is the expected CMFPT from African
Americans to African Americans; τ AO is the expected
CMFPT from African Americans to all the other classes
(weighted by ethnicity distribution); τ OA is the expected
CMFPT from all the other classes to African Americans
(again, weighted by ethnicity distribution); and τ OO is
the expected CMFPT among all the other ethnicities.
Notice that all these quantities are pure numbers, since
they are based on the corresponding quantities defined
in Eq. (8) which are correctly normalised with respect to
the null-model.
The clustering of African Americans is quantified as:
τ AO
τ OO

(11)

so that values of C larger than 1 indicate that for an
African American finding any other ethnicity is harder
(i.e., requires more time) than for all other ethnicities.
Similarly, we define the exposure of African Americans
to other ethnicities as:
E=

over all the nodes. Notice that values of I larger than 1
indicate that the normalised CCT from nodes of class A
(African American) is higher than the CCT from nodes of
all the other classes. The State-level value of each index
is obtained as an average of the corresponding index on
the cities of the state, weighted by the population of each
city.

We define two local segregation indices for African
Americans in a census tract i. The first index is based
on CMFPT:

where Tei,α corresponds to the normalised Mean First Passage Time to a generic class α when a random walker
starts from node i, while Tei,A is the CMFPT to African
Americans tracts. Values of ξei larger than 1 indicate that
the time to reach any other ethnicity is higher than the
time needed to reach African Americans, hence indicating a local clustering of African Americans around node
i.
The local index of isolation is derived from CCT:

(16)

i
where γ
eA
is the CCT from node i for African Americans

and γ
eO is the average CCT from node i for all the other
ethnicities, as defined in Eq. (13). In general, if ψei is
larger than 1 then African Americans living at node i
are isolated, since they will require more time to visit all
the other classes than required by individuals from other
ethnicities.

Data on COVID-19 incidence among the African
American Population

The data related to the percentage of infected African
Americans was obtained from two different sources [32]

10
and [33]. The first data set reports the number of infected
and deceased of each ethnicity along with those unknown.
To calculate the percentage of African Americans we have
removed first the unknown from the total, otherwise our
analysis would also capture the fraction of unknown. For
the other data set we just extract the data they provide
in tables.

Multivariate Analysis

The multivariate analysis was performed using R and
the ANOVA model in the car package.

Appendix A: Quantifying ethnic segregation through CMFPT and CCT
Ethnic segregation and COVID-19 incidence through CMFPT

Ethnic segregation is quantified here through random walks, and more precisely, class mean first passage times
(CMFPT). Given a set of classes present in a city – ethnicities in this case– we are interested in the number of
steps you need to reach one as a function of the ethnicity at the origin. Random walks start from each of the city
cells –or tracts– and move until they have visited each of the distinct classes or ethnicities present in a city. If we
average the passage times across all the city cells and then divide by the same quantity from the null model we
obtain the normalised CMFPT between class α and β τeαβ . It is important to note that this matrix is not necessarily
symmetric and depends on the spatial distribution of classes. We show in Supplementary Figure S-1 the CMFPT on
the adjacency graph for four cities: Detroit, Chicago, Houston and Los Angeles. On a first look, strong differences
can be detected between those cities on the left and those on the right. The normalised CMFPT are substantially
higher in Detroit and Chicago when compared to Houston and Los Angeles. Despite the difference in the maximum
values, the shape of the matrix and curves is not so different across cities, with African Americans much more isolated
than the rest of ethnicities. Reaching African Americans is much harder for any other class, while it is considerably
low for other African Americans. As can be seen, there are not only strong differences between both cities but also
between the type of network used (See Supplementary Figure S-2). One significant change that appears in some
cities when τeαβ is computed over the adjacency graph is that for African Americans, Whites are more easy to reach
than themselves, which means that mobility plays a crucial role on approaching African Americans to the rest of the
population and exposing them. Additionally, the normalised CMFPT seems to be less dependent on the ethnicity of
the origin and more on the ethnicity of the destination. Likely as a consequence of the higher mixing produced by
the long-range links present in the mobility network. Not only that, but the differences between each ethnicity are
also reduced. Overall, to properly quantify segregation we need to take into account not only the residences but also
how the ethnicities move in cities.

Ethnic segregation and COVID-19 incidence through CCT

We consider a number of Consolidated Statistical Areas (CSA) in the US, 128 networks are constructed based on
adjacency while 171 networks were constructed for commuting. These systems are represented as a spatial graph G

FIG. S-2. Normalised inter-class mean first passage times among the different ethnicities contained in our data set when walkers
move on the commuting network in two different visualisation styles for the following cities: Chicago, Detroit, Houston and
Los Angeles.

and we look at the statistical properties of the trajectories of a random walk on G. Each walk starting at node i
is associated to an ethnicity sampled from Qit and it stops at time t when J(P||Qit ) ≤ ε. When the ethnicity α
is sampled, the corresponding bin is removed from the computation J(P||Qit ) so that the effect that α has on the
coverage time at threshold  can be quantified.
Trajectories from each node are averaged over 5000 repetitions for the adjacency network and 2000 for commuting.
The null model for CCT is obtained by randomly reassigning the vector Mi to a new node in G and the concentration
of an ethnicity in a region - if such spatial pattern is present - is dissolved across G. Here we consider 20 independent
repetitions of the null model for each CSA on both adjacency and commuting networks, then, the Class Coverage
Time (CCT ) for the null model of a city is the average behaviour over 20 independent realisations.
The normalised CCT is reported for the two spatial configurations in Fig. S-3 a-b. The coverage times obtained
for the adjacency networks a are considerably larger compared to commuting b, where on the later, the majority of
values spams in a small range between 0 and 4. The distributions of γ
eα for each ethnicity have a comparable shape
within the network type where most values are contained in a common interval, yet, they are distinguishable and

at a CSA.

differences between the ethnicities can be observed. The corresponding non-normalised quantities can be read on
panels c-d where the CCT of the real system and the equivalent null model are reported.
It is important to note that the difference on the CCT of the real system and the null model is significantly large
on the adjacency networks, with the former having cases where coverage times are two orders of magnitude larger
(See Fig. S-3 c). Although the null model corresponds to the non-segregated counterpart of the city and coverage
times are expected to be smaller, these large differences suggest caution and open an interesting question for further
investigation. In particular, to understand what factors influence the large differences, for instance if it is mainly
driven by the population distribution, the threshold , the network topology or the combination of two or more
factors.
In addition to the cities discussed in the main manuscript, we report two other systems in Fig. S-4 where individual
values of γ
eα for each ethnicity can be observed on the adjacency and commute networks. African Americans are
substantially less isolated in Houston compared to the other ethnicities in both adjacency and commute networks.
In Detroit, The adjacency information gives the opposite picture for African Americas while Whites are the most
isolated on the commute network.

TABLE S-I. Table of cities studied

Appendix B: Correlations between the incidence of COVID-19 among the African American population cases
and ethnic segregation)
Rankings and comparisons

We detail the cities studied in Supplementary Table S-I, it is important to note that those are the cities studied
disregarding if those states provide ethnic information on the impact of COVID-19.
Supplementary Figure S-5 displays the ranking of values for each of the four metrics studied in the main manuscript
computed over the adjacency or commuting graphs. As can be seen, strong similarities between rankings appear.
To evaluate how similar are those rankings we have calculated the Kendall τk between each pair of rankings.
Supplementary Figure S-6 displays the values of τk between each pair of the four metrics studied in the main manuscript
computed in the adjacency and commuting graphs. For instance, there is a high correlation between the index C
computed in the adjacency and the commuting graphs while for the exposure index E there is almost no correlation

between both. Likely pointing out that exposure can only be effectively measured by including the commuting network.
Another additional observation is the connection between C and E measured on the commuting graph, which seems
to point out that in those states where African Americans are more segregated they are also more exposed.

In Supplementary Figure S-7, we compare the indices studied in this work, showing that most of them are related
to each other yet not necessarily linearly. We find that those indices capturing the clustering of African Americans
are also related to those related to mixing and exposure. The more clustered together, more sensible and exposed to
the rest of the population. When comparing the same indices in the commuting and adjacency graphs, we observe
that they have a non-linear relation, highlight again the importance of considering both of them.

Correlations between the segregation indices and other measures of COVID-19 incidence

The COVID-19 data used was obtained from [32] and includes several temporal snapshots until mid-may. The main
variables we used are the difference on infected/deceased African Americans, where 0 would mean that the percentage
of African Americans in the population of a state is the same than the percentage of infected, and the ratio calculated
as the percentage of infected African Americans divided by their percentage among the overall population, which will
be one if they are equal and higher than one if there are more African Americans infected/deceased among the overall
population. Supplementary Table S-II summarises the results obtained for the linear fit for the Figure 2 in the main
manuscript.
Supplementary Figure S-8 summarises the results obtained in the case of the ratio of infected African Americans.
As detailed in the main manuscript, there are two versions of each index depending on whether the walkers move
upon the adjacency or the commuting network. Compared to the difference in percentage correlations are much lower
for the ratio, likely as a consequence of the several outliers. While states with a low percentage of African Americans
among the overall population might easily suffer a huge increase on the ratio, those with a higher percentage of African
Americans among the population might have a lower increase.
We have also evaluated how our metrics relate to the ratio and difference among the deceased African Americans
(See Supplementary Figures S-9 and S-10 ). Despite many more factors such as the age or underlying health conditions
might influence the deceased individuals, still, most of the correlations remain significant to some extent, especially
those related to their exposure. Moreover, those indices computed on the commuting network seem to be more
informative than those based on the adjacency, which seems to point out that residential segregation provides only a
partial picture of ethnic inequality. Mobility is also crucial to understand the mixing between different ethnicities, it
is not only relevant where certain ethnicities live but also where they work and with whom they interact when they
do so.
Overall, despite our metrics are informative in both cases, they seem to be more related to the difference in
percentage more than the ratio. There are states in which the percentage of African Americans among the population
is low and, therefore, the ratio can increase drastically.
Ideally, each ethnicity α should be compared with the corresponding ratio to the overall population and the incidence

of COVID-19 cases. As this data was not available during the preparation of this work, we look at the gap ∆Ainf

Correlations with the infection rate gap ∆Ainf on the adjacency and commute network are reported on Fig. S-11
and S-12 for all ethnicities. Quantities are obtained from the COVID-19 data set at 2 different periods, 12-04-2020
and 19-04-2020 respectively. The corresponding R2 of the Pearson correlation is reported in the inset of each panel.
There is a negative correlation in b which indicates that less isolated African Americans have a higher incidence of
infection cases. Whites a and Native Hawaiians e exhibit no correlation while the remaining ethnicities c-d and f-g
have a positive R2 which decreases over time. We found no correlation for any ethnicity on the commuting network.

Similarly, correlations with ∆Adeceased are computed for the deceased data on the adjacency and commute networks
(See Fig. S-13 and S-14). We can observe a similar pattern with the results obtained from infected rates where there
is correlations for the same group of ethnicities and no significant relationship on the commuting network.

Appendix C: Local segregation maps through CMFPT and CCT and spatial correlation

In the main manuscript, we show the values for the local segregation indices ξ andψ for Chicago and Los Angeles
showing that there were significant differences on their spatial distribution as well as in their maximum values. Here
we provide also results for Detroit and Houston to show that again there are significant differences. In this case,
Detroit is the most populated city in Michigan, which is one of the states with highest values in most of the indices
considered and Houston is the most populated city in Texas, which is a state with consistent low values in most
segregation indices. Regarding the impact of COVID-19 among the African Americans of those states, in Michigan
the gap is around 34% in early April and 24% in mid-may. In Texas, instead, the gap is around 2% at the beginning
of April and 5% in mid-May.
In the main manuscript and Supplementary Figure S-15 we plot the local measures of segregation in each of the
census tracts of Chicago, Los Angeles, Detroit and Houston. Those maps display certain common patterns that we
quantify in Supplementary Figure S-16. Therein we have calculated the Kendall τk correlation coefficient performing

pairwise comparisons of the values for each tract unit. Additionally to the segregation indices, we also compared the
values for the ratio of African American population. It is relevant to note that while the value of τk for the ratio
of African American population and ξe computed in the adjacency graph is around 0.8 for all the four cities studied,
there are stronger variations when ξe is computed in the commuting graph – i.e., 0.81 in Detroit and 0.55 in Houston –
meaning that the effect of commuting in the segregation of African American population can display strong differences
across cities and, therefore, mobility offers a different picture of urban segregation.

Appendix D: Temporal analysis of correlations with segregation indices and other socioeconomic indicators
Statistical analysis of the COVID-19 incidence data

In this section, we provide the temporal evolution of correlations between the difference in the percentage of COVID19 incidence among African Americans and other segregation indices. First of all, Supplementary Figure S-17 shows
the number of states included in each of the temporal snapshots. As can be seen, it increases with time yet already in
the first temporal snapshots there are almost 20 of them. It is important to note that by mid-April, the US reached
the first peak of the pandemic.
Additionally to the number of states included in the analysis we also observe significant changes in the values
across time for the different states analysed. We provide in Supplementary Figures S-18 and S-19 the evolution of the
difference in percentage of infected and deceased African Americans. States are split in quartiles of the distribution
of the percentage of African Americans among the overall population. While the average seems almost stable in most
of the quartiles this is more a product of compensating changes than of stability in the values for a single state. For
instance, in the first quartile there is a sharp increase in Minnesota compensated by a decrease in DC. On the third
quartile, the sharp decrease in Illinois is compensated by the increase in Arkansas. It is also important to note that
some states display strong discrepancies between the percentage on deceased and infected as, for instance, Minnesota.

Correlations with the ratio of infected African Americans and the difference in percentage and the ratio of
deceased African Americans

In the main manuscript, the main variable analysed is the difference in the percentage of African Americans since
other factors might influence the deceased and the ratio that can lead to several outliers. In Supplementary Figures

FIG. S-16. Correlations between the each of the local metrics of segregation ξe and ψe and the local ratio
of African American population. Correlation between each of the local indices of segregation and the ratio of African
American population by census tract as well. On the top row Chicago and Los Angeles and on the bottom row Detroit and
Houston.

S-20, S-21 and S-22, we show respectively the correlation with the difference in percentage of deceased African
Americans, the ratio of infected and the ratio of deceased. In the case of the difference in percentage we can see
that despite correlations are lower they are stable across time. It is important to note that in the case of deceased
individuals other factors like the age or the underlying health conditions might play a significant role. In the case of
both ratios, correlations are slightly high in the first snapshots suffer a steeper decrease. Again C and E computed
in the commuting graph seem to outperform the rest of metrics.

Temporal evolution of correlations with another data set

We also had access to another project that aggregates data on the ethnicity of both infected and deceased African
Americans by COVID-19 through three different temporal snapshots 22/04/2020, 04/05/2020 and 15/05/2020 [33]. In
Supplementary Figure S-23, we report the correlations in each of the three snapshots for the difference in the percentage
of infected African Americans, which are in line with the results obtained for the other data set. Correlations are
considerably high and significant for the first stages of the pandemic and decrease with time as the different lock-downs
take place. As in the results provided in the main manuscript, those indices computed on the commuting graph seem
to provide a better correlation than those computed on the adjacency one. Again those indices connected to the
exposure of African Americans only yield significant correlation on the commuting network. The results obtained for

Formulation of the alternative indices C 0 and E 0

In the main manuscript we have studied the metrics C and E which are computed from the elements of the
normalised CMFPT τeα,β . However, there are more potential ways to capture the clustering and exposure of an
ethnicity by doing the other calculations from that matrix. Here we propose the two alternative formulations for
those two metrics
τ OA
τ OO
τ AA
0
E =
τ AO

C0 =

The first quantity comes from the ratio between the time from other ethnicities to African Americans and the time
from other ethnicities to others, where higher values correspond more isolated African Americans compared to other
ethnicities. The second quantity instead, is the ratio between the time separating African Americans and the time
between African Americans and any other ethnicity, where higher values correspond to African Americans more
exposed to others than to themselves. The correlation between our alternative proposals and the difference in the
percentage of African Americans infected is shown in Supplementary Figure S-27. While correlations are slightly
lower, they are still significant. One interesting finding is that E 0 changes the sign of the correlation when computed
over the adjacency graph and the commuting network. Highlighting once again the need of considering mobility to
understand the segregation and exposure of ethnicities in urbanscapes.

Temporal evolution of correlations with other segregation indices from the literature

We have also studied the correlations between the difference in the percentage of COVID-19 incidence among
African Americans and other segregation indices from the literature. First of all, we obtained the segregation index
σα proposed in [42], which is also based on the movement of random walks is spatial systems and captures the
probability that a randomly chosen individual of group α meets another individual of the same group, or in this case,
ethnicity. Additionally, we also computed Moran’s I, which is a measure of spatial auto-correlation and compares the
ethnic composition of neighbourhoods [26]. The correlation of both metrics with the difference in the percentage of
infected among African Americans. The evolution of the correlations is shown in Supplementary Figure S-28, where
only the Moran index calculated over the adjacency graph seems to display a significant correlation.
For the second metric we have build a matrix of distance between ethnicities similar to the one obtained for τeα,β
using a measure proposed by [41]. Inspired by the Getis and Ord statistic [49], the metric proposed [41] quantifies for
each location i the exposure of ethnicity α to ethnicity β as
Pn
β ∗
α Gi

wij (dˆpi )mj,β
Pn
,
j=1 mj,β

j=1

=

(S-1)

where each n is the total number of location in a city, j corresponds to each of those locations and mj,β is the
population of ethnicity β in location j, dˆpi is an estimate of trip length and wij (dˆpi ) is a function of the distance that
is equal to 1 when dij < dpj and 0 otherwise. In the case of the adjacency graph only adjacent pair of tracts were
considered whereas in the case of the commuting network only pairs connected by commuting trips were considered.
Overall βα G∗i quantify the ratio of population of ethnicity β to which the individuals residing in i are exposed. In our
case we set the threshold dpj equal to the average commuting distance in each of the cities. Succinctly, βα G∗i is a value
between 0 and 1 that encapsulates the fraction of the population of ethnicity. We average the value of βα G∗i to obtain
a distance matrix between ethnicities in each of the cities as

β ∗
α Gi

=

n
X
i=1

mi,α βα G∗i

n
X

mi,α ,

(S-2)

i=1

so that we take into account the fraction of population of ethnicity α in location i. Finally from the matrix βα < G∗ >
we compute the same exposure and clustering indices computed from τeα,β in the main text. Calculating first

Additionally to the calculation of the indices in the adjacency and the commuting network with dynamical population we also computed it with the residential population and the commuting network to investigate the role played
by the dynamical population. As can be seen in Supplementary Figure S-29, significant correlations appear with all
indices yet the higher ones are with the exposure index especially when computed on the commuting network with
dynamical population. Correlations are, however, lower and less stable than those obtained in the main manuscript.
Overall, it is important to note that none of the additional segregation metrics we have studied in this section is
more informative than the ones we proposed on the main manuscript based on CMFPT and CCT. Moreover, the use

The relation between the incidence of COVID-19 in African Americans and socio-economic indicators

We present in this section the correlations between a set of socio-economic indicators and the incidence of COVID19 in African Americans. For the sake of brevity, we focus here only on the data set used in the main manuscript
as well as in the difference in the percentage of infections which is the case where correlations are higher. The
set of indicators we have studied are the median household income, the percentage of the population below the
poverty level, the percentage of insured and uninsured African Americans, the usage of public transportation by both
African Americans and the overall population, the percentage of African American population in a state, the average
commuting distance and the ratio between the average commuting distance of African Americans and the overall
population. All of the metrics are provided at the level of the African American population and the results are shown
in Supplementary Figure S-30. The median household income, the percentage of the population below the poverty
level, the percentage of insured and uninsured African Americans were obtained from the 2018 American Community
Survey elaborated by the U.S. Census Bureau [34]. Most of the variables yield low or very low correlations except for
the usage of public transportation by African Americans. Economic indicators such as median income or percentage
of poverty seem to slightly correlate with the incidence of COVID-19, which could because because a more deprived
African American community puts them in a more risky situation. Regarding the health indicators related to the
degree of insurance of African Americans, it seems there is no direct relation with the number of infected. Not so
surprising results since we are analysing the percentage of infected and, therefore, the fact of having insurance might
not change significantly the risk of getting the illness. Finally, the usage of public transportation seems to play a
crucial role in the spread of the disease, especially if we compare the use done by the African American population and
the overall population where no correlation appears. The fact that African Americans use more public transportation
might put them on a more dangerous position as well as might a reflection of their economic status. Moreover, it
could happen that in those cities in which African Americans are more segregated they also have to use more the
public transportation.
Additionally to those socio-economic variables we also tested if the overall African American population can also be
used as a proxy for the difference in percentage. We also computed on our commuting networks the average commuting
distance of the African American population as well as the ratio with the commuting distance of the overall population.
As displayed in Supplementary Figure S-31, the overall percentage of African American population seems to be related
to the difference in the percentage of infected. However, there is a striking difference between the Pearson and the
Spearman correlation coefficients, which means that the rank is more or less conserved yet there are strong outliers.
In other words, a state with more percentage of African American population will more easily have a higher difference
on the infected yet the population does not align the points in a straight trend. Regarding the mobility indicators,
none of them yields a significant correlation, meaning that it is not so relevant how far African Americans travel and
where they travel and whom they meet.
