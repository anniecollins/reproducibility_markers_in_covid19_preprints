Abstract An analysis of the COVID-19 epidemic is proposed on the basis of the
epiMOX dashboard (publicly accessible at https://www.epimox.polimi.it) that
deals with data of the epidemic trends and outbreaks in Italy from late February 2020.
Our analysis provides an immediate appreciation of the past epidemic development,
together with its current trends by fostering a deeper interpretation of available data
through several critical epidemic indicators. In addition, we complement the epiMOX
dashboard with a predictive tool based on an epidemiological compartmental model,
named SUIHTER, for the forecast on the near future epidemic evolution.

1 Introduction
For the COVID-19 pandemic, the development of reliable mathematical models,
supported by the availability and analysis of complete and accurate data, is a fundamental tool for the interpretation and understanding of the epidemic, as well as
for providing support to digital health [18]. The availability of accurate and comNicola Parolini

plete historical data together with a suitable epidemiological model for short-term
forecasting are essential to provide institutional bodies and authorities with factual
quantitative information prior to the adoption of non-pharmaceutical interventions
(NPIs).
The first goal of this paper is to present a newly developed mathematical dashboard
named epiMOX (accessible online at the address https://www.epimox.polimi.it ),
which gathers the time histories of recorded epidemiological compartments and
their first and second rates of variation. We believe that this analysis, which focuses
on the situation in Italy at both national and regional scales – for all the 20 Italian
regions – will enhance the interpretation and transparency of available data thanks to
a thorough understanding of the past epidemic development, and of its current trends.
As several other countries, Italy has been hit since February 2020 by a sequence of
epidemic waves: the first one initiated on February 21, 2020 and exhausted in early
June 2020, while the second wave raised in early October 2020 and peaked in late
November 2020, while the outbreak of a third wave is being observed at the time of
writing (March 7, 2021).
The second goal of the paper is to enable a comparison between the first and
the second epidemic waves in Italy that feature indeed several analogies, as well as
significant differences that we aim to highlight and analyze.
Finally, a preview on the expected trend of the epidemic for the near future –
late March 2021 – is discussed, based on a compartmental epidemiological model,
named SUIHTER, which was purposely designed for the Italian COVID-19 epidemic
[16].
Our analysis highlights several important features of the Italian COVID-19 epidemic. The most relevant are the following:
(i) In the early phase of the exponential outbreak, the timeline for the implementation of NPIs is crucial. It is indeed far more efficient to take more stringent
restrictions for a short time span in the early phase of the outbreak rather than
implementing less severe (or even the same) restrictions for a longer interval
later.
(ii) The second epidemic wave showed a slower pace, but a widespread diffusion
in the Country that eventually yielded far worse figures (in terms of fatalities,
patients hosted in intensive care units, etc.) than the first wave.
(iii) The epidemiological mathematical model SUIHTER allows the investigation
of various scenarios that conform to the different restrictive NPIs devised by
the Italian government. We identify those that are potentially more effective to
contrast the near future epidemic development.
(iv) A retrospective (a posteriori) analysis allows the validation of the SUIHTER.
epidemiological model on different phases of the epidemic.
(v) Thanks to the SUIHTER model we can carry out a what-if analysis aimed at
simulating different epidemic trends that would have occurred in case different
NPIs had been implemented by the Italian authorities at the outbreak of the
second wave.

In this paper, epidemiological data available up to March 7, 2021 are used to
validate the suitability of the epiMOX dashboard to provide fast and in-depth analyses of the past trends of the Italian outbreak and predict its evolution through the
SUIHTER epidemiological model. Needless to say, the epiMOX dashboard will continue to monitor the evolution of the epidemic providing updated predictions based
on data made available on a daily basis.
An outline of this paper is as follows: in Section 2 a description of the COVID-19
epidemic data time series is supplied together with a description of the data processing tools (filtering, derivative, scaling, normalization) used to straightforwardly
identify the main characteristics of each time series. The first and second epidemic
waves are analysed and the results are compared at both the national (Section 2.1)
and regional (Section 2.2) scales. Some critical indicators for the epidemic, that can
be displayed by the dashboard, are analyzed in Section 3. In Section 4 we first recall
the SUIHTER model and analyze its interplay with the epiMOX dashboard. In particular, through the dashboard, we validate the model in Section 4.1 against the data
of the second wave at the national level. Then, we propose what-if-scenarios for the
analysis of alternative NPIs in Section 4.2, we analyze the impact of the UK variant
in Section 4.3, and we compare different short term future scenarios in Section 4.4.
Conclusions follow in Section 5.

2 Data acquisition, processing, and analysis
The data used in this paper are those made available by the Italian Dipartimento
della Protezione Civile (DPC) through the open data repository https://github.
com/pcm-dpc/COVID-19. Data are communicated on a daily basis and include
the number of individuals who are currently positive, isolated at home, hospitalized,
hosted in ICUs (Intensive Care Units), the daily positive cases, the cumulative number
of deaths and recovered since the beginning of the pandemic, and the number of
swabs performed. All these data are supplied at both the regional and national levels,
while the available data on a finer scale (provinces) are unfortunately limited to the
count of positive cases since the beginning of the epidemic.
From now on we will refer to these data as raw data. These raw data can then be
smoothed by resorting to a local polynomial regression based on the Savitzky–Golay
convolution filter [19]: at day 𝑛 we attribute the value of the polynomial of degree
𝑟 that approximates, in the least squares sense, the 2𝑞 + 1 values of the raw data
centered on day n, i.e. in the range [𝑛 − 𝑞, 𝑛 + 𝑞], where 𝑟 ≤ 2𝑞. Here, we consider
a cubic least squares polynomial and a window size of 21 days (that is, 𝑟 = 3 and
𝑞 = 10). A standard approach based on a weekly moving average could be obtained
by taking 𝑟 = 0 and 𝑞 = 3.
From now on, if not otherwise specified, the time series that will be presented will
be smooth curves obtained using the Savitzky–Golay convolution filter described
above.

The second step is to calculate the first and second rates of variation of the
different compartments. First rate of variation describes how fast a trend is either
increasing or decreasing: change of sign from positive to negative for the first rate
of variation indicates switching from increasing to decreasing in the corresponding
curves, whereas a change of sign on the second rate of variations denotes a change
of convexity (a point of inflection).

2.1 The epidemic at the national scale
The time series of the filtered data (solid lines) for some relevant epidemiological
compartments at the national Italian level, namely the daily positive cases, the daily
deceased, the number of individuals that are hospitalized with symptoms and those
hosted in ICUs, are reported in Figure 1. On top of each figure, we display a color
bar. The color code used therein is corresponding to the severity of NPIs, as stated
in DPCM (the decree issued by the Italian Government) on November 4, 20201.
The color codes apply at regional level and are defined as follows, according to
an algorithm based on different risk indicators:
• yellow: moderate risk zones with basic NPIs in place (mandatory use of masks,
curfew from 10PM to 5AM, limitations on the activity of shops, bars and restaurants, strong limitations of sport and leisure activities, (partial) distance learning
for secondary schools);
• orange: elevate risk zones with stricter NPIs (municipality confinement, food
service activities suspended);
• red: maximum risk zones with the even stricter NPIs (home confinement, distance
learning from grade 8, non-essential commercial activities suspended, all sport
and leisure activities suspended).
Since November 6, 2020 the color of each region has been updated weekly. At the
national level (e.g. in Figure 1), the color code is obtained as a suitable averaging
of those in place in the regions, weighted by their population. The strict lockdown
imposed at the national level in Spring 2020 is conventionally identified with the
black color.
By analysing the time series of the positive cases using a log scale (see Figure 2)
along with the full evolution of the epidemic in Italy, we can observe, for the first
epidemic wave, an exponential growth 𝑓 (𝑡) = 𝐶𝑒 𝜆1 𝑡 (which is linear in log scale with
slope 𝜆1 ) for the first two weeks of March with a doubling time of approximately 3
days.
During the second half of August, very likely because of the relaxation of social
distances during the summer holidays and the newly imported cases from abroad, a
few days of exponential growth can be observed, although featuring a much lower
growth factor 𝜆2 , yielding a doubling time of approximately 15 days. Finally, what we
will refer to as the second wave had its exponential growth last October, with a growth

factor 𝜆3 and a doubling time of about 8 days. This was very likely connected to
the increased number of contacts associated with the school opening in September
and related commuting, the restart of recreational activities in closed ambiences,
seasonality, and the full recovery of the working activities that were dramatically
reduced during the spring lockdown, as well as (although at a minor extent) during
the summer period. Finally, we observe an exponential growth starting by the end
of February 2021 and due to new virus variants featuring a higher transmission rate
(see the discussion in Section 4.3). Although, in this case, the growth rate 𝜆4 appears
to be lower than previous ones with a corresponding doubling time of approximately
36 days, the fact that this new outbreak is starting from a much larger number (more
than half a million) of positive individuals makes the situation at present (early
March 2021) extremely critical.

2.1.1 The first epidemic wave
We first focus on the first epidemic wave that occurred in Italy last Spring 2020. In
our dashboard, a specific time range can be selected and each time series can be
normalised with respect to its maximum attained in the prescribed time range. This
allows for an immediate identification of the day the different peaks have occurred
and of their relative positions (relative delays). As displayed in Figure 3, it can be
noticed that the first compartment that reaches a peak is that of the number of daily
positive cases (on March 24, 2020), followed 5 days later on March 29, 2020 by the
peak of daily deceased. The peaks for the number of individuals hosted in ICUs and
those hospitalized occur on April 1 and 3, respectively, that is 7 and 9 days past the
peak of daily positive cases.
Even if, at a first glance, the fact that the peak of daily deceased occurs before
those of the hospitalized and hosted in ICUs may appear surprising, this is instead
reasonable since the latter data do not refer to new daily entries but to the total number
of individuals who are hosted in hospitals or ICUs at a specific date. Unfortunately,
information (raw data) on the daily admissions in hospitals and ICUs are not available,
the latter being supplied starting only on December 3, 2020. Finally, the peak of
positive cases was reached on April 21, 2020, that is almost one month past the peak
of daily positive cases.
A similar analysis carried out on the rate of change (first derivative) of the
different indicators may be used to determine when the initial exponential phase
for each indicator is over. In Figure 4, the normalized first derivatives of the same
indicators discussed above are displayed. In particular, we notice that the growth
rate of the daily positive cases reached its maximum on March 15, 2020, while the
growth rate of the number of hosted in ICUs is attained just 4 days later (March 19,
2020). This corresponds to an inflection point in the time series and indicates the
time at which the growth rate starts decreasing.

between the different peaks during the first epidemic wave

2.1.2 The second epidemic wave
The second wave of the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy started on the first half of
October 2020. The peak of daily positive cases was reached on November 14, 2020
(see Figure 5).
Other relevant compartments reached their peaks with a time shift that is consistent
with the epidemic evolution. In particular, the maximum number of hospitalized,
hosted in ICUs and daily deceased were reached on November 23, 24 and 29,
respectively (see the normalized time series in Figure 6).
As already observed for the first wave, monitoring the growing rate (first derivative) of the time series can provide a preliminary indication on when the peaks should
be expected. For instance, as displayed in Figure 7, the peak on the growth rate of
the daily positive (on October 24, 2020) anticipates the peak of the hosted in ICUs
by 12 days (November 5, 2020).
For the second wave, a consistent time lag between the peaks of the first derivative
and the peak of the corresponding time series can be noticed. As shown in Table 1
for most of the compartments (Positives, Daily positives Hospitalized and Hosted in
ICUs) there is a 20-days delay between inflection point and the maximum, while this
delay is slightly longer (24 days) for the Daily deceased time series. A consistent
time lag between inflection point and maximum point (the one corresponding to the
peak) can be used as a preliminary indicator in future epidemic waves to predict the
day at which the peak will possibly occur.

A similar correlation between the peak of the derivative and that of the corresponding time series is missing during the first wave. This is likely due to the severe
under-estimation of data collected for some epidemiological compartments and then
provided by the DPC.

2.2 The epidemic at the regional scale
The same analyses that have been proposed at the national Italian level can be
carried out at the regional scale, that is for each of the 19 Italian Regions and the 2
autonomous provinces of Trento and Bolzano. In Figure 8, the normalized time series
of daily positive cases, hospitalized, hosted in ICUs and daily deceased are presented

for 8 Italian regions, among which Lombardia, Emilia Romagna, Piemonte, Veneto
that were severely hit by the first epidemic wave, and Lazio, Puglia, Campania, Sicilia
that are far more evidently affected by the latter epidemic wave than by the former.
In Figure 9 we display the evolution of the pandemic in the eight largest Italian
regions since the early stages of the second wave (September 2020). We compare
two compartments: positives, and hosted in ICUs, in three regions in northern Italy
(Lombardia, Veneto, Emilia-Romagna) that were severely affected by the first wave.
The same comparison is carried out in Figure 10 concerning three southern Italian
regions (Campania, Sicilia and Sardegna, the latter two being insular) that were very
mildly affected by the first wave last Spring 2020. We recall that, in all figures,
the upper color bars indicate the non-uniform NPIs. If we focus on the number of
Positives per 100,000 inhabitants (Figures 9(a) and 10(a)) that were diagnosed as
positive to the virus, we notice that the red regime yields a pronounced decrease
of the curves. Both the orange and yellow regimes serve to mitigate the outbreak,
without however significantly damp it. This behavior is less evident on the hosted
in ICUs compartment (Figures 9(b) and 10(b)). A possible explanation is that this
latter compartment is slightly more "indifferent" to the stringency of the NPIs that
are being implemented. The hosted in ICUs individuals are at a very large extent
elder people who were less directly exposed to outdoor contacts as either they were
residents of healthcare facilities or they spent a substantial part of their time at home.

3 Analysis of some critical indicators
The epiMOX dashboard can display several critical indicators for monitoring the
progress of the pandemic, namely:
• The daily evolution of R*, an estimate of the reproduction number Rt proposed
in [2].
• The daily evolution of the fatality rate, estimated through the CFR (Case Fatality
Ratio) as the ratio between the number of cumulative deaths at a given date and
the number of resolved cases at the same date

• The daily evolution of the hospitalized case ratio (HCR), defined as

• The daily evolution of the 14-day notification rate, that is the number of new
positive cases emerged in the previous 14 days per 100,000 population, an indicator used by the European Union to monitor the evolution of the epidemic in the
different European regions.
From Figures 11, 12 and 13, we can notice that CFR, PR and HCR were far much
higher in the first wave than in the second one because of a significant underestimation
of the value of the denominators. The 𝑃𝑅 indicator dramatically dropped around mid
January 2021 because of the different counting strategy for cases that was adopted
by authorities. Indeed, since then the denominator accounts for both molecular and
genetic swabs. Figure 14 displays the value of the (estimated) reproduction number
R* in three different Italian Regions. We can notice that a significant increase of
R* is reported over the summer period in two touristic regions like the Sardegna
island and the Trento province in the Dolomites due to a substantial increase of the
population and a very likely relaxation of the restrictions (limited use of facial masks
and lacking of the social distancing).

4 Empowering epiMOX with the SUIHTER epidemiological
model
Epidemic forecasting of COVID-19 is difficult because of the intrinsic variability
and uncertainty of the pandemic. Incomplete, uncertain, or inaccurate data, in terms

of both initial conditions and time series of the different compartments, represent
a serious limitation. The partial knowledge of the behavior of the specific infecting
agent and the dynamic evolution of environmental and social conditions is a further
source of uncertainty.
Since the seminal work in [13], where the first SIR compartmental model based
on a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations was presented, a large variety
of models have been proposed – see, for instance, [5, 6, 8, 9, 12, 14] – each one
attempting to cope with specific aspects of the problem. If in the original SIR model
the epidemic evolution is described by the number of individuals belonging to the
susceptible (S), infected (I) and removed (R) compartments, several models consider
increasing the number of compartments to include, for instance:
• the exposed individuals (those who have already been exposed to the infecting
agent but are not yet infectious);
• possible splitting of the infected compartment into different classes according to
the actual level of severity;
• a distinction of the removed compartment in recovered and dead.
These models, although typically derived under many simplifying assumptions,
enable forecasting analyses that go beyond mere data extrapolation. Moreover, simulations regarding the future dynamics may allow the investigation of different
scenarios corresponding to different NPIs. One of the most critical aspects in the
development of complex compartmental models is indeed related to their calibration
based on available data. On the one hand, data related to the different compartments
may not be available (or they may not even be collected); on the other hand, the
resulting data assimilation problem may suffer from limited identifiability of the
parameters, as discussed, e.g., in the paper [17] for SIR-like models of COVID-19.
A new compartmental model named SUIHTER has been recently introduced in [16]
with the goal of facing the first of these two issues, i.e. defining a model best suited
for the data actually available. In the context of the COVID-19 epidemic, the time
series that are daily collected and made available (which have already been described
discussing the dashboard for the data analysis) led us to consider for the new model
the following compartments:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

𝑆: susceptible (uninfected) individuals;
𝑈: undetected (both asymptomatic and symptomatic) infected individuals;
𝐼: isolated (quarantined) individuals;
𝐻: hospitalized individuals;
𝑇: threatened (acutely symptomatic infected, hosted in ICUs) individuals;
𝐸: extinct individuals;
𝑅: recovered individuals,
In this paper, we use the following specific version of the SUIHTER model:

𝐻¤ (𝑡) = 𝜔 𝐼 𝐼 (𝑡) − (𝜌 𝐻 + 𝜔 𝐻 )𝐻 (𝑡),

(1)

𝑇¤ (𝑡) = 𝜔 𝐻 𝐻 (𝑡) − (𝜌𝑇 + 𝛾𝑇 )𝑇 (𝑡),
𝐸¤ (𝑡) = 𝛾 𝐼 𝐼 (𝑡) + 𝛾𝑇 𝑇 (𝑡),
¤ = 𝜌𝑈 𝑈 (𝑡) + 𝜌 𝐼 𝐼 (𝑡) + 𝜌 𝐻 𝐻 (𝑡) + 𝜌𝑇 𝑇 (𝑡),
𝑅(𝑡)
where 𝑁 = 𝑆 +𝑈 + 𝐼 + 𝐻 +𝑇 + 𝐸 + 𝑅 denotes the total population (assumed constant).
The model is characterized by the following 11 parameters, which are chosen as time
dependent piecewise constant functions:
• 𝛽𝑈 , 𝛽 𝐼 denote the transmission rates due to contacts between a susceptible subject
and an undetected infected, a quarantined, or a hospitalized subject, respectively;
• 𝜔 𝐼 denotes the rate at which 𝐼-individuals develop clinically relevant symptoms,
while 𝜔 𝐻 denotes the rate at which 𝐻-individuals develop life-threatening symptoms;
• 𝛿 denotes the probability rate of detection, relative to undetected infected individuals;
• 𝜌𝑈 , 𝜌 𝐼 , 𝜌 𝐻 and 𝜌𝑇 denote the rate of recovery for four classes (𝑈, 𝐼, 𝐻 and 𝑇,
respectively) of infected subjects;
• 𝛾 𝐼 and 𝛾𝑇 denote the mortality rates for the individuals isolated at home, and
hosted in ICUs, respectively.
Model calibration through data fitting is essential to reproduce the past history of
the epidemic and to perform short-term forecasts by inferring the epidemiological
characteristics of COVID-19. Here we use reported isolated, hospitalized, threatened and extinct cases data to estimate the parameters of the SUIHTER model. In
particular, we perform the calibration in two steps. At first, we find a set of parameter values by using an (ordinary) least squares (LS) estimator. Then, we perform
a Bayesian calibration using the delayed rejection adaptive Metropolis (DRAM) algorithm [11] implemented in the Python library pymcmcstat [15], starting from a
prior distribution of the parameters centered about the LS estimate.
System (1) is solved in the time interval [𝑡 𝐼 , 𝑡 𝐹 ] which is subdivided into several
sub-intervals, named phases. Typically, phases change when the NPIs are modified
by the Italian Authorities. When 𝑛 𝑝ℎ phases are considered, the calibration leads to
the optimization of 𝑛 𝑝 = 11𝑛 𝑝ℎ parameters in total. Namely, for each phase of the epidemic, we have the 11 parameters given by [𝛽𝑈 , 𝛽 𝐼 , 𝜔 𝐼 , 𝜔 𝐻 , 𝛿, 𝜌𝑈 , 𝜌 𝐼 , 𝜌 𝐻 , 𝜌𝑇 , 𝛾 𝐼 , 𝛾𝑇 ].
Unfortunately, so many parameters make the calibration process difficult. In what
follows, we calibrate our model under the following simplifying assumptions:

A Dashboard for the Analysis of Italian COVID-19 Epidemic Data

19

• 𝛽 𝐼 is set to be a fraction of 𝛽𝑈 , namely 𝛽 𝐼 = 𝛼𝛽𝑈 with 𝛼 constant in all the time
frame;
• 𝛿, 𝜌𝑈 , 𝜌 𝐼 , 𝜌 𝐻 , 𝜌𝑇 , 𝛾 𝐼 , are constant on [𝑡 𝐼 , 𝑡 𝐹 ].
With these restrictions, the total number of parameters to be calibrated is reduced to
4𝑛 𝑝ℎ + 7.
More details on the initialization and numerical solution of system (1) are reported
in [16].

4.1 Results’ assessment
Scope of this section is to provide an assessment of the forecasting capability of the
SUIHTER model. More specifically, we will analyze suitability of the epidemiological model to predict the date and the height of the peaks of the curves representing
the hospitalized and hosted in ICUs compartments, focusing on the second wave at
the national scale. For each compartment, by proceeding retrospectively, in Figure
15 we display the predictions made by the SUIHTER model at different dates prior to
the date at which the corresponding curve has attained its peak value. By comparing
the predictions with the real data (see Table 2) we can draw the conclusion that
the SUIHTER model can provide accurate predictions within a week (with errors
lower than 1% on the peak value and 1 day on the peak date), and reasonably good
predictions two weeks in advance.

4.2 What-if scenarios
In this section we aim at highlighting another feature of the dashboard, the possibility
of carrying out what-if scenarios. An example is illustrated in Figure 16. Here we
simulate (by means of the SUIHTER model) what would have happened in the
case the Italian Government had anticipated by ten days the restriction measures

introduced on November 4, 20202. The difference is indeed quite striking: the peak
value for the Isolated during the second epidemic wave would have been 561 714
instead of 759 993, for the Hospitalized 25 169 instead of 34 697, for the Hosted
in ICUs 2 793 instead of 3 823. More importantly, according to our estimates, a
remarkable number of human lives would have likely been saved. Obviously, once
again we point out that these conclusions should be taken with a grain of salt,

because of the accuracy limitations of the epidemiological model. These impressive
figures prove that the most effective strategy in the early phase of an outbreak is to
enforce very strict confinement measures as early as possible. This strategy, even
if maintained for a short period, is indeed far more effective than adopting more
permissive measures (or even the very same measures) for a much longer duration
at a later stage.

4.3 Impact of the UK variant
The appearance of different virus variants (UK, Brazilian, South African) at the
end of 2020 has introduced an additional level of complexity on the managing of
the epidemic as well as on the effort of the scientific community in modeling its
dynamics (see e.g. [10]). A recent study in [7] indicates that “SARS-CoV-2 is at
an advanced stage of evolution for human infection”. Other than questioning the
vulnerability of available vaccines and current therapeutics to virus variants, the
mutations can lead to different characterizations of the epidemic, in particular of

the transmission rates (see [1]). In this respect, in the present paper, we limit our
study to the effect of virus mutations on the transmission rates that can be readily
incorporated in existing compartmental epidemiological models.
In particular, in this paper, we adapt the SUIHTER model to this new challenge
by splitting each of the compartments that spread the infection (in particular the
Undetected and the Isolated compartments) into two sub-compartments, one carrying
the baseline virus variant and the other the UK virus variant (VOC 202012/01,
lineage B.1.1.7). Recent studies (see e.g. [3]) indicate that the UK variant reached
a prevalence of 17.8% in Italy at the beginning of February 2021 and. Due to its
higher transmission rate (recently estimated in Italy as 37% higher than the one of
the baseline virus [4]), it is going to become the prevalent virus variant in March
2021.
The updated SUIHTER model accounting for the UK virus variant is governed
by the following system of ODEs (see Figure 17)

A comparison between the 30-day forecast obtained using the original SUIHTER
model and the updated model accounting for the effect of the UK virus variant
starting on February 20, 2021 is presented in Figures 18, 19 and 20 for the Isolated,
Hospitalized and Hosted in ICUs compartments, respectively.
The most remarkable differences are noticed on the Isolated, the Hospitalized, and,
at a lesser extent, the Hosted in ICUs compartments. This analysis does not account
for the vaccination campaign. Moreover, by the time we write this paper, the national

spreading of the UK variant is still highly non-uniform, with a pronounced prevalence
in a few local environments. The numerical simulation at the national scale provides
a homogenization effect which is perhaps rather inaccurate. We highlight that the
model accounting for the variant was able to predict the outbreak of the third epidemic
wave observed in Italy in late February 2021.

4.4 30-day forecast with different scenarios
Modeling the epidemic evolution by a mathematical epidemiological model such
as SUIHTER allows not only to analyse backward what-if scenario investigating
the effectiveness of past political choices (as discussed in Section 4.2), but also to
forecast the evolution of the epidemic in the near future.
As previously mentioned, the outbreak of the third epidemic wave has been
observed in Italy since the second half of February 2021. At the time of writing, this
outbreak is in its exponential growth phase and its evolution will strongly depend on
the NPIs that will be imposed in the coming weeks.
We have considered three different scenarios with different level of severity in the
NPIs:
• the first scenario considers the restriction currently imposed (on March 7, 2021)
in which some limitations are adopted at national level (use of mask, limitation of mobility among regions, limitation on recreational activities, . . . ), while
additional stricter limitations (confinement within municipality limits, distance

A Dashboard for the Analysis of Italian COVID-19 Epidemic Data

learning for school and universities, . . . ) are adopted with increasing level of
severity in yellow, orange and red regions) 3;
• the second scenario considers that all the region become yellow starting on March
8, 2021;
• the second scenario considers that all the region become red starting on March 8,
2021.
A comparison among the time evolution of the Isolated, Hospitalized and Hosted
in ICUs compartments for the three scenarios are displayed in Figures 21, 22 and 23,
respectively. As expected, when more severe restrictions are imposed the growths of
all the infecting compartments are slowed down. The results clearly highlight that
the ongoing outbreak that has been activated by the increased transmission rate of
the new virus variants could be controlled only should stricter restriction measures
be imposed as soon as possible. Without a prompt intervention the risk of a third
epidemic wave that will end up to be worse than the previous two is extremely high.

The model results displayed on the dashboard are obtained real-time running
the model any time the dashboard is interrogated, thus allowing to switch between
different forecast or what-if scenarios.

As mentioned in Section 4 and discussed in details in [16], the SUIHTER model
can be calibrated using a Monte-Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) approach for a
robust estimate of the parameters. For each parameter considered in the calibration,
the MCMC calibration starts from a prior, in our case a uniform distribution around
an initial guess computed by minimizing with a least-square minimization procedure
the difference between data and model results, and provides its posterior probability
density function.
Based on the posterior estimate of the model calibration it is possible to supply
confidence interval for the time evolution of the different compartments.
The solid curves displayed in Figure 24 represent the time evolution of the mean
value of the different compartments in the three considered scenarios, while the
shaded region surrounding each curve represents the 95% confidence interval associated with the probabilistic characterization of the model parameters.

5 Conclusions
In this paper, we presented the epiMOX dashboard for the analysis of the COVID-19
epidemic that hit northern Italy in early Spring 2020 and that is still severely affecting
the entire Country in March 2021. Data were reported for several compartments (total
and daily positive cases, isolated at home, hospitalized, hosted in ICUs, cumulative
deaths, recovered) that allow to provide a synthetic yet informative description of the
epidemic evolution. Several analyses were carried out by means of the dashboard.
A careful comparison between the first two epidemic waves (the one of Spring
2020, and the one that took off in Fall 2020) is made. Finally, we have reported
results, mainly concerning predictions, obtained by using the novel epidemiological
differential mathematical model SUIHTER. This allowed us to provide short term
forecasts on the epidemic trends, as well to examine some what-if scenarios related
to the possible implementations of different NPIs than those that had been actually
enforced.
