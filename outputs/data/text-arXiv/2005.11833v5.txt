ABSTRACT
COVID-19 has resulted in unprecedented social distancing policies
being enforced worldwide. As governments seek to restore their
economies, open workplaces and permit travel there is a demand
for technologies that may alleviate the requirement for social distancing whilst also protecting healthcare services. In this work we
explore the controversial technique of so-called immunity passports and present SecureABC: a decentralised, privacy-preserving
protocol for issuing and verifying antibody certificates. We consider the implications of antibody certificate systems, develop a set
of risk-minimising principles and a security framework for their
evaluation, and show that these may be satisfied in practice. Finally,
we also develop two additional protocols that minimise individual
discrimination but which still allow for collective transmission risk
to be estimated. We use these two protocols to illustrate the utilityprivacy trade-offs of antibody certificates and their alternatives.

INTRODUCTION

Governments worldwide are currently dealing with the Coronavirus pandemic, an outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 virus which has
already resulted in hundreds of thousands of deaths [13] and has
caused unprecedented social changes for billions of people worldwide. Most countries have responded to the pandemic with policies
aimed at enforcing social distancing, a technique certain to suppress
the transmission of the virus when it is applied uniformly to the
whole population [16]. Whilst effective, social distancing measures
come at a significant social and economic cost and may not be a feasible long-term policy option in many countries. In addition, it has
been noted that the approach may have a disproportionate impact
on disadvantaged groups in society [11]. As the effective reproduction rate (𝑅𝑡 ) is reduced below 1.0, and the number of COVID-19
cases falls, there are clear benefits to governments seeking technologies that may alleviate the requirement for population-wide
social distancing whilst also protecting healthcare services and
maintaining human and civil rights. In particular, measures such as
intensive testing, contact tracing and selective isolation have been
proposed [35].
A promising, but controversial [24], technique for relaxing the
need for population wide social distancing is the use of so called

“immunity passports” or “risk-free certificates”. In this work we
adopt for the term “antibody certificates” which we believe to be
more accurate. The general idea is that a test for antibodies to SARSCoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, could serve as the basis
for a certificate that frees an individual from the most restrictive
social distancing regulations. Assuming that strong correlates of
protection to SARS-CoV-2 can be identified, antibody certificates
could provide a key technology in enabling the transition away
from total lockdown. Chile and Estonia have already announced
plans to issue and trial such certificatees, respectively, and policy
makers in the USA, UK, Italy and Germany are also considering
the approach [17, 34]. In light of the interest already shown by
several governments, and the emergence of a number of commercial
solutions, an academic consideration of antibody certificates is
called for. In particular it is important to provide detailed technical
solutions to the problem, and to identity current limitations, so that
policy makers can be properly informed. We preface our technical
work with four risk-minimising principles which aim to address
some of the concerns surrounding antibody certificates.

Contributions
(1) We provide a framework of security and privacy requirements for antibody certificate systems. Our framework provides the basis for ensuring such systems have the correct
properties and can be evaluated on common terms.
(2) We present our SecureABC (Secure AntiBody Certificate)
protocol, a decentralised and privacy-preserving solution for
antibody certificates. We evaluate SecureABC with respect to
our framework of security and privacy requirements. More
generally, SecureABC is applicable to the emerging field of
health certification and provides a secure mechanism for
certifying health data.
(3) We provide evidence that SecureABC is efficient and practical
with our proof of concept implementation which includes
an Android application for verifying SecureABC QR codes.
(4) Finally, we explore the possibilities and limitations of technically mitigating individual health discrimination with two
protocols that do not depend on good policy. We evaluate
the trade-offs of these two protocols, and our SecureABC
solution, with respect to their utility and privacy.

Outline
First in Section 2 we review the concerns surrounding antibody
certificates and derive four general principles that may help to minimise the risk posed by these systems. Next, in Section 3 we define

Chris Hicks*, David Butler*, Carsten Maple, and Jon Crowcroft

our protocol model and introduce the required cryptographic primitives. Section 4 presents the full details of our SecureABC solution.
Then, in Section 5, we define our framework of security properties
for antibody certificates and evaluate SecureABC with respect to
them. Section 6 shows the results of our implementation of SecureABC. Section 7 details two protocols that protect individuals from
immunity-based discrimination. Finally, Sections 8 and 9 review
related work and conclude respectively.

ANTIBODY CERTIFICATE PRINCIPLES

In this section we build towards a set of general principles for
minimising the risk of an antibody certificate system. Evidence
is mounting that many nations [17, 34] are at least considering
COVID-19 antibody certificates, so it is important that techniques
for minimising the risks posed by such systems are developed. To
aid and direct our discussion we begin with a general use case in
which citizens wishing to travel on public transport are required to
present a certificate affirming that they have some level of protective
immunity to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Use case 1: basic use case. A healthcare provider will test citizens
for antibodies to COVID-19. If antibodies are found, then an antibody certificate will be issued. The citizen can now present their
certificate to the transport service provider who, after establishing
the authenticity of the certificate, will allow access to transportation.

2.1

Antibody Certificate Concerns

Antibody certificates have attracted significant criticism. Here we
condense the main concerns of Kofler et al. [24] and the WHO [5]:
Alterations to scientific advice. As a novel disease, COVID-19
is not yet well understood by the scientific community [26]. For
example, the WHO express concern that the presence of antibodies
is not an accurate indicator of immunity and state that such tests
“need further validation to determine their accuracy and reliability”
[5].
Discrimination. Antibody certificates will create an attribute for
discrimination [34] by establishing a clear distinction between those
with antibodies and those without. A report by the Ada Lovelace
Institute emphasises that “Discrimination and stigmatisation may
become commonplace if immunity becomes an element of identity”
[21]. Additional inequality could be introduced if tests are not
universally and freely available to all – antibody certificates, and
the associated freedoms, could become a luxury of the rich.
May negatively impact behavior. An antibody certificate could
become synonymous with freedom as those in possession could be
allowed access to “the post-lockdown world” while those without
could remain subject to social distancing policies. This may create
a strong incentive for people to attempt to obtain a certificate by
any means. Coupled with the belief that having, and surviving, the
virus corresponds to gaining immunity [14, 18], it is hypothesised
that antibody certificates may actively encourage people to try to
become infected. It has also been shown that believing one has
immunity could lead people to behave less cautiously [39].

Feature creep. In response to COVID-19, Governments are exercising a heightened level of control and surveillance over their
populations [10, 40]. Antibody certificate systems could provide
authorities with an opportunity to implement technologies, and to
collect data, that could have unanticipated negative consequences
on society [21].
These concerns are persuasive in advocating against antibody
certificates in the basic use case setting we have described. We
are therefore motivated to address these concerns with a set of
general principles which aim to minimise, where possible, the risks
associated with antibody certificates.

2.2

Risk Mitigating Principles

Principles for minimising the risk of antibody certificates.
Rename, educate and allow revocation. Until there is strong
evidence of protective immunity (and its correlates) to COVID19, the word “immunity” should not be used. This is misleading at
best and dangerously inaccurate at worst – creating a false sense
of security [39]. We opt for “antibody certificate” as it reflects the
function more accurately. We note that in [33] Persad and Emanuel
also advocate for a name other than “immunity passports”, although
we would argue that their “immunity-license” is still somewhat misleading. Beyond semantics, appropriate levels of public education
with regard the benefits and limitations of antibody certificates is
vital. Indeed, the Information Commissioners Office (ICO) strongly
advocate being transparent about the purpose and benefit of the
closely related contact tracing technology [20]. Finally, we call for
systems which support efficient and fast revocation of certificates
and service providers. This is essential to maintain pace with the
fast-changing scientific understanding and dynamic policies which
relate to COVID-19.
Access to testing and technology. Wealth, location and demographic profile must not impact access to obtaining or using a
certificate. In other words, beyond their specified purpose, antibody certificates must avoid any additional discrimination. The
Ada Lovelace Institute report [21] similarly calls for “measures for
ensuring vulnerable groups are not excluded from the operation of
the system” in relation to antibody certificates. In the case of contact tracing, the ICO state that “special consideration for different
societal groups” is paramount.
Proportional and necessary use. As an inherently discriminatory technology we recognise that antibody certificates must be
used cautiously. We advocate that restrictions imposed by antibody certification upon freedom of movement, or access to services,
must be strictly necessary and proportional to the specific risks and
harms of COVID-19 transmission in each particular use-case. We
note that in their draft Coronavirus Bill [44] Edwards et al. emphasise that proportionality is the key to reducing discrimination. To
ensure that verifiers behave according to agreed guidelines, mechanisms should be in place which allow a user to determine that a
service provider is authorised before presenting their certificate.
Such “mutual authorisation” between users and service providers
will provide a higher degree of confidence to users.

SecureABC: Secure AntiBody Certificates for COVID-19

Maintain user ownership of data. An antibody certificate system should be designed in such a way that users can, at all times,
control the use of their data. In particular, users must control when
and where to use their data to demonstrate their test result. This is
aligned with the ICO’s principle of “giving users control” [20] with
regard to contact tracing.
These principles, in particular ensuring the necessity and proportionality of antibody certificates for each use case, likely rule
out our basic use case. We hence provide two additional use cases
that may present a more favourable balance between the risks of
antibody certificates and the benefit of their application.
Use case 2: indicating user risk. Consider the basic use case
where users of a public transport system are required to show their
antibody certificate before making a journey. Under our risk minimising principles we advocate that certificates are still checked;
however, access is granted to all. In this scenario, antibody certificates can still provide a benefit by allowing testing, cleaning and
other mitigating techniques to be optimised based on the relative
use of each service by untested and tested-negative citizens.
Use case 3: helping vulnerable members of society. When providing food delivery services for vulnerable people who cannot
safely leave their home, preferring the carrier to hold an antibody
certificate could reduce the risk faced by the recipient. This scenario, in which the carrier would hold an antibody certificate and
her employer verify that it is valid, could represent a necessary
and proportional trade-off between restricting access to work and
minimising the risk faced by vulnerable groups.

MODEL AND PRELIMINARIES

Our antibody certificate protocol model comprises three parties.
We denote the Healthcare provider as Harry (𝐻 ), the citizen or user
of the scheme as Alice (𝐴) and the service provider, who Verifies
user certificates, as Verity (𝑉 ). Our general model is outlined in
Figure 1: in step (1) 𝐴 gets tested for antibodies by 𝐻 . In step (2), if
the test detects an appropriate number of antibodies, 𝐻 signs an
antibody certificate which is sent to 𝐴. In step (3), after mutually
authenticating, 𝐴 presents her certificate to 𝑉 and then finally, in
step (4), 𝑉 checks the authenticity (i.e. that is was created by 𝐻 )
and attributes of the certificate (e.g. by matching a photo and name
to 𝐴). Our system model assumes a root of trust in the system,
for example the government, that implicitly authorises both 𝐻
and 𝑉 as legitimate entities. A root of trust is needed because a
verifier 𝑉 cannot reasonably be expected to know in advance all of
the healthcare providers that can be trusted to authorise antibody
certificates. Similarly, the user 𝐴 cannot be expected to always know
which particular verifiers can be trusted to verify their antibody
certificates.

3.1

Preliminaries

SecureABC requires both a secure public key signature scheme and
a secure public key encryption scheme. Both of these schemes are
made up of three algorithms. The first algorithm generates a public
key pair, the second either signs or encrypts and the third verifies
the signature or decrypts the ciphertext, respectively. We denote

Figure 1: Our general model of an antibody certificate protocol run between a healthcare provider, a user and a service
provider.

the signature scheme by the tuple (key-gensign, sign, verify) and the
encryption scheme by the tuple (key-genenc , enc, dec).
We use a signature scheme to allow the healthcare provider to
sign antibody certificates and therefore, intuitively, we require the
signature scheme to be unforgeable. Specifically, we require it to
be EUF-CMA (Existential Unforgeability under Chosen Message
Attack) secure. Rather than define this standard property here, we
refer the reader to Goldwasser et al. [19] for the common definition. We note that the standard Elliptic Curve Digital Signature
Algorithm (ECDSA) [12] is sufficient for our needs.
We use the encryption scheme in the authentication phase for
app-based users. Here the user encrypts their signed certificate such
that only an authorized, non-revoked service provider can decrypt
it (we discuss this property in more detail when evaluating our
scheme in Section 5). Our particular use of an encryption scheme
means that any public key encryption scheme that is at least INDCPA secure will suffice. For a standard definition of IND-CPA we
refer the reader to Katz and Lindell [23].

SecureABC

In this section we present SecureABC, our secure antibody certificate scheme that realises the model defined in Section 3. SecureABC
is a distributed, privacy-preserving antibody certificate protocol
that allows for both paper-based and app-based user credentials.
Providing printable, paper-based credentials is important because
even in the most developed countries, the adoption of smartphones
is not absolute. Indeed, requiring the use of electronic devices may
exclude vulnerable user groups [11] and limit the reach of any
deployment. We seek to provide strong privacy guarantees regardless of whether a user has a device capable of displaying a digital
passport or not. In particular we seek to replicate the privacy of
traditional identity documents, such as driver’s licenses, which do
not notify the issuer each time they are presented.
As noted in Section 3 our model assumes a common trust anchor,
such as the government, that authorises both 𝐻 and 𝑉 as legitimate
entities. In practice this means that every time 𝐻 or 𝑉 generate a
new public key, the government signs it to indicate that it can be
trusted. For brevity we implicitly assume this to be the case for all
relevant keys.

High level overview of SecureABC
The SecureABC protocol comprises three phases: Setup, Issue and
Authentication. The Setup protocol is run by 𝐻 , who generates the
public key pair for the signature scheme he will use to sign antibody
certificates. Next, the Issue phase is run between 𝐻 and 𝐴. At the
end of the Issue phase 𝐴 receives an antibody certificate, signed by
𝐻 , which she can use to demonstrate her antibody status to service
providers. Finally, the Authentication phase is run between 𝐴 and 𝑉 .
This phase allows 𝑉 to convince 𝐴 that she is an authorised service
provider and allows 𝐴 to convince 𝑉 that she has a valid antibody
certificate. We provide two Authentication phase sub-protocols
which allow 𝐴 to choose between using either a paper-based or an
app-based credential.

The SecureABC Protocol
The Setup, Issue and Authentication phases of the SecureABC protocol are as follows.
Setup
𝐻 initialises the set of revoked Certificate ID ((CID) numbers rev =
{}, the set of revoked verifier public keys revV = {} and generates
the public and private key for the signature scheme:
(𝑝𝑘𝐻 , 𝑠𝑘𝐻 ) ← key-gensign (·)
Issue
𝐻 interacts with 𝐴 to issue a signed antibody certificate.
(1) 𝐴 is tested for antibodies by 𝐻 , who records the test identity
number (TID) that produced the test result. If the test is
positive for antibodies, and 𝐴 has not already been issued
a certificate, then 𝐻 generates a random (CID, initialises
a corresponding revocation bit 𝑏 CID = False and specifies
a validity period dateCID . 𝐻 stores (CID, TID, 𝑏 CID , dateCID )
informs 𝐴 of her test result.
(2) 𝐴 provides 𝐻 with a photograph, photoA , and a communication channel, commA , which will be used to send passport
status updates (e.g. upon revocation or test recall). In practice, 𝐴 will choose one of a small number of communication
options such as SMS, email or post.
(3) 𝐻 appends commA to the record he holds for 𝐴 and then
sends her the signed antibody certificate certA which is computed as follows:
certA = sign𝑝𝑘𝐻 (nameA, photoA, dateCID , CID)
Certificates can either be paper-based or app-based, in Section 6
we show how QR codes can be used to encode such certificates. In
the remainder of this paper we assume this encoding.
In the interests of mitigating economic discrimination, we recommend that if a user is unable, or unwilling, to provide a photograph
then they are able to obtain one of the required standard for free
during the issue phase. One option could be to create a mobile app
that can be used by 𝐻 to take such photographs on behalf of each
user, it is important however that any such image is deleted by 𝐻 as
soon as the certificate has been issued. All of this could be handled
automatically by a suitable audited application.

Authentication
𝐴 interacts with 𝑉 to demonstrate the authenticity and ownership
of her antibody certificate. Authentication must be mutual, that
is first 𝐴 must be convinced that 𝑉 is authorised by the government before allowing her to verify her certificate. 𝐴’s certificates
are either paper-based or app-based we require two different authentication sub-protocols which correspond to the manual and
automated authentication of 𝑉 by 𝐴, respectively. In both authentication sub-protocols, 𝑉 runs an app which she uses to scan and
verify 𝐴’s credential. The app also periodically downloads the list
of revoked CID numbers rev and 𝐻 ’s public key 𝑝𝑘𝐻 . The rev list
should be signed by 𝐻 to demonstrate its authenticity. We benchmark the performance of this app in Section 6.
Paper-Based Authentication
𝐴 has certA and 𝑉 has the list of revoked CID numbers rev and 𝐻 ’s
public key 𝑝𝑘𝐻 .
(1) 𝐴 must manually convince herself that 𝑉 is a governmentauthorised service provider, for example based on context
or viewing an identity document. If this step fails 𝐴 aborts
the protocol.
(2) 𝐴 shows her certificate certA to 𝑉 .
(3) 𝑉 verifies certA . That is she confirms verifypkH (certA ) =
True, and learns nameA , photoA , dateCID and CID. She checks
that CID has not been revoked i.e. CID ∉ rev, then compares
photoA to 𝐴 and ensures that dateCID has not elapsed. Optionally, if she deems it necessary for verification, 𝑉 may
ask to see a second document bearing nameA — this process
would happen offline1 .
App-Based Authentication
𝐴 runs an app that stores her antibody certificate certA and which
periodically downloads a list of revoked verifier public keys, 𝑟𝑒𝑣𝑉 ,
from the government. 𝑉 has a list of revoked CID numbers, 𝐻 ’s public key 𝑝𝑘𝐻 , an encryption public key pair (𝑝𝑘𝑉 , 𝑠𝑘𝑉 ) ← key-genenc (·)
and a public-key certificate signed by H, cert𝑉 ← sign𝑠𝑘𝐻 (𝑝𝑘𝑉 ).
(1) 𝑉 sends cert𝑉 to 𝐴. In practice, 𝐴 uses the app to scan a
QR code or read an NFC tag provided by 𝑉 . 𝐴 verifies 𝑐𝑒𝑟𝑡𝑉
and ensures is not on the revocation list, i.e. 𝑝𝑘𝑉 ∉ rev𝑉 ∧
verify𝑝𝑘𝐻 (𝑐𝑒𝑟𝑡𝑉 ) = True. If either of these steps fail, then 𝐴
aborts the protocol.
′ = enc
(2) 𝐴 computes cert 𝐴
𝑝𝑘𝑉 (cert 𝐴 ) which is displayed as a
QR code and scanned by 𝑉 .
′ ) and then
(3) 𝑉 decrypts 𝐴’s certificate cert 𝐴 = dec𝑠𝑘𝑉 (cert 𝐴
proceeds as in Step 3 of the paper-based authentication protocol.
If either the paper-based or app-based authentication protocol
succeeds then 𝑉 accepts 𝐴’s antibody certificate, otherwise she
does not. It is important to note that the use of encryption in our
app-based authentication protocol is an opportunistic enhancement
which provides slightly improved security properties for app-users.
More details on this point are provided in our evaluation which
follows. While not strictly part of the protocol we next detail how
revocation would be achieved.
1 We

envisage 𝑉 asking for this second factor only if she was unconvinced the photo
provided strong binding, or if the use case demanded extra precautions to ensure the
user was in fact the holder of the certificate.

SecureABC: Secure AntiBody Certificates for COVID-19

Revocation.
𝐻 periodically computes, signs and distributes rev (e.g. daily) such
that it comprises all CID numbers in his private store that have the
revocation bit 𝑏 CID = True. We claim this is sufficient for efficient
revocation of certificates and, we illustrate the exact procedures for
different use cases in our evaluation which follows.

SECURITY PROPERTIES AND EVALUATION

In this section we first present a general framework of security
properties for the evaluation of antibody certificate protocols and
then we then evaluate SecureABC with respect to these properties
and also the general principles which we set out in Section 2.

5.1

Security Properties

Here we provide a basic set of properties for evaluating the security
of antibody certificate systems. It is unlikely that any scheme can
simultaneously satisfy all of these properties as several of them
present a trade-off. For example, there is an inherent compromise
between the anonymity of user certificates and the binding between
the user and their certificate. We provide additional detail for some
properties to help guide the reader.
Forge and Tamper Proof. We say the system is forge proof if a
user cannot create a valid certificate alone. That is valid certificates
can only be created for 𝐴 by 𝐻 . Similarly, we say the system is tamper proof if the value of the attributes associated with a certificate
cannot be altered by the user after the certificate has been issued.
Binding. We require that the only certificate a user can successfully
use is the one that is assigned to them and which has not been
revoked.
Uniqueness. Uniqueness is satisfied if a user can have at most one
valid certificate associated to them at any one time. – We note that
this property is important when binding is imperfect, for example
when considering twins that may not share the same antibody
test result.
Peer-Indistinguishability. We define a peer as an unauthorised
service provider (for example, a malicious citizen). We require that
a peer cannot learn any information about the user from viewing
the certificate. – Intuitively, peer-indistinguishability ensures that
a user cannot be pressured into revealing their certificate by
anyone except an authorised service provider, this alleviates the
“bully on the bus” problem.
Unlinkability. We consider unlinkability from the healthcare provider
and the service provider in turn.
• From healthcare provider: The healthcare provider cannot link
a user to their authentication phase interactions.
• From service provider: The service provider cannot link a user
to a previous authentication phase interaction.
Revocation of certificates. We require that a user’s certificate can
be revoked by the issuer. Certificates may be invalidated for a
number of reasons, we give three examples below:
• Loss and theft: If a certificate becomes lost or compromised.

• Error: If a batch of tests are recalled because they were incorrect.
• Misuse: If evidence of certificate misuse is presented.
Revocation of service providers. We require that a service provider
can be revoked from the list of authorised providers. – an authorised
service provider may be revoked in the following situations:
• Change of policy: A change in government policy may mean
some service providers are no longer authorised.
• Sanctioning: If a service provider is deemed to not be following
recommended guidelines it may lose its authorised status.

5.2

Evaluation

Here we evaluate the SecureABC system in relation to the security
properties and then with respect our general principles from Section
2. Table 1 compares the properties observed by the paper-based
and app-based authentication mechanisms of SecureABC. In this
work we only aim to provide an intuition for each property rather
than a rigorous proof.
Forge and Tamper Proof. Here we consider the theoretical enforcement of the forge and tamper proof properties in SecureABC.
Under the standard assumption that the underlying signature
scheme is EUF-CMA secure, SecureABC is both forge and tamper
proof. At a technical level the forge proof property is reduced to
the unforgeability of the signature scheme. Moreover, the tamper
proof property can also be reduced to the forge proof property
as, in order to tamper with the value of the certificate, the user
must also forge the corresponding signature.
Binding. Alice is bound to her certificate by the photograph and
name that are signed by Harry. This can be considered a strong
binding property and is in line with current socially accepted
verification mechanisms such as photocard driving licenses.
Uniqueness. In the Issue phase Harry checks that to see if Alice
currently has a valid certificate. Consequently, uniqueness is
satisfied to the degree that it is already assured for medical record
keeping.
Peer-Indistinguishability.
• Paper-based: The paper-based authentication sub-protocol provides poor peer indistinguishability for users. In particular, the
protocol only guards against non-technical peers without the
ability to scan QR codes.
• App-based: The app-based authentication sub-protocol realises
the peer indistinguishability property. This is achieved by enforcing mutual authentication between Alice and Verity. Here
Verity is required to present a valid public key, signed by the
government, which has not been revoked. Recall that since
Verity’s public key is signed using an EUF-CMA secure signature scheme, peer indistinguishability can be reduced to the
difficulty of forging a government signature.
Unlinkability.
• From healthcare provider: SecureABC is decentralized after
the issue phase. More precisely, the healthcare provider (or
any central authority for that matter) is not involved in the

Chris Hicks*, David Butler*, Carsten Maple, and Jon Crowcroft

protocol after the issue phase. Consequently to link the user
to an authentication the healthcare provider would have to
collude with the service providers, we assume this does not
happen.
• From service provider: Since the service provider learns when
a user authenticates with them, this property is not satisfied.
If multiple service providers collude, then the colluding group
all learn the linking.
Revocation of Certificates. Recall that Harry periodically computes, signs and distributes rev (e.g. daily) such that it comprises
all CID numbers in his private store that have the revocation bit
𝑏 CID = True. Then, for the use-cases in Section 2, revocation of
certificates can be realised as follows:
• Loss: If Alice’s certificate becomes lost or compromised, she
must inform Harry. Harry looks up her CID and sets the revocation bit 𝑏 CID = True in his private store.
• Error: If a test result is recalled due to clinical error, Harry
uses the TID number to identify the corresponding CID in his
private store and then sets the revocation bit 𝑏 CID = True.
• Misuse: If evidence of certificate misuse3 emerges, a trusted
authority (e.g. a court) should inform Harry of the CID that
was misused. Harry then sets the corresponding revocation bit
𝑏 CID = True.
Revocation of Service Providers.
• Paper-based: Our paper-based authentication does not provide
technically enforced revocation of service providers. This property can only be obtained if a user is constantly educated as to
which service providers are no longer authorized. For example,
daily updates on coronavirus from the UK government have
included details on which services and shops are allowed to
operate.
• App-based: This property is satisfied by the app-based authentication sub-protocol. Authentication only succeeds if, in the
mutual authentication phase, the service provider sends the
user a public key 𝑝𝑘𝑉 that is signed by the government and
which is not on the list of revoked verifiers revV . Since the user
encrypts their antibody certificate using 𝑝𝑘𝑉 , the verifier must
have the corresponding private key 𝑝𝑘𝑉 .

SecureABC and the General Principles

Here we position SecureABC with respect to the general principles
we formulate in Section 2. Some of the components of our general principles, for example educating the public, are naturally out
of scope when presenting a technical solution to antibody certificates; thus, we consider only those aspects that are relevant to the
SecureABC protocol.
Rename, educate and allow revocation. We follow our naming
principle. SecureABC provides Secure AntiBody Certificates and
implies neither immunity nor freedom of travel. Moreover SecureABC provides efficient and accurate revocation of both user
certificates and, for app users only, service providers.
Access to testing and technology. We address digital exclusion
in SecureABC by providing both a paper-based and app-based
authentication protocol. In addition, we prescribe that Harry
takes the photo of Alice in the issue phase. These design decisions
ensure that access to (or willingness to use) technology including
a “passport photo machine” does not discriminate against certain
user groups.
Proportional and necessary use. Whilst this is ultimately a policy decision, we suggest two potentially proportional use cases
for SecureABC in Section 2.
Maintain user ownership of data. After the initial issue phase,
SecureABC is a decentralised system in which users authenticate
directly with service providers. This keeps the user in control
of when their data is used, and for what purpose, and may both
minimise feature creep by governments and facilitate dismantling
the system.

IMPLEMENTATION AND PERFORMANCE

In this section we review the implementation and practical considerations of the SecureABC antibody certificate protocol and present
the results of our reference implementation.

6.1

QR Codes

In our proof of concept implementation we have chosen to use QR
codes to represent the signed antibody certificates that are issued
to users. QR codes are a reasonable candidate for this purpose because they are a widely adopted, mature technology that offers
both machine-readability and error tolerance. There are a range of
libraries suitable for reading and writing QR codes, users understand how to interact with them, and they are resistant to wear and
tear when printed. Attacks on QR code systems are surveyed by
Krombholz et al. [25].
The storage capacity of a QR code is determined by a “symbol
version” number between 1 and 40. Higher symbol numbers correspond to a higher storage capacity. The maximum storage capacity
for a standard QR code is 2953 bytes [28]. If a higher storage capacity
is desired, for example for a higher resolution user photograph, our
SecureABC protocol readily supports alternative technologies such
as multi-layered QR codes [29, 41] and Microsoft High Capacity
Color Barcode (HCCB) [31].

6.2

Proof of Concept

We have created an open source proof of concept implementation
of the critical SecureABC components which can be found at [8].
Firstly, our implementation allows for user credentials to be signed
and compiled as a QR code as shown in Figure 2. This corresponds
to the issue phase of our protocol. Secondly, we have implemented
an Android application that runs the authentication phase of our
protocol. In more detail, the application can read a SecureABC QR

Performance and Scalability

Here we first provide benchmarks for our implementation and
then highlight some limiting factors and initial insights regarding
optimisation. Finally, we consider the scalability and usability of
our proposal.
SecureABC only requires highly efficient cryptographic algorithms; both signing and verification of antibody certificates are
simply the standard ECDSA algorithms. Using our Python implementation on an Intel Core i9 Macbook, complete end-to-end SecureABC QR code generation takes less than 8 seconds. Recall that
this is a one-time operation and, although this performance is already persuasive, we note that less than 2 seconds are spent actually

signing the certificate data and the remainder is spent on the generation of the QR code. We discuss this further when considering
optimisations below.
While issuance is a one-time process, user authentication occurs
many times and is the more performance critical component. The
results of our Android implementation show that a 521-bit ECDSA
signature using the NIST standard curve P-521 can be verified in 3
ms using a Samsung Galaxy S9+ smartphone.
Next, we discuss our initial findings regarding optimisation. Our
reference implementation allowed us to both better understand
the potential of digital barcode technologies and recognise the specific limitations of QR codes. Firstly, encoding binary data into
a QR code is beyond the specification of most standard libraries.
This limitation required us to encode the user photograph using a
printable representation before writing to a barcode. In particular
our Android implementation requires base 64 encoding the user
photograph before it is compiled into a QR code. This adds a very
significant 33% overhead to the number of bytes that presently need
to be included in the QR code. While our current implementation is
sufficient to demonstrate the fundamentals of our approach, resolving this limitation would substantially improve the usability of our
system by allowing for both smaller QR codes and a higher level
of error correction. Experimentally we found that smaller version
number QR codes were much faster to read, and less error prone,
than their higher capacity counterparts.
Regarding scalability, since our solution is decentralised and
offline from any certificate issuer or revocation identity, there are
inherently few issues to be considered. Nonetheless, each healthcare
provider must maintain a database of user records which includes
the CID of their antibody certificate. In practice healthcare providers
must already maintain patient records on the same scale as is required for antibody certificates and the addition of an extra field
should not be problematic. For revocation, service providers must
download the list of revoked CIDs from each healthcare provider
and users must download the list of revoked verifiers. This can
easily be automated and is amenable to alternative techniques such
as OCSP [36] should the scale of revocation prove to contraindicate
basic revocation lists in practice.
Lastly, while conducting usability studies of our approach is outside the scope of this work, we believe that the simple user interface
shown in Fig. 2 is encouraging in this regard. We note that key
management in SecureABC is, for users, a relatively straightforward matter of looking after their QR code in the same way as
they might a photocard driver’s license, a bank card or indeed – a
mobile phone. Lost or stolen certificates are handled by contacting
the healthcare issuer to receive a replacement.

WAYS TO MITIGATE DISCRIMINATION

The SecureABC system we present in Section 4, and indeed all
forms of antibody certification, rely on policy and regulation to
ensure that any resulting immunity-based discrimination is both
proportional and necessary. In this section we are motivated to
explore the ways in which individual discrimination could be technically mitigated, in a privacy preserving way, whilst still providing
a mechanism for computing aggregate information about infection
risks. Aggregate infection risk statistics are already being used by

Chris Hicks*, David Butler*, Carsten Maple, and Jon Crowcroft

countries that have adopted “local lockdown” mechanisms which
monitor regional COVID-19 risk and accordingly adjust policy. Currently, this information comes from local testing and reporting2
and is therefore unable to capture transmission risks at the level of
individual transport routes, workplaces or stores.
Use case 4: aggregate transmission risk statistics. A national
healthcare authority seeks to localise and mitigate COVID-19 outbreaks at the level of individual physical spaces. For this purpose,
people entering a space will provide a health token that will allow
the service provider to compute the aggregate sum of transmission
risk over some arbitrary period such as a day or a week. Such statistics might help to reduce the need for more extensive regional or
even national restrictions by allowing for more precisely targeted
interventions.
We first present two potential solutions for realising such health
tokens before discussing the trade-offs with respect to discrimination.

7.1

Randomised Health Tokens

Here we present the concept of a randomised health token for transmission risk; a randomised health token that allows the collective
transmission risk posed by groups of users to be estimated whilst
also protecting individuals from immunity-based discrimination.
To realise randomised health tokens we employ randomised response, a commonly used method to provide differential privacy, to
issue users with health tokens based on their “immunity status” or
transmission risk. Each user’s transmission risk is potentially randomised but can nonetheless be used to reconstruct the underlying
distribution of real risk over a sufficiently large number users. Before defining our randomised health token protocol, we first detail
our randomised response protocol protocol DP .
Randomised response protocol. Let protocol DP take as input the
user’s true transmission risk status 𝑖 true ∈ {0, . . . , 𝑘 − 1} which
can be one of 𝑘 options and 𝜖. Here 𝜖 is a measure of the trade-off
between privacy and accuracy; a low value of epsilon provides high
privacy, since each user’s risk status is more likely to be noise, but
reduced utility for much the same reason. The protocol DP outputs
𝜖 −1
𝑖 true with probability 𝑒 𝜖𝑒+𝑘−1
, else we select a uniformly random response from {0, . . . , 𝑘 − 1}. Clearly it is possible to select a response
at random and to still provide the true value 𝑖 true by chance.
An unbiased estimate 𝑓ˆ of the frequency 𝑓 of a given risk status
𝑖 true ∈ {0, . . . , 𝑘 − 1} is calculated as follows:
𝑒𝜖 + 𝑘 − 1 ˜
( 𝑓 − 1/𝑘).
𝑓ˆ =
𝑒𝜖 − 1

(1)

Randomised health tokens protocol. The randomised health tokens
protocol comprises three phases: issue, authentication and aggregation.
Issue
(1) 𝐻 assesses 𝐴’s transmission risk indicator to be 𝑖 true .
(2) 𝐻 computes iDP ← 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑡𝑜𝑐𝑜𝑙𝐷𝑃 (𝑖 true , 𝜖) and composes
tokenDP = signPKH {iDP , dateissue , dateend }
2 https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/coronavirus--covid-19--cases

where dateissue and dateend are the date the health token is
issued and expires, respectively.
(3) 𝐴 receives her true rest result 𝑖 true and her randomised health
token tokenDP .
Authentication
(1) 𝐴 presents tokenDP to 𝑉 when accessing a physical space.
(2) 𝑉 verifies 𝐻 ’s signature on tokenDP , validates 𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑒𝑛𝑑 and,
if successful, records the randomised transmission risk iDP .
Aggregate
(1) Periodically, 𝑉 counts the frequency 𝑓 of each value of iDP
it has received during the period. 𝑉 then debiases the frequency estimates as per Equation 1 to recover an unbiased
transmission risk distribution.
Each randomised health token is cryptographically signed by
𝐻 and therefore cannot be forged by the user. The bitstring representation of each signature will be unique (except for a negligible
probability) for each health token and therefore constitutes a unique
identifier. This unique identifier may be used to revoke health tokens that are misused, for example using a privacy-preserving
technique such as [30]. Note that regardless of the randomised
transmission risk value 𝑖 DP , 𝐴 still learns her true transmission risk
𝑖 true during the issue phase of the protocol. This method allows
service providers to obtain an accurate estimate of the risk they
have encountered, while providing plausible deniability to all users
whose tokens are authenticated.

7.2

Secret-Shared Health Tokens

If one or more additional trusted parties can be assumed, then
privacy-preserving transmission risk aggregates can also be computed without the requirement of adding noise to individual risk
values. Our method is to use a Linear Secret Sharing Scheme (LSSS)
to encrypt user transmission risk values. These encrypted values
will enable the service provider 𝑉 and an additional third-party
helper server 𝑊 to jointly compute the sum of many users transmission risk. Provided that at least one of these two parties remains
honest then secret-shared health tokens provide stronger privacy
than randomised health tokens – the system leaks nothing about a
user’s transmission risk to the service provider, except what can be
inferred from the final sum.
7.2.1 Secret-shared health tokens protocol. Let 𝑝 denote a large
prime and (𝑝𝑘𝑊 , 𝑠𝑘𝑊 ) ← key-genenc (·) denote the public key of
an independent third-party 𝑊 that will assist in the protocol. Furthermore, let both 𝑉 and 𝑊 initialise an accumulator value, 𝑗𝑉 = 0
and 𝑗𝑊 = 0 respectively, which will be used to sum the shares
in each reporting period. For example, 𝑊 could be a university
or a health organisation separate from the government. Then the
secret-shared health tokens protocol comprises three phases: issue,
authentication and aggregation which are defined as follows.
Issue
(1) 𝐻 assesses 𝐴’s transmission risk indicator to be 𝑖 true .
(2) 𝐻 computes two random shares [𝑖 true ]𝑉 and [𝑖 true ]𝑊 such
that 𝑖 true = [𝑖 true ]𝑉 + [𝑖 true ]𝑊 mod 𝑝.

SecureABC: Secure AntiBody Certificates for COVID-19

(3) 𝐻 encrypts [𝑖 true ]𝑊 using 𝑊 ’s public key 𝑝𝑘𝑊 and then
signs the resulting encrypted secret share:

share𝑊 = signPKH enc𝑝𝑘𝑊 ([𝑖 true ]𝑊 )
(4) Let share𝑉 = [𝑖 true ]𝑉 , then 𝐻 composes the secret-shared
health token as:
tokenSS = signPKH {share𝑊 , share𝑉 , 𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑒 issue, 𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑒 end }
(5) 𝐴 receives her true rest result 𝑖 true and her secret-shared
health token tokenSS .
Authentication
(1) 𝐴 presents tokenSS to 𝑉 when accessing a physical space.
(2) 𝑉 verifies 𝐻 ’s signature on tokenSS and validates 𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑒𝑛𝑑 . 𝑉
aborts this phase of the protocol if this step fails.
(3) 𝑉 sends sends share𝑊 to 𝑊 and then adds share𝑉 to its local
accumulator value for this period: 𝑗𝑉 = 𝑗𝑉 + share𝑉 mod 𝑝
(4) 𝑊 receives share𝑊 , verifies 𝐻 ’s signature, decrypts the secretshared token using 𝑠𝑘𝑊 and then adds the result to its local accumulator value for this period: 𝑗𝑊 = 𝑗𝑊 + [𝑖 true ]𝑊
mod 𝑝.
Aggregate
(1) 𝑉 and 𝑊 publish their accumulator values 𝑗𝑉 and 𝑗𝑊 , respectively. Computing the sum of these values yields the
sum of all of the transmission risk values provided by each
user during the reporting period:
∑︁
𝑗𝑉 + 𝑗𝑊 =
𝑖 true mod 𝑝

Table 2: Utility-privacy trade-offs of the protocols we

trade-off here is that these privacy-preserving techniques sacrifice their utility in cases where it is imperative to distinguish
individuals.
Ideal Accuracy Both SecureABC and secret-shared health tokens
provide the ideal level of accuracy. In other words, the risk or antibody status assigned to users by their healthcare provider communicated without error to the service provider. In randomised
health tokens, privacy is provided by adding noise (and hence
deniability) to each users’ transmission risk and therefore ideal accuracy is not realised. As we show in Figure 3, this error becomes
increasingly small as the number of users over which aggregate
risk is computed becomes large.

As the end of the aggregation phase, both 𝑉 and 𝑊 learn the
Í
sum 𝑖 𝑖 true mod 𝑝 but they learn nothing more about the user’s
private transmission risk values. Since all secret shares are signed
by H, this protocol is robust against adversarial user inputs that
could aim to corrupt the sum.

7.3

Utility-Privacy Trade-Off

The two protocols described previously demonstrate that it is both
technically feasible and efficient to retain some utility in systems
which mitigate immunity-based discrimination. Here we are motivated to explore this trade-off between the utility of individual
discrimination and the privacy of individual transmission risk. We
compare the three protocols we specify in this work – SecureABC,
randomised health tokens, and secret-shared health tokens; under
four categories: (1) health discrimination, (2) level of accuracy, (3)
the necessity of binding and (4) the need for an additional trusted
entity beyond 𝐻 . Table 2 summaries the trade-offs which we now
consider individually in detail.
Mitigates Discrimination All traditional antibody certificate systems, including the SecureABC protocol, are discriminatory by
design. A user is strongly bound to their certificate and only
good governance can ensure the necessity and proportionality of
its usage. Whilst discrimination may of course be bad in many
circumstances, as we discuss in Section 2 there could be use cases
where it is preferable to a worse alternative. In contrast, both our
randomised and secret-shared health token proposals mitigate
discrimination by concealing individual health records and only
allowing aggregates of risk to be computed. The utility-privacy

Figure 3: The average error introduced by our system for a
given number of users. We let 𝑘 = 2 and plot the error for
𝜖 = 𝑙𝑜𝑔 ( 53 ), 𝜖 = 𝑙𝑜𝑔 (3), 𝜖 = 𝑙𝑜𝑔 (7) and 𝑘 = 2.
Binding Necessary Binding to the owner of a certificate is necessary when the certificate entitles the bearer to special access or
privilege. Since SecureABC allows antibody status to be proven
by design, it also lends itself to entitling the bearer of a favourable
certificate to special privileges. For example, a SecureABC credential could be required for access to jobs which involve working with vulnerable people. By comparison our randomised and

Chris Hicks*, David Butler*, Carsten Maple, and Jon Crowcroft

secret-shared health tokens are about collective risk rather than
individual privilege, and therefore may not necessarily need binding to the individual. The utility-privacy trade-off is that the any
solution which requires binding must compromise privacy to
the extent that an individual needs to strongly prove ownership.
Whilst there are solutions that accomplish this without disclosing personal information such as a name or photograph, they
ultimately still require some accountability to the individual.
Trusted Entities All of our protocols require at least one root
of trust. The healthcare authority 𝐻 must be trusted to issue
antibody tests, collect the results and digitally sign them into credentials that are given to users. For app-users of the SecureABC
protocol, 𝐻 also allows them to verify the service provider before
showing their antibody certificate. In addition, the secret-shared
health tokens protocol requires at least one additional third-party
to be trusted to help aggregate secret shares in cooperation with
each service provider. The trade-off of secret-shared health tokens is that this additional trusted entity is required to ensure
discrimination on the basis of individual risk values is mitigated.
These trade-offs between utility, privacy and individual discrimination motivate us to suggest that a combination of both SecureABC
and either randomised or secret-shared health tokens could provide
enhanced outcomes. Integrating such a system would hinge on
establishing a sensible public policy which specifies one of the two
protocols on a case-by-case basis. An app could allow the user to
provide either an antibody certificate or a health token depending
on the minimum necessary access rights of each particular service
provider.

RELATED WORK

Here we review the small number of alternative antibody certificate
schemes which have been proposed. To the best of our knowledge,
all alternative schemes are either based on a centralised architecture
or propose the use of a blockchain. Many of the commercial systems
being trialed and implemented by governments [7, 34] provide few
technical details and cannot be fully understood or reviewed.
In the centralised category Estonia’s antibody certificate system [7] enables people to share their so-called immunity status
with a third-party using a temporary QR-code that is generated
after authentication. Commercially, CoronaPass [6] also propose a
centralised antibody certificate solution where service providers
verify each user passport against a central database. Whilst security
and legal measures can be put in place, in both these solutions,
to deter the central authority from misusing the data they hold,
it nonetheless represents an avoidable risk and a central point of
failure. Involving the central party in each authentication risks
large-scale user tracking and feature creep.
Eisenstadt et al. [15] propose an antibody certificate scheme
in which W3C-standard “verifiable credentials” [37], the “Solid”
platform for decentralised social applications [27] and a federated
consortium blockchain are combined. In this system, a hash of
each user’s certificate is stored in a consortium blockchain which
is checked each time that an authentication between a user and
verifier takes place. Many commercial antibody certificate solutions

also indicate that a blockchain is included. The “Immupass Covid19 Immunity Certificate” [3] stores details of the tested individual
directly in a consortium blockchain. User’s present a QR code and
their passport to a verifier and the corresponding test result and its
validity is retrieved from the blockchain. CERTUS [1] uses a similar
approach as does Vottun who are partnering with PwC for a trial
in Spain [32].
In the broader security and privacy literature relating to COVID19, we note that there has been significant debate over the merits of
centralised versus decentralised systems for digital contact tracing
[2, 4, 9, 38]. This is a complex debate because there is a tradeoff
between privacy and utility. In particular, centralised contact tracing
data may be a valuable tool in tackling the virus. We do not think
this debate directly applies here because there is less utility in a
centralized record of when and where antibody certificates have
used. Consequently, we believe decentralisation is the best approach
for antibody certificates.
In relation to the societal implications of antibody certificates,
and our general principles which we present in Section 2, the Ada
Lovelace Institute published a “Rapid evidence report” [21] which
explores how non-clinical measures can be used to attempt to relax
current governmental controls and restrictions without an intolerable rise in COVID-19 cases. Finally, we comment that, as we have
discussed, the scientific evidence and public understanding of the
situation is fast changing, therefore we concur with Eisenstadt et
al. [15] who call for regular reviews and oversight of sch processes
to be handled by an Ethical Committee.

CONCLUSION

In this work we explore the controversial technique of antibody certificates and present SecureABC: a decentralised, privacy-preserving
system for issuing and verifying antibody certificates. This work
is a necessary and important first step towards enabling an open
discussion about the technical implications of antibody certificates.
We consider the implications of antibody certificate systems, develop a set of general principles and security requirements for their
deployment and show that these may be satisfied in practice.
Whilst the work here specifically considers antibody certificates
for COVID-19, our framework of security properties, implementation results and privacy-preserving protocols contribute more
generally to the development of any health certificate solution.
