Abstract—The COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic has affected
virtually every region of the globe. At the time of conducting
this study, the number of daily cases in the United States is
more than any other country, and the trend is increasing in
most of its states. Google trends provide public interest in various
topics during different periods. Analyzing these trends using data
mining methods might provide useful insights and observations
regarding the COVID-19 outbreak. The objective of this study
was to consider the predictive ability of different search terms
(i.e., bars and restaurants) with regards to the increase of daily
cases in the US. In particular, we were concerned with searches
for dine-in restaurants and bars. Data were obtained from Google
trends API and COVID tracking project. We considered the
causation of two different search query trends, namely restaurant
and bars, on daily positive cases in top-10 states/territories of
the United States with the highest and lowest daily new positive
cases. In addition, to measure the linear relation of different
trends, we used Pearson correlation. Our results showed for
states/territories with higher numbers of daily cases, the historical
trends in search queries related to bars and restaurants, which
mainly happened after re-opening, significantly affect the daily
new cases, on average. California, for example, had most searches
for restaurants on June 7th, 2020, which affected the number of
new cases within two weeks after the peak with the P-value of
.004 for Granger’s causality test. Although a limited number
of search queries were considered, Google search trends for
restaurants and bars showed a significant effect on daily new
cases for regions with higher numbers of daily new cases in the
United States. We showed that such influential search trends
could be used as additional information for prediction tasks in
new cases of each region. This prediction can help healthcare
leaders manage and control the impact of COVID-19 outbreaks
on society and be prepared for the outcomes.

I. INTRODUCTION
The entire world has been affected significantly by a global
virus pandemic. The first case of this virus was reported in
China during December 2019, and the first case outside China
was discovered in January 2020 [1]. During February, the
World Health Organization called this virus COVID-19 [2].
Worldwide, there have been 14.4M confirmed cases, with
604K deaths, as of 19th of July 2020 [3]. The United States of
America, with 3.83M confirmed cases and 143k deaths, is the
most affected country around the world. In some states, the
numbers are still increasing (e.g., California), while in some
other states such as New York, the peak has passed, and the
average daily new cases are decreasing.

Due to the rapid spreading of this virus, finding effective
reasons can play a significant role in prevention policies. Using
data mining and time series analysis methods, it is possible to
investigate the impact of different phenomena on time series
data. In economics, as an example, there are different studies
that model the temporal relationship of two or more time series
(e.g., the relationship between oil and gold price) using the
same methods [4].
Google search trends can be useful for reflecting public
interests/concerns during different periods [5]. During the
COVID-19 outbreak, different studies have investigated the
correlation of web-based data and cases of this virus. Kutlu et
al. [6] investigated the correlation of dermatological diseases
obtained by specific Google search trends with the COVID19 outbreak. In addition, Google trends have been utilized to
predict and monitor COVID-19 cases around the world [5], [7],
[8], [9], [10], [11]. Multiple studies analyzed the data related
to the US to correlate the search trends and COVID-19 cases
[12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17]. However, these studies did
not consider the predictive ability of search trends on future
confirmed cases.
In this paper, we considered the causality effect and predictive ability of search terms related to bars and restaurants
on the daily new cases of the US in different regions. Along
with the linear correlation analysis between search trends and
COVID-19 cases, we have utilized the statistical causality
methods to investigate the influential confidence of these
methods on COVID-19 daily new cases.
II. M ETHODS
A. Datasets
For our analysis, we obtained the daily cases of COVID19 in the US using the COVID tracker project [18]. This
project compiles the daily statistics, including the number
of positive/negative tests, hospitalization, available ventilators,
and the number of deaths from each US state and territory.
For this study, we considered the data of approximately three
months starting April 09, 2020, to July 07, 2020, which
contains 5040 samples for 56 states/territories.
We used Google Trends to obtain the public interest in bars
and restaurant categories with daily resolution. We used the
most popular query for each category from April 09, 2020, to
July 07, 2020, for 45 available regions in Google trends API.
For restaurants and bars, we chose “dine-in restaurants that
are open near me” and “bars near me”, respectively. Google
trend does not provide the number of queries per day. Instead,
it provides a normalized number between 0 and 100, where 0
refers to “low volume of data for the query” while 100 refers

to the “highest popularity for the term” [19]. To be consistent
with Google trend values, we normalized the US daily new
cases between 0 and 100 in our analysis.
Aggregating data from Google trends results and COVID-19
daily cases, and removing missing values, resulted in available
data for 45 regions in the US. We categorized our analysis to
two different groups: First, top-10 states/territories with the
highest number of daily new cases as of July 7th, 2020 which
consist of Texas (TX), Florida (FL), California (CA), Arizona
(AZ), Georgia (GA), Louisiana (LA), Tennessee (TN), North
Carolina (NC), Washington (WA) and Pennsylvania (PA). Second, top-10 states/territories with the lowest number of daily
new cases as of July 7th, 2020: Kansas (KS), Hawaii (HI), New
Hampshire (NH), Maine (ME), West Virginia (WV), Rhode
Island (RI), Connecticut (CT), Montana (MT), Nebraska (NE)
and Delaware (DE).
B. Correlation and Causation
To analyze the linear correlation of two time-series, the
Pearson correlation has been utilized. The value of such a
correlation ranges from -1 to 1, which shows a negative and
positive correlation, respectively. Our analysis measured the
Pearson correlation between the trends of search queries (i.e.,
restaurants and bars) and the daily new cases of COVID-19
in each state.
In addition, we used Granger’s causality [20] to model the
influence of a time series’ past values on the new values of
another time series. Granger’s causality tests whether the past
values of a time series X cause the current values of another
time series Y. Hence, in this study, the null hypothesis is
that X’s past values do not affect Y’s current values. If the
P-value is less than the marginal value (.05), we can reject
the null hypothesis. In our analysis, we reported P-values for
each aforementioned search query’s influence on the daily new
cases. One of the main assumptions of modeling the influence
of time series on each other is their stationarity. To test such
a characteristic, we used the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF)
test [21] as our unit root test. This test determines the effect
of a trend in the creation of the time series. In other words,
it determines how strongly a trend defines a time series. The
alternative hypothesis in the ADF test is the stationarity of the
time series.
In this study, since the time series were not stationary,
we applied first differencing on search trends and second
differencing on daily new cases to make all of the three
series stationary. For statistical analysis, we used the Python
Statsmodel package [22].
C. Vector Autoregression
In our study, we leveraged the fact that search trends might
impact the daily new cases in the future; hence a Vector
Autoregression (VAR) [23] model for each region was fitted
to the data. A VAR model takes into account the influence of
the past values of time series X and Y on current values of
time series Y with a given lag order. Lag order with the lowest
Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC) was picked in this study.

Fig. 1. The proposed model architecture.

Since symptoms may appear within 2-14 days after exposure
to the COVID-19 virus [24], a maximum of 14 lags was used.
The equation for the VAR model with two lags is summarized
below:
Yt = α + β1 Xt−1 + β2 Xt−2 + β10 Yt−1 + β20 Yt−2 + t
In this model, Yt represents the value of time series Y at time
t, which consists of a combination of previous lag values from
Y and X with different weights β, β 0 and random white noise,
t . We fitted a VAR model to perform Granger’s causality test.
D. Long Short-Term Memory
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) [25] models are a type
of recurrent neural network useful for time series prediction.
These models capture the long term effect of time series as
well as their most recent values. In this study, we utilized
LSTMs to predict the daily new cases using two sets of
features: 1) the historical values of the new cases time series
and 2) using additional information from searching query time
series. We used 70% of the data for training, and the rest
were used for evaluation of the model. Root mean square error
(RMSE) was selected as the performance metric. RMSE can
be calculated as follows:
r
1 X
(Ŷ − Y )2
RM SE =
N
In this equation, N is the number of samples, Ŷ is the
predicted value, and Y is the actual value of the time series.
The architecture of the used model is illustrated in Fig. 1.
It consists of 3 LSTM layers along with dropout layers, and a
fully connected layer at the end. Dropout layers were utilized
to avoid overfitting, which is a typical problem in Machine
Learning tasks. To train such a model, we used the TensorFlow
package of Python.
III. R ESULTS
Observation. Search trends and the daily new cases can be
different in each state/territory. Hence, the significance level
of influence of search-related time series on the current values
of daily new cases is different in each region. For the sake
of comparison, Fig. 2 illustrates the moving average trend of
“bar and restaurant” searches as well as the daily new cases
in California (CA) and Delaware (DE).
Fig. 2 shows for regions such as CA, there was a steep
rise of restaurant searches peaking on June 7th. The daily
new cases have a drastic increase within two weeks of such a

peak. Considering the bar searches in CA, the plot shows an
increasing trend with peak value on June 13th. However, in
DE, the daily new cases are not profoundly affected by such
search trends. One reason could be the lower population as it
is reflected in the number of daily new cases. The other reason
can be the high number of new daily cases in California at
the time of re-opening restaurants and bars (+2000).
Granger’s Causality Test. Due to the inclusion of a large
number of states/territories in our analysis (45), we picked top10 regions in the US with the highest and lowest daily new
cases as of July 7th, 2020. Table I summarizes the P-values
for testing the null hypothesis (the coefficients corresponding
to past values of the second time series are zero) for the first
group. P-values below .05 represents the rejection of the null
hypothesis, which shows the effect of searching queries on
daily new cases for each region.
Based on Table I, California has small P-values, which
shows the influence of the aforementioned search queries on
daily new cases; hence, they can be used to predict daily
new cases. Florida and North Carolina are two examples
of states that the effect of restaurants is rejected with the
Granger’s Causality Test; however, Louisiana clearly is affected by restaurant searches. Fig. 3 illustrates the moving
average of daily new cases and restaurant search trends for
these three states. Based on Fig. 3, the high P-value for Florida
is because of the first peak in the restaurant search, which
did not change the daily new cases trends. North Carolina
has an overall increasing trend, causing the effect of the
search to be marginal. However, Louisiana is influenced by
the sudden changes in restaurant search trends, which clearly
have affected the daily new cases.
Similarly, Table II summarizes the P-values for Granger’s
causality test for the second group (i.e., top-10 regions with
the lowest daily new cases).
Comparison between Tables I and II shows that regions with
higher daily cases are more affected by restaurant and bar
searches on average.

Pearson Correlation To show the linear relationship of time
series, the Pearson correlation is utilized. Tables III and IV
summarize these correlations with corresponding P-values for
each group. Based on these two tables, the linear correlation
between the search trends related to bars/restaurants and daily
new cases in regions with a higher number of daily cases is
more substantial, on average, compared to regions with lower
daily cases.
New Cases Prediction. We used LSTM models to predict
the value of daily new cases for a given region. We utilized
the search trend time series as additional information to adjust
the predicted values. The RMSE scores for test data for top-10
highest and lowest daily new cases are summarized in Tables

V and VI. These tables show the results for:
1) the baseline model which uses only the past values of
new cases time series for the prediction,
2) the model that uses the past values of restaurant searches
along with the past values of new cases time series,
3) and, finally, the model that combines the information
from the daily cases and bar searches time series.
Table V shows that regions with a significant causality
effect, the RMSE improves on average. CA is an example
of such an improvement.
Table VI shows for some states, although there is no causality effect for the restaurants, the value of RMSE improves. On
the other hand, for states like Montana (MT), which Granger’s
Causality Test shows a significant effect, the RMSE has been
increased. By investigating the time series for these two states
(Figs. 4 and 5), we can interpret such inconsistencies for two
reasons. First, for states such as Kansas (KS), the improved
value is because of the fluctuation in the new cases time
series, making the prediction unreliable. Second, as Figs. 4
and 5 show, the impulses in restaurant searches for KS and
MT are point impulses. These unit jumps cannot improve the
prediction of the time series, although they appear in causality
tests.
IV. DISCUSSION
A. Principal Results
To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first analysis
that considers the predictive ability of Google search trends,
namely restaurants and bars, on daily new cases of COVID-19
in the US. This study uses statistical methods to validate such
an effect on daily new cases.
Granger’s causality test shows that in some regions, the effect of restaurants on daily new cases is significant. California

is an example of such states. On May 18th, the governor of
California announced the easing of criteria for counties to reopen faster than the state, and on May 25th he announced plans
for the re-opening of in-store shopping [26]. Consequently,
there was an increase in restaurant searches, and the peak
of the searches happened on June 7th. The daily new cases
drastically increased within two weeks of the escalation in
dine-in restaurant searches.
Similarly, such a trend in bar searches happened in California (Fig. 2). Regardless of the seasonal effect of time series,
which shows a higher number of searches for bars during
weekends, the average trend in bar searches increased. However, North Carolina is not influenced by restaurant searches
(Table I). The reason is that this state has an increasing average
trend regardless of the other time series (Fig. 3). Therefore the
P-value for Granger’s causality is high (.53).
This study suggests that the effect of restaurant and bar
searches is higher in the regions with higher daily new cases
compared to the regions that have a lower number of positive
cases reporting every day. On average, in the regions with a
higher number of daily new cases, more significant Granger’s
casualties and higher values of Pearson correlation support this
fact.
We used artificial intelligence models to improve the prediction results of new cases using additional information, namely
Google trends. These Google trends for restaurants and bars
can be useful depending on the time series structure. Prediction
in time series uses the information of previous values (lags)
to estimate the current values.
B. Limitations
There are several limitations to this study. We only used
the most popular search queries suggested by Google for each

category. People use different search terms to find the information they are looking for. Moreover, we only considered
the effect of restaurants and bars on daily cases. The other
limitation of our study can be the limited number of samples
for each region (88 samples on average). This limitation affects
the prediction results to a certain degree.
V. CONCLUSION
In conclusion, we investigated the causality effect of search
queries related to restaurants and bars on daily new cases in
the US regions with high and low daily cases. We showed
that for most of the regions with a high number of daily new
cases, the effect of search queries on bars and restaurants is
higher; hence, they can be used as additional information for
prediction tasks.
