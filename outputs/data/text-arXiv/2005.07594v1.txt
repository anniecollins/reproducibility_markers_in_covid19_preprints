Abstract
The COVID-19 epidemic that emerged in Wuhan China at the end of 2019 hit Italy particularly

hard, yielding the implementation of strict national lockdown rules (Phase 1). There is now a

hot ongoing debate in Italy and abroad on what the best strategy is to restart a country to exit

a national lockdown (Phase 2). Previous studies have focused on modelling possible restarting
scenarios at the national level, overlooking the fact that Italy, as other nations around the

world, is divided in administrative regions who can independently oversee their own share of
the Italian National Health Service. In this study, we show that regionalism, and heterogeneity

between regions, is essential to understand the spread of the epidemic and, more importantly,

to design effective post Lock-Down strategies to control the disease. To achieve this, we model

Italy as a network of regions and parameterize the model of each region on real data spanning

almost two months from the initial outbreak. Using the model, we confirm the effectiveness at
the regional level of the national lockdown strategy implemented so far by the Italian
government to mitigate the spread of the disease and show its efficacy at the regional level.

We also propose that differentiated, albeit coordinated, regional interventions can be effective

in Phase 2 to restart the country and avoid future recurrence of the epidemic, while avoiding

saturation of the regional health systems and mitigating impact on costs. Our study and

methodology can be easily extended to other levels of granularity (provinces or counties in

the same region or states in other federal countries, etc.) to support policy- and decision-

makers.

Introduction

Regionalism is an integral part of the Italian constitution. Each of Italy’s twenty administrative

regions is independent on Health and oversees its own share of the Italian National Health
service. The regional presidents and their councils can independently take their own actions,

strengthening or, at times, weakening national containment rules. Previous studies have
modelled the spread of the epidemics and its evolution in the country at the national level1-5,

and some have looked at the effects of different types of containment and mitigation
strategies6-11. Limited work12-21 has taken into account the spatial dynamics of the epidemic

but, to the best of our knowledge, no previous paper in the literature has explicitly taken into
consideration the pseudo-federalist nature of the Italian Republic and its strong regional

2

heterogeneity when it comes to health matters, hospital capacity, economic costs of a
lockdown and the presence of inter-regional people’s flows.

In this study, we investigate the whole of the country as a network of regions, each modelled

with different parameters. The goal is to identify if and when measures taken by the Italian

government had an effect at both the national, but most importantly, at the regional level.
Also, we want to uncover the effects on the epidemic spread of regional heterogeneity and
inter-regional flows of people and use control theoretic tools to propose and assess
differentiated interventions at the regional level to reopen the country and avoid future
recurrent epidemic outbreaks.

As aggregate models of the COVID-19 epidemic cannot capture these effects, to carry out our

study we derived and parameterized from real data a network model of the epidemics in the

country (see Figure 1a), where each of the 20 regions is a node and links model both proximity

flows and long-distance transportation routes (ferries, train, planes). The model is first shown
to possess the right level of granularity and complexity to capture the crucial elements needed

to correctly predict and reproduce the available data. Then, it is used to design and test
differentiated feedback interventions at the regional level to alleviate the epidemic impact.

Using the model and an ad hoc algorithm to parameterize it from real data, we evaluate the

effectiveness of the national lockdown strategy implemented so far by the Italian government
providing evidence of its efficacy across regions. Also, we show that inter-regional fluxes must
be carefully controlled as they can have dramatic effects on recurrent epidemics waves. Finally,

we convincingly show that regional feedback interventions, where each of the twenty regions
strengthens or weakens local mitigating actions (social distancing, inflow/outflow control) as

a function of the saturation of their hospital capacity, can be beneficial in mitigating possible
outbreaks and in avoiding recurrent epidemic waves while reducing the costs of a nation-wide

lockdown.

Results
Regional effects of the national lock-down
Our approach successfully uncovers the regional effects of the national lock-down measures

set in place by the Italian government initially in two northern regions (Lombardy and Veneto

from the February 27th 2020), and then nationally from March 8th 2020 till May 4th 2020. We

observe that notable parameter changes, detected automatically by our parameterization
procedure (see Methods), occur as an effect of such measures with a certain degree of
homogeneity across all regions (see Figures S8, S9 and Table S4 in the Supplementary

Information showing the changes in the social distancing parameter 𝜌𝜌𝑖𝑖 over the period of

interest). This confirms the effectiveness across the country of the strict social distancing rules

implemented at the national level as also noted in previous work1,2,14 modeling the country as
a whole.

The representative examples of two regions, Lombardy in the North and Campania in the

South, highlighted in Figure 1, show that the model is able to correctly capture the effect of
such measures in both the regions, see Table 1. The model also captures the effect of the flow

of people that travelled from North to South when the national lockdown measures where first

announced on March 8th 2020. As shown in Table 1, the estimated number of infected
predicted by the model for the Campania region in the time window March 19th - March 30th

2020 is detected to suddenly increase at the beginning of the next time window. This can be

explained as a possible effect of the movement of people from North to South that occurred

around 15 days before. Also, the data analysis consistently shows across many regions that
the mortality rate changes dramatically as a function of the saturation of the hospital beds in

the region (see Figure S11 and Section S2 of the Supplementary Information for further
details).

Regional heterogeneity counts
After confirming the predictive and descriptive ability of the proposed model, we investigated

next the influence of regional heterogeneity on the onset of an epidemic outbreak and the

4

occurrence of possible recurrent epidemic waves. To this aim we set the model with
parameters capturing the situation in each region on May 3rd 2020, when the effects of the

national lock down were fully in place, and simulated the scenario where just one of the twenty
regions (e.g., Lombardy in the North of Italy) fully relaxes its lockdown. As reported in Figure

2, we found that a primary outbreak in that region would quickly propagate causing secondary

recurrent outbreaks in other regions including Emilia-Romagna and Piedmont. At the national

level this would cause the onset of a second epidemic wave that, if not contained, would end
up afflicting more than 25% of the entire population. An even more dramatic scenario would

emerge if inter-regional flows where concurrently restored to their pre-lockdown levels (see

Figure S1) or all regions were to relax their current restrictions concurrently (see Figure S2 in
the Supplementary information).

Feedback regional interventions can be beneficial
A crucial open problem is to support decision makers in determining what form of

interventions might be beneficial to avoid the onset of future outbreaks while mitigating the

cost of Draconian interventions at the national level. To this aim we compared the effects of

national measures (e.g., general lockdown) against those of a regional feedback strategy where
social distancing measures are put in place or relaxed independently by each region according

to the ratio between hospitalized individuals and the total capacity of the health system in that
region. In particular, we assume each region implements a stricter lockdown when such a ratio

becomes greater or equal than 20% and relaxes the social distancing rules when it is below

5% (see Methods for further details). Figure 3 confirms the effectiveness of such a local
strategy, where we see that a differentiated strategy among the regions is more effective than
a national lockdown in avoiding future waves of the disease (Figure S3) but, most importantly,

also in guaranteeing that no region exceeds its own hospitals’ capacity. Moreover, intermittent

regional measures yield lower economic costs for the country, as regional economies can be
restarted and remain open for a much longer time (Table 2 and Table S1); an effect that

becomes even more apparent when regions concurrently increase their testing capacity as

shown in Figure 4 and reported in Table 2.

Discussion
Following the initial COVID-19 outbreak in Northern Italy, the Italian government, as many

other governments around the world, adopted increasingly stricter lockdown measures at the

national level to mitigate the epidemic. Despite their success, their tolling economic costs have

stirred a hot national debate on whether such measures were necessary in the first place and
on how to relax them while avoiding future epidemic waves. Several attempts have been made
in the literature at addressing this pressing open issues by means of aggregate models

(originated from the classical SIR model) to describe the effects of different intervention

strategies at the national level6,7. A network model has also been recently proposed to describe
the spatial dynamics of the spread of the COVID-19 epidemics among the 107 Italian

provinces14. Other works in the literature have explored the effects of intermittent measures,

either periodic or as a function of some observable quantities, as a viable alternative to long,
continuous periods of national lockdown. However, the effects of these strategies have only
been investigated on theoretical aggregate models at the national level7,22.

An important missing aspect that we considered in our study is the effect of regional

heterogeneity on the efficacy of the measures taken so far and the possibility of adopting

differentiated and localized intervention strategies thanks to the pseudo-federalist
administrative structure of the Italian Republic. Our results confirm the effectiveness at the

regional level of the national lockdown measures taken so far. They also convincingly reveal

the presence of important regional effects due, for example, to the saturation of regional
healthcare systems or to the presence of notable North-South flows in the country that

followed the announcement of national measures. Also, contrary to previous work, we

explicitly accounted for the strongly nonlinear nature of the model and the uncertainty present
in the data by performing a sensitivity analysis on the estimated parameters that further

confirmed the robustness of the proposed strategies for a wide range of parameter changes

Our study strongly suggests for policy- and decision- makers the potential benefits of

differentiated (but coordinated) feedback regional interventions, which can be used
independently or in combination with other measures, in order to avoid future epidemic waves

or even to contain the outbreak of potential future epidemics. Despite having been focused

6

on Italy, our methodology and modeling approach can be easily extended to other levels of

granularity, e.g. countries in a continent or counties in a state, and adapted to any other nation

where regional heterogeneity is important and cannot be neglected; notable examples are
countries with a federal state organization such as Germany or the United States of America.

Future work needs to address further aspects as for example exploring how the structural
properties of the inter-regional network can influence the dynamics of the epidemic or
adopting more sophisticated cost functions to design more effective region-specific

mitigation strategies in other contexts or for other purposes.
Methods

Regional and national model

As a regional model of the COVID-19 epidemic spread we use the compartmental model
shown in Figure 4 which we found from data analysis and identification trials to be the simplest

model structure able to capture the real data. The full model equations describe the dynamics

of susceptible (𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖 ), infected (𝐼𝐼𝑖𝑖 ), quarantined (𝑄𝑄𝑖𝑖 ), hospitalized (𝐻𝐻𝑖𝑖 ), recovered (𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖 ) and deceased
(𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖 ) and are given as:

where 𝛽𝛽 is the infection rate which will be assumed to be the same for all regions since COVID19 is transmitted from person to person and there is no parasite vector or evidence of

environmental parameters significantly altering its infection rate, 𝜌𝜌𝑖𝑖 ∈ [0,1] is a parameter

modeling the effects of social distancing measures in the i -th region , 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 is the rate of infected
that are detected and quarantined, 𝜓𝜓𝑖𝑖 is the rate of infected that needs to be hospitalized, 𝛾𝛾

is the recovery rate of the infected that is assumed to be equal for all regions, 𝜂𝜂𝑖𝑖𝑄𝑄 is the rate of
quarantined who recover, 𝜂𝜂𝑖𝑖𝐻𝐻 is the fraction of hospitalized who recover, 𝜅𝜅𝑖𝑖 is the rate of
𝑄𝑄

hospitalized that is transferred to home isolation, 𝜅𝜅𝑖𝑖𝐻𝐻 is the rate of quarantined who need to
be hospitalized, and 𝜁𝜁𝑖𝑖 is the mortality rate that was shown from data analysis (see Section S3

of the Supplementary Information) to be a function of the ratio between 𝐻𝐻𝑖𝑖 and the maximum
number, say 𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖𝐻𝐻 , of patients that can be treated in ICU at the hospitals in i-th region . 𝑁𝑁𝑖𝑖 is the

actual population in the i-th region, i.e. the resident population without those removed
because quarantined, hospitalized, deceased or recovered.

Extending previous approaches for modelling Dengue fever in Brazil23, we obtain the national

network model of the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy as a network of twenty regions (see Figure

1a) interconnected by links modeling commuter flows and major transportation routes among
them.

where in addition to the parameters and states described above, we included the fluxes 𝜙𝜙𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 (𝑡𝑡)

between regions; 𝜙𝜙𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 (𝑡𝑡): ℝ → [0,1] denoting the ratio of people from region i interacting with
those in region j at time t, such that ∑𝑗𝑗 𝜙𝜙𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 (𝑡𝑡) = 1.

Model parameterization from real data and model validation

We divide the model parameterization into two stages. Firstly, we estimate from the available
data the parameters of each of the twenty regional models; then, we use publicly available
mobility data in Italy to estimate the fluxes among the regions.

We follow the current consensus in the literature on COVID-192 (see Table S5) by setting 𝛽𝛽 =

0.4 and 𝛾𝛾 = 1/14 for all regions. We make the ansatz that parameters remain constant over
time intervals 𝑇𝑇𝑘𝑘 but do not assume the duration of such intervals known a priori. Therefore,

we set the problem of estimating the parameters values and when they change in each region
(as a likely result of national containment measures). We start estimating parameters in a

region from the first date when the number of deceased and the number of recovered is
greater or equal than 10.

Noting that the available data for the COVID-19 epidemics, as collected by the Dipartimento

della Protezione Civile - Presidenza del Consiglio dei Ministri (the Italian Civil Protection

�𝑖𝑖 ),
Agency), includes for each region the daily numbers of quarantined (𝑄𝑄�𝑖𝑖 ), hospitalized (𝐻𝐻

�𝑖𝑖 ) and the recovered from those who were previously hospitalized or quarantined,
deceased (𝐷𝐷

say 𝑅𝑅�𝑖𝑖𝑂𝑂 , we discretize and rewrite model (1)-(6) for each region (i = 1,…,20) as (dropping the
subscripts to the parameters for notational convenience)

where measured quantities are denoted by a tilde and estimated state variables by a hat and

𝜏𝜏: = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝜓𝜓. Here, 𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖 = 𝑄𝑄𝑖𝑖 + 𝐻𝐻𝑖𝑖 + 𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖 + 𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖𝑂𝑂 represents the total number of cases detected in
region i as daily announced by the Protezione Civile.

We notice that, exploiting the available data, the predictor can be split into two parts so that
two different algorithms can then be used to estimate the parameters of each part. An ad hoc

identification algorithm estimates the parameters of the nonlinear part (Equations (14)-(16))

and automatically detects the breakpoints where notable parameter changes occur, while an

ordinary least squares method is then used to identify the parameters of for the linear one
(Equations (17)-(20)), as described in detail in Section S2 of the Supplementary Information.

Note that, as the actual number of infected is not known9,24, we include the number of infected

at the beginning of each time window as a parameter to be estimated by the algorithm used
for the nonlinear part.

The results of the identification process also show the presence of a statistically significant
correlation (p-value equal to 0.034) between the value of the mortality rate, parameter 𝜁𝜁𝑖𝑖 in
model (1)-(6), and the saturation of the regional health system represented by the ratio

between the number of hospitalized in that region (𝐻𝐻𝑖𝑖 ) and the total number of available
hospital beds (𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖𝐻𝐻 ) (See Supplementary Information Section S2 and Figure S11 for further
details and function estimation).

10

Validation is carried out by using the parameterized model to capture the available data for
each window showing an average quadratic error less than 10% over the entire dataset. The

parameters identified in each window can also be used to provide model predictions of future
trends of the epidemic diseases as discussed in Section S2 of the Supplementary Information.

Cost Estimation

We estimate the cost of each regional lockdown as the sum of the costs for social care and
the loss of added value. The costs for social care in each region were computed as the costs
for layoff support (``cassa integrazione in deroga’’), estimated by multiplying the number of

requests26 by 65% of the average regional monthly income27, together with the non-repayable-

loan of 600 € given to self-employed workers by the Italian Government during the national

lockdown28. The loss of added value per day was taken from the values estimated by SVIMEZ
(the Italian Association for the development of Industry in the South) in Table 3 of their online

report29. We then compute the daily costs of the lockdown and use it to estimate the total
costs of each of the simulated scenarios.

Data fitting and sensitivity analysis

All computational analyses and the fitting of data were performed using MATLAB and its
optimization toolbox. To account for the inherent uncertainty associated to the COVID-19

epidemic, each result reported in the manuscript is the output of 10,000 numerical simulations,

where we varied the values of the model parameters using the Latin Hypercube sampling

method25. Specifically, the regional parameters 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 , 𝜓𝜓𝑖𝑖 , 𝜅𝜅𝑖𝑖𝑄𝑄 , 𝜅𝜅𝑖𝑖𝐻𝐻 , 𝜂𝜂𝑖𝑖𝑄𝑄 , 𝜂𝜂𝑖𝑖𝐻𝐻 and the estimated

initial condition at May 3rd 2020 𝐼𝐼𝑓𝑓,𝑖𝑖 were varied considering a maximum variation of ±20%

from their nominal values (indicated in Table S4 of the Supplementary Information).

Implementation and design of national and regional feedback intervention strategies

We model the implementation of regional social distancing strategies by capturing their
effects as a variation of the social distancing parameters, 𝜌𝜌𝑖𝑖 in (7)-(8), in each region.

Specifically, we assume each region follows the feedback control rule:

11

𝜌𝜌𝑖𝑖 =

⎧𝜌𝜌𝑖𝑖 ,
⎪
⎨𝜌𝜌̅ ,
⎪ i
⎩

0.1𝐻𝐻𝑖𝑖
≥ 0.20
𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖𝐻𝐻
0.1𝐻𝐻𝑖𝑖
if
≤ 0.05
𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖𝐻𝐻
if

where 𝜌𝜌𝑖𝑖 is set equal to the minimum estimated value in that region during the national
lockdown (see Table S9) and 𝜌𝜌̅i increased as a worst case to min(1,3𝜌𝜌𝑖𝑖 ) so as to simulate the

effect of relaxing the lock-down measures in each region. (The case where 𝜌𝜌̅i is set to a lower
value equal to 1.5𝜌𝜌𝑖𝑖 is shown for the sake of comparison in Figure S5 and Figure S6 of the
Supplementary Information).

Also, when a region is shut down, we assume all fluxes in and out of that region are reduced
to 70% of their original values to better simulate the actual reduction in people’s movement

observed during the lockdown in Italy (for further details see SI).

National lockdown measures are modelled by setting all 𝜌𝜌𝑖𝑖 simultaneously to 𝜌𝜌𝑖𝑖 in all regions
and reducing all fluxes by 70% while national reopening of all regions by setting all 𝜌𝜌𝑖𝑖
simultaneously to 𝜌𝜌̅i and restoring interregional flows to their pre-lockdown level.

To model the increase in the COVID-19 testing capacity of each region the parameter 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 in
region i is multiplied by a factor 2.5 which corresponds to the average increase in the number
of tests carried out nationally since the COVID-19 outbreak first started.

Numerical simulations

All simulations were carried out in MATLAB with a discretization step of 1 day to match the
available data sampling interval. Initial conditions for regional compartments were set as

follows. Quarantined, Hospitalized, Deceased and Recovered are initially set to the datapoints
available for May 3rd 2020. The number of infected is set to the value 𝐼𝐼𝑓𝑓 estimated by our

procedure for that date while Susceptibles are initialized to the resident population form which
the other compartments are removed.

in the case where only one region (Lombardy in North Italy) relaxes its containment measures
at time 0, while interregional fluxes are set to the level they reached during the lockdown level.
(Regional dynamics when the fluxes between regions are set to their pre-lockdown level are
shown in Figure S1 of the Supplementary Information showing even more dramatic scenarios).
Panels of regions adopting a lockdown are shaded in red while those of regions relaxing social
containment measures are shaded in greed. Blue, magenta, red, green, and black solid lines
correspond to the fraction in the population of infected, quarantined, hospitalized, recovered,

over 10,000 simulations with parameters sampled using a Latin Hypercube technique (see
Methods) around their nominal values set as those estimated in the last time window for each
region as reported in Table S4 of the Supplementary Information. Shaded bands correspond
to twice the standard deviation. The black dashed line identifies the fraction of the population
that can be treated in ICU (𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖𝐻𝐻 /𝑁𝑁𝑖𝑖 ). The regions identified with a red label are those where the

S1. DATA ANALYSIS
Data on the evolution of the epidemic in Italy
Data on the evolution of the epidemic in Italy and in each of the 20 regions have been obtained
from the public databaseS7 of the Italian Civil Protection Agency (Protezione Civile). The
database provides daily updates for each region on the overall number of detected cases,
hospitalized, quarantined, and recovered. The data were pre-processed by filtering it with a
moving average filter of 3 days to reduce noisiness. Information on the number of beds
available in ICU in each region have been obtained from data reported in public
repositories.S8,S9
Interregional Fluxes estimation
We considered two types of inter-regional fluxes associated to
(i)

daily commuters traveling between neighboring regions;

(ii)

long distance travels covered by high-speed trains, planes, and large ferries.

To estimate commuters’ fluxes, as in previous workS6, we use the latest official country-wide
assessment of Italian mobility conducted by the Italian Institute of Statistic (ISTAT) in 2011.
Specifically,

we

use

the

origin-destination

matrix

available

at

https://www.istat.it/it/archivio/139381 describing, at the municipality level, the number of
people who declared themselves daily commuters for work or studying purposes. By
aggregating data on a regional basis, we obtained interregional commuters’ flows among
regions.
For longer distance routes covered by high-speed trains, planes and large ferries we
proceeded as follows.
#

S2. IDENTITICATION PROCEDURE
As explained in the main text, we assume that, for each region, the parameters of the model
remain constant over & time windows, but neither their number & nor their durations 6) , … , 6+
are assumed to be known a priori. Therefore, the identification procedure detects at the same

3

time the breakpoints 8) , … , 8+,) when notable parameters’ changes are detected and, within
each time-window, estimates their values that best capture the trend of the available data.
The model used to carry out the identification of regional or national parameters is to start
with the discretized version of the model of the epidemic spread in each area of interest given
by model (14)-(20) in the main text.
As also noted in other previous workS1-S4, identification of SIR and SIR-modified models is
highly non-convex and hence the optimization landscape is scattered with local minima that
must be avoided as not being admissible. To mitigate this problem, we identified from the
literature admissible intervals for the parameter values (see Table S5) and fixed from the
available evidence in the literatureS3 the parameters 9 = 0.4 and = = 1/14.
Altogether, the unknown parameters left to be estimated are [@(0), A, B, C, D- , D. , E . , E - , F] both
at the national and regional level.
As mentioned in the main text, the identification procedure is carried out in two stages by
considering equations (14)-(16) of the main text to estimate {B, @(0), A} and the window
breakpoints and equations (17)-(20) of the main text to estimate the remaining parameters.
The identification described next is repeated for each of the 20 regions and, for the sake of
completeness, to parameterize a national aggregate model.
Step 1: Online Identification of the estimation breakpoints and the parameters B, @(0), A in each time
window
We start by identifying the parameters’ vector J ∶= [@(0), A, B] exploiting equations (14)-(16)
of the main text and the time series of the number of cases LM collected for N/0/ consecutive days
starting from the day when 10 deceased and 10 recovered were first reported in the area of
interest. In particular, an ad hoc optimization algorithm (described below and implemented in

4

MATLAB) is used to find breakpoints 8" and the values of the parameters’ vector JO that
minimize the cumulative squared prediction error in each window, defined as
3!#$
2
PPQRJO, 8" , 8"1) S = TU LM (8, J) − LW R8, JOSU
3(3!

with j= 0, 1, 2, …, & − 1.
We use the following recursive procedure:
1. Set the initial time 84 as the first day in which the first 10 deaths and 10 recovered were
reported in the area (region or nation).
2. Assume the initial guess for the width of the window to be N = ⌈(2% + 1)/[⌉, where %
is the number of parameters to be identified and [ the number of measured variables.
3. Estimate the parameters over the entire window to obtain JO = argmin PPQRJO, 84 , 84 +
6
5

NS
4. Divide the window into two intervals and estimate the parameters over each
subsample obtaining the two estimates JO& = argmin PPQRJO& , 84 , 84 + ⌈N/2⌉S, and JO7 =
6%
5

argmin PPQRJO7 , 84 + ⌈N/2⌉, 84 + NS.
6&
5

5. Perform Chow statistical test

c=

(N − 2%)(d − (d& + d7 ))
∼ ℱ{9,;,29}
%(d& − d7 )

where
d = PPQRJO, 84 , 84 + NS
d& = PPQRJO& , 84 , 84 + ⌈N/2⌉S
d7 = PPQRJO7 , 84 + ⌈N/2⌉, 84 + NS
and perform the test with null hypothesis g4 : iJO) = JO2 j and critical %-value %∗ = 10,>
6.
a. If ℱ{9,;,29} (c) > %∗ , the null hypothesis cannot be rejected, and the parameters
are considered constant in the time-window T. Then, the length of the current
window is increased by setting N = N + 1, and steps 3, 4 and 5 are repeated.
b. If ℱ{9,;,29} (c) ≤ %∗ , the null hypothesis is rejected, and then the next
breakpoint 8) is selected as
8) = argmax ℱ{9,;,29} (c)
5

and the parameter set JO that minimizes PPQRJO, 84 , 8) S is selected as the set that best fits
the data over the window (84 , 8) ) whose duration is therefore 6) : = 8) − 84 .
7. If 8) = N/0/ the algorithm is stopped, otherwise starting from 8) steps 2-7 are repeated
to find the next breakpoint and the new set of parameters best estimating the data in
the next window until the end of the available datapoints.
Step 2: Offline refinement of the identification process
At the end of the process we will have the set of breakpoints 8" and the parameters set in each
of the windows (8" , 8"1) ) best fitting the data. As the number of windows can be large given
The variability in the available data, we refine the estimation results as follows to estimate the
minimal number of windows able to capture qualitatively the trend of the real data.
In particular, once the window breakpoints are obtained at the end of step 1, any two
consecutive windows of duration say 6" , 6"1) are merged into one larger window of size 6" +
6"1) if one of the two following conditions is verified:
a) The window size of the first window is less than 5 days.
b) The relative variation of the sum B + A as estimated in each of the two windows is less
than 5%, i.e.
(B + A)"1) − (B + A)"
≤ 0.05
(B + A)"
where j denotes the window to which the parameter estimates refers to.
If two windows are merged, then the parameters are estimated again on the entire merged
window and the procedure is iterated once more in case condition b) is still verified.
As a final refinement step, we heuristically explore the effect on the fitting of perturbing the
breakpoints within ±5 days from their estimated value. As a representative example, the
results of the fitting procedure for the national aggregate model are shown in Table S3 and
depicted in
Figure S9. The same procedure is repeated to parametrize each of the 20 regional models.
To provide a representative validation of our estimation approach, we report in Figure S10
the time evolution of the total number of detected cases at the national level predicted by the
6

model in each time window. It is possible to see that using just 30% of the datapoints (shown
in green) from all the available data (shown in red), the model predictions (solid blue lines)
fit well the rest of the data in each time window both before and after the windows are merged
as a result of step 2 with a maximum prediction error of 10000 units.
Step 3: Identifying the parameters D. , D- , o, C, E . , E - , F
For each of the time windows identified in Step 2, using the time series @W(8) estimated from
the equations parametrized in Step 1, and considering that equations (17)-(20) of the predictor
reported in the main text are linear with respect to the parameters, we use a ordinary
constrained least squares method, with constraints given in
Table S2 to compute the remaining parameters.
The comparison between the model predictions and the available data is depicted in
Figure S11 and
Figure S12. Values of all estimated parameters at the end of the process are given in
Table S4 [Model parameters]. Values of estimated parameters for each region at the end of the
identification process. Dates are given corresponding to breakpoints between estimation
windows that are automatically detected by the estimation procedure we proposed. for each
region. In the last column the regional net reproduction numbers are computed as p4,! =
A! 9/(C! + o! + =) in each time window. Figure S13 shows the distribution of the regional
social distancing parameters over time showing the effects of the national lockdown at the
regional level.
F! as a function of the occupancy of ICU beds in each region
Observing the data and the identified parameters in
Table S4, we noticed a significant correlation between the mortality rate in each time window
and the congestion of the ICU system in that region.
Specifically, we found that
q! ) = F4?@ + F)?@ g
q!
F! = -(g
q! is the estimated average congestion
where F4?@ and F)?@ are coefficients to be estimated, while g
of the hospitals in each time-window defined as the ratio between the number of hospitalized
people and the number of available beds in ICU in that region, say N!. (available from the

7

web-page of the Italian Ministry of HealthS8 and updated daily from the news published by
the main Italian newspapers in each region).
Each point in Figure S14 is the value F! estimated for each region in each time window against
the number of hospitalized in the corresponding region averaged in the time window. As
illustrated in Figure S14, a least square linear fitting yields F4?@ = 0.016, F)?@ = 0.0013.

S3. REGIONAL FEEDBACK INTERVENTION STRATEGIES
We considered three different types of intervention strategies at the regional level that can be
used individually or in combination.
1) Feedback Social distancing rule. Each region modulates its lockdown measures so as to
switch them on or off according to the relative saturation level of its health system.
Namely, the social distancing parameter is modulated as follows:

A! =

⎧A! ,
⎪
⎨
⎪ A̅! ,
⎩

x!
g
≥ 0.5
N!.
x!
g
(- . ≤ 0.2
N!

(-

where A! is set equal to the minimum estimated value in that region during the
national lockdown (corresponding to the value given in the last window for each
region reported in Tab. S4) and, as a worst case scenario, A̅! is set to three times A! (or
unity if 3A! >1) to simulate a relaxation of the containment measures in that region.
2) Feedback flux control. Here the fluxes in or out of a region are modulated according to
the following rule
A"
.

!!" , (!!" = {
!|!" , (-

;"'
A"
.

!"! , (!"! = {
!|"! , (-

;"'
A"
.

;"'

≥ 0.5
≤ 0.2

, ∀" ≠ (

and
A"
.

;"'

≥ 0.5
≤ 0.2

, ∀" ≠ (

where we denote by !!" and !|!" respectively the quarantine (low) and post quarantine
(high) values of the flux from region ( to region ". In particular during a lockdown we
set !!" = 0.7!|!" while !|!" correspond to the fluxes from region i to region j estimated
as described in Sec. S.2.
Note that all people resident in ( not commuting to any other region are assumed to
stay and move in region ( itself by setting !!! = 1 − ∑"B! !!" .

S4. FURTHER DETAILS ON THE NUMERICAL CODE
All the numerical analyses presented in the paper were performed with Matlab. The code is
available at https://github.com/diBernardoGroup/Network-model-of-the-COVID-19 and was
designed to
1) Load the estimated parameter values and the inter-regional fluxes and to iterate the
discretized model dynamics of each region considering the presence of interregional
fluxes (MATLAB script “siqhrd_network_main.m”). The script also computes the
regional and national net reproduction numbers.
2) Implement the differentiated regional intervention strategies described in Section S4.
3) Carry out parameter sensitivity analysis by using the Latin Hypercube sampling to
explore the parameter region surrounding the estimated nominal parameter values. A
variation of up to 20% of all parameters was considered in the simulations reported in
the

paper

(Matlab

scripts

“siqrhd_network_main_montecarlo.m”

and

“hypercube_gen.m”)
Further details can be found in the accompanying README.TXT file included with the code
in the software repository above.

Description
Continuity constraint on the number of infected at the
national level from window j to window j+1.
Continuity constraint on the number of infected at the
regional level. The constraints are relaxed by 10% of the
national estimated infected to account for the fact that in
estimating the region parameter we are neglecting the
influx of infected from other regions.
We assume that the daily number of people hospitalized
from quarantine and discharged but still positive (and
vice versa) is no higher than 10% of the total.
We assume B̂! = Câ! + oO! does not differ from the national
estimate B̂ of more than 30%.
We assume the recovery rate of those quarantined at
home remains the same from a time window to the next
as this parameter is likely to be time-invariant. In any
case, removing this constraint, we observed no
significant change of this parameter from a time window
to the next.

Table S4 [Model parameters]. Values of estimated parameters for each region at the end of
the identification process. Dates are given corresponding to breakpoints between estimation
windows that are automatically detected by the estimation procedure we proposed.
Regional net reproduction number are reported in the last column clearly showing the
increasing effect of the national lockdown measures taken by the government on March 8th
2020. The parameter values used to simulate the exit from the Lock-Down considered in this
paper are those shaded in grey for each region corresponding to the estimated parameter in
the last window ending on May 3rd 2020.

Table S5 [Comparison with the parameters estimated in other papers in the literature for the national aggregate models]. Comparison between
the parameter’s values we used in our work and those used in other papers proposing national models for the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy that
recently appeared in the literature. Notice that, unfortunately, often it is not possible to pin down a specific parameter in a different model that
clearly corresponds to one of ours, and vice-versa. This is because of the different meaning that compartments have in the models and the
dynamics of people between the compartments which do not always overlap in an unambiguous manner. When we had to use a time constant,
say τ, to determine the value of a parameter, say k, that describes the rate of change form compartment A to B, we proceeded as follows. We set
k = p / τ, where p ∈ [0, 1] is the percentage of people that has been estimated to actually move from compartment A to B.
