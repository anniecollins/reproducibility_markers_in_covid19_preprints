Abstract
The control of Covid 19 epidemics by public health policy in Italy during the first and the second
epidemic waves has been driven by using reproductive number Rt(t) to identify the supercritical
(percolative), the subcritical (arrested), separated by the critical regime. Here we show that to
quantify the Covid-19 spreading rate with containment measures (CSRwCM) there is a need of a
3D expanded parameter space phase diagram built by the combination of Rt(t) and doubling time
Td(t). In this space we identify the dynamics of the Covid-19 dynamics Italy and its administrative
Regions. The supercritical regime is mathematically characterized by i) the power law of Td vs.
[Rt(t)-1] and ii) the exponential behaviour of Td vs. time, either in the first and in the second wave.
The novel 3D phase diagram shows clearly metastable states appearing before and after the second
wave critical regime. for loosening quarantine and tracing of actives cases. The metastable states are
precursors of the abrupt onset of a next nascent wave supercritical regime. This dynamic description
allows epidemics predictions needed by policymakers to activate non-pharmaceutical interventions
(NPIs), a key issue for avoiding economical losses, reduce fatalities and avoid new virus variant
during vaccination campaign.
1. Introduction
While the laws of uncontrolled epidemics spreading in a single network are well known1 the
quantitative description of the epidemics dynamics in multilayer heterogeneous networks2 with
containment measures is a strategic hot topic for statistical physics of living matter3-10 to face
Covid-19 pandemia showing non-uniform space population density and short time time
heterogeneity,11-15 which give a epidemic dynamics characterized by multiple waves where
supercritical phases are intercalated by metastable states in plateaus due to intermittent weakening

1

of the lockdown, quarantine and tracing rules in country enforcing the Lockdown Stop and Go
(LSG) policy.16-19
In the second year of Covid-19 epidemic spreading it is mandatory both to avoid the onset of the
third wave and to support an efficient vaccine immunization strategy. The non-medical containment
measures need to be addressed to reduce the number of infected cases to minimize the probability of
lethal virus mutations in the huge number of infected cell fission processes and to reduce the
fatalities number, before the immunization with vaccines is obtained. In Italy, at the end of the
second 2020 Covid epidemic wave while several researches have analysed short-time intervals of
the epidemic spreading,19-24 there is a lack of information on the dynamics of the full-time window
of the first and the second Covid-19 waves. In the time evolution of the Covid-19 spreading rate
with containment measures (CSRwCM) three main regimes have been clearly identified in ref 15:
the supercritical, critical, and the subcritical regime. In the supercritical phase the extrinsic effects
control the characteristic time s in the exponential law of the time-dependent doubling time
Td(t)=Ae(t-t0)/s

(1)

moreover, we have verified here that this phase is characterized by the power law function
Td(t)=C(Rt(t)-1)-ν

(2)

of the variable doubling time Td(t) vs. the reproductive number Rt(t). In this supercritical regime,
the cumulative curve of the total number of cases of the epidemics, approaches the critical regime,
following the complex Ostwald growth law,23,24 which is a mixed exponential and power-law
behavior determined by nucleation and growth of different phases in out of equilibrium complex
multiphase systems.25,26
We have verified the physical laws of the time evolution of the CEwCM using the new 3D
expanded parameter space Td(t, Rt) to describe the time evolution of the two Covid-19 epidemic
waves, mandatory to face the onset of the third wave. In addition, we introduce here the new
parameter RTD that takes into account both Rt(t) and Td(t). In this 3D expanded parameter space,
arrested metastable phases, with Rt>1 and Td(t)>40 days in the subcritical and critical regime, are
precursors of the possible onset of the supercritical regime of the third wave. In this work we

2

identify and show the metastable states precursors observed in Italy at the end of the second wave in
2021. Nowadays, these states are well identified and we expect that the situation may rapidly
evolve, depending on the enforced containment policy rules, toward either a third wave in the
supercritical regime or in the arrested subcritical regime. The results provide a quantitative
evaluation of the Covid-19 evolution trough different phases resulting from different containment
policies. The method gives us the possibility to foresee the evolution of the pandemic, and through
the identification of metastable states in the critical regime, help policymakers to avoid the
occurrence of new pandemic waves.
2. Results and Discussion
Data for each country have been taken from the recognized public database OurWorldInData27. We
have initially extracted the time-dependent doubling time Td(t) from the curve of total infected
cases, Z(t), and, after, the time-dependent reproductive number Rt(t) from the curve of active
infected cases, X(t), using the methodological definition provided by the Koch Institute28 in
Germany, as described in ref. 15. In a previous work15 we have verified the results of this approach
by using the inverted SIR theory where the effective reproductive number Re(t) and Td(t) have been
extracted from joint Z(t) and X(t) curves.
2.1 Metastable phases and dynamics of the second wave in Italy and Germany
Figure 1 shows the 3D phase diagram (Td, Rt, t) of the epidemic spreading in Italy and Germany
from 1st January 2020. The grey strip corresponds to the critical regime occurring above the
supercritical area for Td(t) between 40 and 100 days. Here we can easily visualize the supercritical
exponential growth, described by (1), of both the 1st and 2nd wave [Fig. 1a and Fig. 1b] that follow
the linear behavior in the semi-logarithmic plot of Td versus Rt and Rt-1 [see dashed arrows]. The
rate of the growth described by the s-factor is different due to the different policy containment
measure enforced during the two waves. Above the critical region, Td becomes large enough
(Td>100) and the exponential growth is arrested. In this arrested subcritical phase Rt becomes < 1,
as can be seen in the semi-logarithmic projection (Td, Rt-1) in Fig. 1b where values Rt<1 are not
showed. After the arrested phase, if Td decreases and Rt increases, new states appear in the region
with Rt >1 and Td around 100 over the critical phase. They give rise to a phase, metastable,

3

intermediate between the arrested phase and the occurrence of a new pandemic wave. In this
transition regime (orange full circle) present in both Fig. 1a and Fig. 1b, Td and Rt fluctuate
randomly around constant values for a finite time period. Indeed, in contrast with the 1st and 2nd
wave, obeying to the analytical law (2) in the supercritical region, in the metastable phase an
incoherent disordered behavior emerges. This is evident in the (Td, Rt) and (Td, Rt-1) projections in
Fig. 1c and Fig. 1d, respectively. In panel (d) the dashed line represents the power law best fit of the
supercritical regime dataset. The behavior is described in Fig. 1e by showing the 3D plot (Td, Rt, t)
where the doubling time Td(t, Rt) is plotted vs. days and the effective reproductive number Rt for
Italy (blue) and Germany (red). Here the metastable phases are followed by the falling in the
supercritical regime that marks the raise of the 2nd pandemic wave (dashed arrow). The same
mechanism is described by the (Td, Rt-1, t) phase diagram of Fig. 1f.
2.2 Metastable phases in the plateaus before and after the second wave in Italy and Italian regions
The Covid-19 spreading rate with containment measures (CSRwCM) in a heterogeneous population
can be understood in more detail looking at the analysis and the comparison of the pandemic
spreading rate in the different Italian regions. Figure 2 shows the 3D (Td, Rt, t) phase diagram for
three sets of Italian regions where different metastable phases can be recognized. We have
combined Emilia Romagna, Toscana and Lazio (left panels), Lombardia, Veneto, and Liguria
(central panels), Campania, Puglia and Sicilia (right panels). The semi-logarithmic projection (Td, t)
for these groups of regions are shown in Fig 2a, Fig 2b and Fig 2c. Again, in the supercritical
regime, 1st and 2nd waves obey the exponential growth of the Eq. 1 as indicated by dashed arrows.
Since the growth rate is described by the s-factor, we point out that in the 1st wave the exponential
epidemics growth is the same for all regions. On the contrary, the 2nd wave exhibit different growth
rate, as indicated by the dashed arrows, and are characterized by different s-factors and different
slopes. This is due by the different containment measures enforced by the local governments.
The orange areas identify the disordered metastable phases above the critical regime (grey
rectangle) with the precursor states of the 2nd phase. Fig 2d, Fig 2e and Fig 2f are the (Td, Rt)
projections confirming the universality of the scaling law in Eq. 2 in the supercritical phase, in all
regions. Also in this case, above the critical phase we identify arrested and metastable disordered

4

phases. Finally, Fig 2g, Fig 2h and Fig 2i show the (Td, Rt, t) 3D plot for the three sets of Italian
regions and the different metastable phases, all ending down the raising point of the 2nd wave.
The time dependence of Td and Rt values in nine selected Italian regions is compared in Figure 3. In
the supercritical regime (yellow areas) we can distinguish both the first and the second pandemic
wave where the doubling time (blue curve) increases in the range 2<Td<40 days and the
reproductive number Rt decreases down to 1. We omitted data of arrested phases, where Td and Rt
fluctuate around their maximum and minimum values, respectively. The green area identifies the
metastable phases from where the epidemic spreading can evolve towards a new epidemic wave or
towards an arrested phase if an effective containment policy is enforced.
2.3 The RTD factor to monitor the pandemic dynamics
In order to take into account both Rt and Td to describe the pandemic complex dynamics, we
introduce for the first time the new parameter
RTD = Rt(100/Td)

(3)

Figure 4 shows the RTD parameter as a function of time for nine selected Italian regions. Using this
parameter, the pandemic waves occur when RTD>1 (yellow areas). The green area with RTD<1
represents the arrested phase where Rt<1 and Td>100. We can also distinguish the metastable
phases: the first is precursor of the second pandemic wave while the second is in full swing. In these
phases, RTD fluctuates around 1 for a finite time. In the different phases the number of active cases
increases during the pandemic waves and decreases in the arrested phase. In the metastable phases
RTD exhibits a slightly flat behavior around the value of one.
In Figure 5 we compare maps of the Italian regions and the RTD values for different days selected
in different phases. When RTD >1 the system enters the critical regime. The color evolution from
yellow to red corresponds to Td and Rt values while spreading the pandemic. In particular, we can
visualize when in each region RTD approaches the critical regime (red colour), and thus when a
prompt intervention of policymakers and institutions is mandatory. Indeed, any delayed decision
may affect directly both the duration of the pandemic and the number of fatalities.

3. Conclusions
We have provided here an original quantitative approach to describe and understand the time
evolution of the Covid-19 pandemic, characterizing in a quantitative way the evolution stages. We
show that it is necessary to expand the parameter space, combining relevant variables like Td, Rt in
the new parameter RTD = Rt(100/Td), to precisely monitor the evolution of the pandemic. This
approach makes possible to analyse the dynamics, probing and tuning at the same time containment
measures. RTD sheds light and provides a new quantitative experimental tool not only for the
quantitative statistical physics of the Covid-19 pandemic, but thanks to its predicting power also for
any future epidemic events. Our results, showing the presence of a metastable plateaus at the end of
the second wave, support the recent evidence14 that susceptible population and dynamic
heterogeneity over multiple timescales of individual variations in social activity induces in the
epidemic dynamics the succession of epidemics waves separated by metastable states of transient
collective immunity (TCI), which is a fragile state that abruptly turns to the supercritical regime of
the third wave following short timescales super-spreading events, associated with loosing
containment rules in the LSG policy.
The Italian policy of Covid-19 containment measures in 2021 has followed the Imperial College
protocol called Lockdown Stop and Go (LSG) with keeping the period "Go" as long as the number
of available beds in Intensive care units of hospitals was below saturation, followed by "Stop"
periods. On the contrary, in many other countries, e.g., in the pacific-asian region, the Lockdown
case Finding mobile Tracing (LFT) policy has been enforced using a strict Quarantine,
characterized by mandatory mobile contact tracing with rollout of mass testing. The policy was to
reduce the number of infections below the tens per million populations with a different target called
"Zero infections". The comparative evaluation of the LSG versus LFT protocols can be summarized
by the positive economic trend observed in LFT countries (e.g. South Korea or China)23,29-33 and the
negative economic trend in LSG countries like Italy. The economic losses have been due to the long
stop of manufacture activities in LSG countries during the supercritical regime periods. In these
countries lockdown has been applied without mandatory contact tracing and loose quarantine during
the first and second wave. On the contrary in LFT countries the supercritical regime time periods
have been a factor three time shorter with a much less impact on the PIL.

6

The economic losses follow the number of fatalities per million populations, which are more than a
factor 100 in LSG versus LFT countries23,29-33. The current high number of daily fatalities per day in
the metastable regime near criticality and the shortage of vaccines require the urgent adoption of a
new plan taking into account the evolution of the pandemic, which occurs above all in the active
population. It is therefore mandatory to act looking at the "Zero infections" target by enforcing strict
contact tracing23,29-33 and quarantine rules, by stopping the emergence of new virus variants in the
near zero infections regime during the long vaccination campaign of the entire population. This new
policy will to speed up economy like in the Pacific Asian area and will reduce the still large number
of daily fatalities per million populations. The rapid detection of any possible onset of the third
wave by looking at the RTD parameter evolution will allow the prompt political response avoiding
the new lockdowns predicted in the LSG strategy. The use of the RTD parameter in the containment
policy will provide early warning to critical situations slowing down the rate of diffusion of the
virus during the vaccination campaigns, in particular for the scarce resources of vaccines and the
appearance of new virus variants, saving economic losses and reducing the number of fatalities.

(a) Semi-logarithmic (Td, t) projection of the 3D Phase Diagram (Td, Rt, t). Is evident the supercritical
exponential growth Td(t)=Aet/s [dashed arrows] in the 1st and 2nd wave. The exponential growth is arrested
above the critical phase (grey area) where Td >100 and Rt becomes < 1 [green circles]. This is also seen in
the semi-logarithmic projection (Td, Rt-1) in panel (b) where values Rt<1 are cancelled. After the arrested
phase, if Td growths and Rt increases a second pandemic phase occurs. The precursors of the new phase are
observed in the region with Td>100, over the critical phase, and Rt >1. This area is the orange circle in panel
(a) and (b). In the supercritical region both the 1st and 2nd wave obey to the same mathematical law
[Td(t)=C(Rt(t)-1)-ν] as shown in the (Td, Rt) and (Td, Rt-1) projections in panel (c) and (d), respectively. In
panel (d) the dashed line represents the power law best fit of data in the supercritical regime. The critical
phase [40<Td<100 days] is outlined by the horizontal grey dashed strip. Above the critical regime [Td>100
days and Rt<1] an incoherent disordered behavior is observed. (e) The (Td, Rt, t) 3D phase diagram for Italy

supercritical phase [Td<40 days; Rt>1] from the arrested subcritical phase [Td>100 days; Rt<1]. We indicate
here the metastable phase followed by the fall in the supercritical regime and the raising of the 2nd pandemic

The (Td, Rt, t) 3D phase diagram for several Italian regions. The planar semi-logarithmic projection (Td, t) for
three different groups of regions are shown in panel (a), (b) and (c). The 1st and 2nd waves obeying the
exponential growth [Td(t)=Aet/s] are outlined by dashed arrows in the supercritical regime. Since the growth
rate is described by the s-factor, in the 1st wave the exponential epidemics growth is the same for all regions.
On the contrary, the 2nd wave exhibits different growth rate due to the different s-factor [dashed arrows],
with different slopes. The orange areas outline the disordered metastable phases above the critical regime
(grey rectangle) and the precursors of the 2nd phase. The panels (d), (e) and (f) are the (Td, Rt) projections
showing the universality of the scaling law Td(t)=C(Rt(t)-1)-ν in the supercritical phase in all regions. Also in
this case we observe the arrested and metastable disordered phases above the critical phase. Finally, in panels

different metastable phases all ending around the raising point of the 2nd wave.

data of the arrested phases, where Td and Rt fluctuate around maximum and minimum values, respectively.
The green area identifies the metastable phases from where the epidemic spreading may evolve towards an
arrested phase or a new epidemic wave.

while the second metastable phase is in full swing. In these phases, RTD fluctuates around 1 for a finite time.
