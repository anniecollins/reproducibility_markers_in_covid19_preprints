Abstract
The coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, was
declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in February 2020.
Currently, there are no vaccines or treatments that have been approved after clinical
trials. Social distancing measures, including travel bans, school closure, and
quarantine applied to countries or regions are being used to limit the spread of the
disease, and the demand on the healthcare infrastructure. The seclusion of groups
and individuals has led to limited access to accurate information. To update the
public, especially in South Africa, announcements are made by the minister of
health daily. These announcements narrate the confirmed COVID-19 cases and
include the age, gender, and travel history of people who have tested positive for
the disease. Additionally, the South African National Institute for Communicable
Diseases updates a daily infographic summarising the number of tests performed,
confirmed cases, mortality rate, and the regions affected. However, the age of
the patient and other nuanced data regarding the transmission is only shared in
the daily announcements and not on the updated infographic. To disseminate this
information, the Data Science for Social Impact research group at the University of
Pretoria, South Africa, has worked on curating and applying publicly available data
in a way that is computer readable so that information can be shared to the public
- using both a data repository and a dashboard.. Through collaborative practices,
a variety of challenges related to publicly available data in South Africa came
to the fore. These include shortcomings in the accessibility, integrity, and data
management practices between governmental departments and the South African
public. In this paper, solutions to these problems will be shared by using a publicly
available data repository and dashboard as a case study.

Introduction

Accurate data are at the centre of mitigating risk, preventing widespread panic and sensationalism
during a natural disaster. Evidence-based information obtained from accurate data is an asset, and
one of the only strategic resources the public have during a crisis. The practice of sharing information
to the public about the current state of things is dependent on specific data that has to be captured
and shared to the public in a way that is useful, usable and desirable. During a crisis, the public
needs to minimize exposure to the situation or act accordingly to provide support where needed. The
contribution of this paper is a framework that substantiates the type of data employed to capture
and modify shared information with the public during a crisis of a biological nature, such as the
COVID-19 pandemic. This paper summarises findings (e.g., demography and neighbourhood) based
Preprint. Under review.

on the public data repository [6] and dashboard1 , to support general understanding and lessons learned
from the COVID-19 epidemic.
The disease, COVID-19, is a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by the SARS-CoV-2
virus [1]. The first reported case of COVID-19 was in December 2019 in Wuhan, China [? ]. The
problem with SARS-CoV-2 is the pressure it puts on the healthcare system because of its high
infection rate [13]. Globally, sudden spikes in the confirmed COVID-19 cases are severe because
there are limited resources to effectively manage and treat patients in any of the current healthcare
systems [3]. As of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared SARS-CoV-2 a
pandemic- one of the first biological threats to modern society in the 21st century.[11]. In order for
the South African government to reduce the widespread of SARS-CoV-2, travelling restrictions were
placed on high-risk regions and border-crossings were closed from one country to another. South
Africa experienced the first COVID-19 case on the 28th of February 2020, and as of the 25th of
March 2020, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases increased to 702, despite efforts to contain
the virus by putting a ban on international travel [10]. The increase in confirmed cases may cause
widespread panic and anxiety, which is why the public relies on good, reliable information and data,
now more than ever.
Currently, information regarding the COVID-19 outbreak in South Africa is shared with the public
across various platforms, of which two are most popular/most widely used. Firstly, the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) publishes an infographic that contains limited information,
providing a bird’s-eye view of the outbreak. This information is limited to South Africa and only
reports the number of tests performed, number of confirmed cases, which regions are affected, and
COVID-19 related mortality [9]. Secondly, the minister of the Department of Health (DoH) in South
Africa, Zwelini Mkhize, updates the public regarding the cases as they arise on a daily basis. These
updates are published sentences on the DoH website, containing some demographic information about
the confirmed cases, including age, gender, travel history and mode of contraction of SARS-CoV-2
[2]. Although these sources of information are valuable, they are potentially ineffective ways of
sharing information to the public regarding their usability for a variety of reasons. Amongst these is
the number of different platforms a person has to navigate through to gain access to accurate data.
Additionally, the format in which the data are presented is not in a computer readable format and has
to undergo processing in order to be used and stored. This further complicates legibility, simplicity
and accessibility of the information that is shared, a concern about South African government data that
was highlighted in prior work [8]. The impact of not having useful, usable and desirable information
has a direct effect on management strategies and responses from the public in relation to the disease
[4].
To counter the aforementioned problem, the Data Science for Social Impact (DSFSI) research group
at the University of Pretoria, South Africa, has developed an open repository for the data integrity of
South African COVID-19 cases. DSFSI Lab members and willing volunteers are responsible for the
mining, validation and storage of data related to the COVID-19 patients in South Africa. To work
collectively on a project related to public data in a way that can be scaled, the DSFSI manages and
consolidates the available data related to the COVID-19 cases in South Africa. Once consolidated,
the data are shared in an open, publicly available repository on GitHub.com, and then linked to the
dashboard [7]. On the repository, any member or user has the freedom to critique and propose new
features or data to be added to the repository or dashboard. This includes data integrity issues as well
as information to be added to the repository that is otherwise outdated or virtually inaccessible to the
public. The workflow of this process is illustrated in Fig. 1.
In order to link information to the COVID-19 records, data needs to be accurate and restructured.
Unfortunately, when data are not updated and information changes about the state of the evidence,
then it becomes difficult to track when the changes occurred, especially if the changes relate to the
unique ID or name of the item. One such example relates to the publicly available South African
hospital data. Some items in the hospital data were last updated more than two years prior to 2020.
This includes hospital data such as coordinates, accurate contact information, and facilities available
within the hospital, as well as the population size of a/the district.
Most of the aforementioned information is not consolidated in one place a great risk factor in a time
where the public needs to know where to seek care, and which hospitals are equipped to test and
manage COVID-19 patients. Another example came about in a sudden spike of confirmed cases

Figure 1: Data publishing cycle of COVID-19 data
between the 23rd and 25th of March 2020. This increase of 435 cases came unaccompanied by any
of the aforementioned demographic information, transmission type, nor their travel history, and these
results are still pending. In subsequent days, there has been the same challenge, although the latest
available data on deaths has demographic information and some travel history.

Aims and Methodology

The primary objectives of this study were to determine what data should be included in a public
repository amidst the COVID-19 outbreak and how this data should be disseminated within a public
dashboard. The public repository of data followed a Creative Commons licence for data, and MIT
License for Code, with copyright for the Data Science for Social Impact research group at the
University of Pretoria, South Africa [5]. All of the data were gathered and consolidated on the public
repository which is hosted on GitHub2 and uploaded on Zenodo [6].
To determine if the dashboard (Fig. 2) and data repository were used, data and analytics were
performed on the basis of descriptive statistics related to the number of views, clicks, comments and
recommendations on the public repository and dashboard. The use of the repository goes further than
just the views, but that other researchers actually use it for analysis.

At least 404 unique visitors viewed the issues that were posted on the repository. A further 150
unique visitors viewed the pull requests. These were requests for data that members of the DSFSI
and the public contributed to the actual datasets. To manage the issues that were posted, ten different
labels were created to categorise the issues. Currently, only six of the ten labels were used for the
issues that were posted. These were: bugs, data, enhancements, good first issue, help wanted and
questions (Table 2).
Bugs referred to any error in the data or issue related to a feature of either the dashboard or function
within the repository. The single unresolved issue in bugs related to a single incorrect data entry,
but finding the source confirming the correct data proved challenging. Data were any inquiry about
the data including differences between data sets, missing data, or additions to datasets. To resolve
these issues, data needs to be updated from the source. Enhancement meant improvements to current

implementations of either the data in the repository or dashboard. Pending information for most of
these enhancements. These include additional fields that were not provided in the publicly available
data. Good first issues were entry level problems that could be completed by people from any
background. These were labelled as such for newcomers to the project that did not require either a lot
of time or expertise to work on. Help wanted translated to problems that require additional attention.
The unresolved issues require data that are not currently available to the public in order to solve the
issues. Questions were presented as general request for clarity or required more information on a
particular issue in the repository that another person posted. To resolve the one unresolved question, a
decision has to be made internally about the data to resolve the matter. There were more than 10,000
additions to the repository data, and 1,430 deletions, all reviewed by different members of DSFSI
and accepted if they were noteworthy contributions to the repository. In addition to this, there were
26 different contributors who pushed 345 commits to all branches within the repository.
The majority of requests and changes to the repository and dashboard were associated with the
data or enhancements to the data. In total, there are fifteen datasets, with seven of them related to
information about hospitals in SA. Once created, the subsequent data were displayed in a dashboard
[6]. Included in the dashboard were information related to COVID-19, a South African helpline,
sources of the information, when last the information was updated, a blog post containing the purpose
of the dashboard, links to the open public repository, and general information about the research

Data are one of the most important assets during a crisis. Unfortunately, not prioritising this
commodity had complications during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic from a South African
perspective. To prevent this from happening, the DSFSI research group have started collaborating and
expanding this type of methodology to create a line list for the rest of the African continent3 . The data
from this project led to discussion between DSFSI and the NICD and DoH, in an attempt to assist the
situation. The COVID-19 pandemic showed the world the value of data, and that people and systems
should effectively prepare for a time of crisis. Enabling the public to engage with data in a way that is
open and collaborative is an overlooked service that can aid during a calamity. Furthermore, having

readily available data is useful when needed during an emergency, but can seem redundant during
peaceful times. Therefore, prioritising data management practices, getting input from the people who
use the information, and collaborating between different organisations to gain the same result should
be a proactive approach and standard, not one that is only implemented during a catastrophe.
