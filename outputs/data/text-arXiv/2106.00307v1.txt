Abstract: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is being responded with various methods,
applying vaccines, experimental treatment options, total lockdowns or partial curfews.
Weekend curfews is one of the methods to reduce the amount of infected persons and this
method is practically applied in some countries such as Turkey. In this study, the effect
of weekend curfews on reducing the spread of a contagious disease, such as COVID-19,
is modeled using a Monte Carlo algorithm with a hybrid lattice model. In the simulation
setup, a fictional country with three towns and 26,610 citizens were used as a model.
Results indicate that applying a weekend curfew reduces the active cases significantly
and is one of the efficient ways to fight the epidemic. The results also show that applying

1

personal precautions such as social distancing is important for reducing the number of
cases and deaths.
Key words: Monte Carlo simulation, epidemic, curfew, SIR, COVID-19
1. Introduction
The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently ongoing since December
2019. To the best of our knowledge, there is no approved specific antiviral drug treatment
for SARS-CoV-2 (Tarighi et al. 2021) and vaccination efforts are conducted worldwide.
The spread of the disease is ongoing and various countries are applying nationwide and/or
local measures for preventing the spread of the disease.
As of May 2021, different countries and communities follow different ways to combat
the disease: Vaccination, partial curfews and full quarantines. Among the examples,
Turkey applies a partial curfew which applies a travel ban for all citizens (except for
mandatory duties) on weekends. This 2-day curfew is applied at least to the end of May
2021.
By the means of in silico and computational methods, many scientists are working on
discovering the genome analysis and mutations (Ugurel et al. 2020, Eskier et al. 2021),
using epidemiological simulation. By the means of epidemiological data fitting and
simulation there are two main approaches: The first one is to fit the data with
mathematical models and the second one is to simulate and generate data in consistency
with the real clinical data (Maltezos and Georgakopoulou 2021). Previously, several
studies on modeling infectious diseases by the means of random walk and stochastic
processes have been reported (Filipe and Gibson 1998, 2001, Draief and Ganesh 2011,

2

Bestehorn et al. 2021). Monte Carlo (MC) simulation is one of the efficient methods for
generation of a decision making tool (Xie 2020). Different MC studies have been reported
for COVID-19 spread, such as analyzing different scenarios for selected countries
(Vyklyuk et al. 2021), age-structured mobility data for simulation of the pandemic spread
in selected cities (De Sousa et al. 2020) and random-walk proximity-based infection
spread (Triambak and Mahapatra 2021).
The aim of this paper is to observe the effects of disease detection rate and the chance of
recovery for a contagious disease under a weekend curfew scenario, similar to the one
applied in Turkey. In the model, three different towns with a total population of 26,610
were modeled in a hybrid model of susceptible, infected and recovered (SIR) model
(Kermack and Mckendrick 1927, Huppert and Katriel 2013, Shu et al. 2016), lattice
model (Liccardo and Fierro 2013) and spin-1 Ising model (Berker and Wortis 1976,
Hoston and Berker 1991).
2. Methods
The Monte Carlo model used in this study is written in the C & C++ language by the
authors. A fictional country with a population of 26,610 and three separate towns (namely
A, B and C, as shown in Figure 1) are generated. Each person in the towns are placed
randomly on an Ising-like model where the neighbors of each particle can be another
person or a void space (as shown in Figure 2). In order to improve the randomness in
movement, there are also “obstacles” which are simply lattice points which are impossible
to be on.
FIGURE 1
FIGURE 2

3

The following attributes are possible for each particle: a) Healthy, b) sick and
undiagnosed, c) sick and in quarantine, d) recovered (cured), e) dead. Option b “sick and
undiagnosed” is used for simulation of both undiagnosed persons and asymptomatic
cases.
In each Monte Carlo step, particles are selected and a random possible direction is
assigned to this particle as the movement. After selecting and checking the movement of
all possible particles, this is called one Monte Carlo step and named as “day” in the
simulation. In the following “day”, the process is repeated for all particles.
On day 7, a randomized person gets infected on Town A and starts spreading the disease
(patient zero). On day 15, the disease spreads to a random position in Town B. On day
22, the disease spreads to a random position in Town C.
An infected person can spread the disease at a certain probability Pspread and the sickness
is detected at a probability of Pdetection.
If the person is diagnosed with the disease, then the rate of successful treatment is
Ptreatment. This person goes to quarantine, which means the person is immobile and cannot
transmit the virus (Pspread = 0) until the disease is cured.
If the disease in the person is not properly diagnosed, then the rate of the survival is
Psurvival. In both cases, the person either gets cured or dies (based on Ptreatment or Psurvival)
after 28 days.
The government applies a curfew on weekends like Turkey, beginning on day 13, which
is 6 days after the first detection. On curfew, persons are immobile and are not able to
spread the disease. On weekdays (5 days), all persons are mobile and can spread the virus

4

except the persons under quarantine. A cured person can not be reinfected and does not
spread the virus.
Spread of the virus and infection is modeled by the generation of a random number r on
each Monte Carlo step. If r > P, then the aforementioned event occurs. For instance, if
day > 28 and r > Ptreatment, then the person gets recovered.
3. Results and Discussion
Figure 3 shows the spread of the disease on days 0, 11 and 24. The ill persons are marked
with red, indicating the random movement of the ill persons as well as the spread of
disease at a probability of Pspread.
FIGURE 3
In order to test the model, a SIQR - susceptible, infected, in quarantine and recovered –
plot is generated as shown in Figure 4. In the test model, nobody dies because of the
disease and accordingly, with the onset of the infection, the sums of the ratios of each
case is always 1.0, indicating the model works for the given simulation setup.
FIGURE 4
The effect of weekend curfews is shown in Figure 5. This figure indicates the start day of
the weekend curfews when compared to the case without the weekend curfews, where all
plots were obtained at a detection probability of 0.3 for comparison. As indicated in the
plot, starting the weekend curfew early as day 14 decreases the ratio of ill persons from
0.22 to 0.15, as well as widening the peak. Reducing the amount of ill persons at a given
time is very important for reducing the workloads of health professionals and efficiently
using capacities of intensive care units (Farsalinos et al. 2021). Therefore, the effect of

5

curfews are clearly visible in the given simulation. Prolonging the starting day of the
weekend curfews slowly shifts the curve to the left, i.e. to the case without any
curfew/nationwide lockdown.
FIGURE 5
In the second part of the study, the effect of varying Pspread on the death rate was
investigated. Here, Pspread varied from 0.1 to 1.0, with an increase of 0.1 and the
simulation repeated for different Pspread values, with an assumption of asymptomatic cases
always recover, where weekend curfews continue. The result of this simulation is shown
in Figure 6. It is clear that reducing the Pspread decreases the death ratio significantly,
which demonstrates the importance of social distancing, wearing masks and complying
with other hygiene precautions in combating the spread of the disease.
FIGURE 6

Conclusion
By applying a weekend curfew e.g., two-day alternating lockdowns and five-day free
motion on particles being simulated in this study, it is found that the ratio of infected
decreases by 68% at the peak point. It is also evident that starting this curfew is more
efficient when started earlier (day 14 in this study). Turkey also observed a similar pattern
of case decrease by following the weekend curfews for combating COVID-19. Monte
Carlo simulations remain as a strong tool not only for predicting the spread of contagious
diseases, but also for modeling the alternative precaution measures. Further and detailed
studies might show the effects of disobeying the curfew, age, gender and other parameters
as well as the effect of vaccines altogether for modeling the epidemic/pandemic.
