Abstract. The paper evaluates the dynamic impact of various policies adopted by US
states on the growth rates of confirmed Covid-19 cases and deaths as well as social distancing behavior measured by Google Mobility Reports, where we take into consideration
people’s voluntarily behavioral response to new information of transmission risks in a
causal structural model framework. Our analysis finds that both policies and information
on transmission risks are important determinants of Covid-19 cases and deaths and shows
that a change in policies explains a large fraction of observed changes in social distancing
behavior. Our main counterfactual experiments suggest that nationally mandating face
masks for employees early in the pandemic could have reduced the weekly growth rate
of cases and deaths by more than 10 percentage points in late April and could have led
to as much as 19 to 47 percent less deaths nationally by the end of May, which roughly
translates into 19 to 47 thousand saved lives. We also find that, without stay-at-home
orders, cases would have been larger by 6 to 63 percent and without business closures,
cases would have been larger by 17 to 78 percent. We find considerable uncertainty over
the effects of school closures due to lack of cross-sectional variation; we could not robustly
rule out either large or small effects. Overall, substantial declines in growth rates are
attributable to private behavioral response, but policies played an important role as well.
We also carry out sensitivity analyses to find neighborhoods of the models under which the
results hold robustly: the results on mask policies appear to be much more robust than the
results on business closures and stay-at-home orders. Finally, we stress that our study is
observational and therefore should be interpreted with great caution. From a completely
agnostic point of view, our findings uncover predictive effects (association) of observed
policies and behavioral changes on future health outcomes, controlling for informational
and other confounding variables.

1. Introduction
Accumulating evidence suggests that various policies in the US have reduced social interactions and slowed down the growth of Covid-19 infections.1 An important outstanding
issue, however, is how much of the observed slow down in the spread is attributable to the
effect of policies as opposed to a voluntarily change in people’s behavior out of fear of being
infected. This question is critical for evaluating the effectiveness of restrictive policies in
the US relative to an alternative policy of just providing recommendations and information
such as the one adopted by Sweden. More generally, understanding people’s dynamic behavioral response to policies and information is indispensable for properly evaluating the
effect of policies on the spread of Covid-19.
This paper quantitatively assesses the impact of various policies adopted by US states on
the spread of Covid-19, such as non-essential business closure and mandatory face masks,
paying particular attention to how people adjust their behavior in response to policies as
well as new information on cases and deaths.
We present a conceptual framework that spells out the causal structure on how the
Covid-19 spread is dynamically determined by policies and human behavior. Our approach
explicitly recognizes that policies not only directly affect the spread of Covid-19 (e.g., mask
requirement) but also indirectly affect its spread by changing people’s behavior (e.g., stayat-home order). It also recognizes that people react to new information on Covid-19 cases
and deaths and voluntarily adjust their behavior (e.g., voluntary social distancing and
hand washing) even without any policy in place. Our casual model provides a framework to
quantitatively decompose the growth of Covid-19 cases and deaths into three components:
(1) direct policy effect, (2) policy effect through behavior, and (3) direct behavior effect in
response to new information.
Guided by the causal model, our empirical analysis examines how the weekly growth
rates of confirmed Covid-19 cases and deaths are determined by (the lags of) policies and
behavior using US state-level data. To examine how policies and information affect people’s
behavior, we also regress social distancing measures on policy and information variables.
Our regression specification for case and death growths is explicitly guided by a SIR model
although our causal approach does not hinge on the validity of a SIR model.
As policy variables, we consider mandatory face masks for employees in public businesses,
stay-at-home orders (or shelter-in-place orders), closure of K-12 schools, closure of restaurants except take out, closure of movie theaters, and closure of non-essential businesses.
Our behavior variables are four mobility measures that capture the intensity of visits to
“transit,” “grocery,” “retail,” and “workplaces” from Google Mobility Reports. We take
the lagged growth rate of cases and deaths and the log of lagged cases and deaths at both
the state-level and the national-level as our measures of information on infection risks that
affects people’s behavior. We also consider the growth rate of tests, month dummies, and

state-level characteristics (e.g., population size and total area) as confounders that have to
be controlled for in order to identify the causal relationship between policy/behavior and
the growth rate of cases and deaths.
Our key findings from regression analysis are as follows. We find that both policies
and information on past cases and deaths are important determinants of people’s social
distancing behavior, where policy effects explain more than 50% of the observed decline in
the four behavior variables.2 Our estimates suggest that there are both large policy effects
and large behavioral effects on the growth of cases and deaths. Except for mandatory masks,
the effect of policies on cases and deaths is indirectly materialized through their impact on
behavior; the effect of mandatory mask policy is direct without affecting behavior.
Using the estimated model, we evaluate the dynamic impact of the following three counterfactual policies on Covid-19 cases and deaths: (1) mandating face masks, (2) allowing
all businesses to open, and (3) not implementing a stay-at-home order. The counterfactual experiments show a large impact of those policies on the number of cases and deaths.
They also highlight the importance of voluntary behavioral response to infection risks when
evaluating the dynamic policy effects.
Our estimates imply that nationally implementing mandatory face masks for employees
in public businesses on March 14th would have reduced the growth rate of cases and that
of deaths by approximately 10 percentage points in late April. As shown in Figure 1, this
leads to reductions of 21% and 34% in cumulative reported cases and deaths, respectively,
by the end of May with 90 percent confidence intervals of [9, 32]% and [19, 47]%, which
roughly implies that 34 thousand lives could have been saved. This finding is significant:
given this potentially large benefit of reducing the spread of Covid-19, mandating masks
is an attractive policy instrument especially because it involves relatively little economic
disruption. These estimates contribute to the ongoing efforts towards designing approaches
to minimize risks from reopening (Stock, 2020b).
Figure 2 illustrates how never closing any businesses (no movie theater closure, no nonessential business closure, and no closure of restaurants except take-out) could have affected
cases and deaths. We estimate that business shutdowns have roughly the same impact on
growth rates as mask mandates, albeit with more uncertainty. The point estimates indicate
that keeping all businesses open could have increased cumulative cases and deaths by 40%
at the end of May (with 90 percent confidence intervals of [17, 78]% for cases and [1, 97]%
for deaths).
Figure 3 shows that stay-at-home orders had effects of similar magnitude as business
closures. No stay-at-home orders could have led to 37% more cases by the start of June
with a 90 percent confidence interval given by 6% to 63%. The estimated effect of no stayat-home orders on deaths is a slightly smaller with a 90 percent confidence interval of −7%
to 50%.
2The behavior accounts for the other half. This is in line with theoretical study by Gitmez, Sonin,
and Wright (2020) that investigates the role of private behavior and negative external effects for individual
decisions over policy compliance as well as information acquisition during pandemics.

We also conducted sensitivity analysis with respect to changes to our regression specification, sample selection, methodology, and assumptions about delays between policy changes
and changes in recorded cases. In particular, we examined whether certain effect sizes can
be ruled out by various more flexible models or by using alternative timing assumptions
that define forward growth rates. The impact of mask mandates is more robustly and more
precisely estimated than that of business closure policies or stay-at-home orders, and an
undesirable effect of increasing the weekly death growth by 5 percentage points is ruled out
by all of the models we consider.3 This is largely due to the greater variation in the timing of
mask mandates across states. The findings of shelter-in-place and business closures policies
are considerably less robust. For example, for stay-at-home mandates, models with alternative timing and richer specification for information set suggested smaller effects. Albeit
after application of machine learning tools to reduce dimensionality, the range of effects
[0, 0.15] could not be ruled out. A similar wide range of effects could not be ruled out for
business closures.
We also examine the impact of school closures. Unfortunately, there is very little variation
across states in the timing of school closures. Across robustness specifications, we obtain
point estimates of the effect of school closures as low as 0 and as high as -0.6. In particular,
we find that the results are sensitive to whether the number of past national cases/deaths
is included in a specification or not. This highlights the uncertainty regarding the impact
of some policies versus private behavioral responses to information.

masks on March 14th. The thick blue line is the estimated change in cumulative cases or deaths relative to
the observed number of cases or deaths. The shaded region is a pointwise 90% confidence band.

3This null hypothesis can be generated by looking at the meta-evidence from RCTs on the efficacy of

masks in preventing other respiratory cold-like deceases. Falsely rejecting this null is costly in terms of
potential loss of life, and so it is a reasonable null choice for the mask policy from decision-theoretic point
of view.

A growing number of other papers have examined the link between non-pharmaceutical
interventions and Covid-19 cases.4 Hsiang et al. (2020) estimate the effect of policies on
the growth rate of cases using data from the United States, China, Iran, Italy, France, and
South Korea. In the United States, they find that the combined effect of all policies they
consider on the growth rate is −0.347 (0.061). Courtemanche et al. (2020) use US county

Covid-19; here we focus on few quintessential comparisons on our work with other works that we are aware
of.

level data to analyze the effect of interventions on case growth rates. They find that the
combination of policies they study reduced growth rates by 9.1 percentage points 16-20
days after implementation, out of which 5.9 percentage points are attributable to shelter in
place orders. Both Hsiang et al. (2020) and Courtemanche et al. (2020) adopt a reducedform approach to estimate the total policy effect on case growth without using any social
distancing behavior measures.5
Existing evidence for the impact of social distancing policies on behavior in the US is
mixed. Abouk and Heydari (2020) employ a difference-in-differences methodology to find
that statewide stay-at-home orders have strong causal impacts on reducing social interactions. In contrast, using data from Google Mobility Reports, Maloney and Taskin (2020)
find that the increase in social distancing is largely voluntary and driven by information.6
Another study by Gupta et al. (2020) also found little evidence that stay-at-home mandates
induced distancing by using mobility measures from PlaceIQ and SafeGraph. Using data
from SafeGraph, Andersen (2020) shows that there has been substantial voluntary social
distancing but also provide evidence that mandatory measures such as stay-at-home orders
have been effective at reducing the frequency of visits outside of one’s home.
Pei, Kandula, and Shaman (2020) use county-level observations of reported infections
and deaths in conjunction with mobility data from SafeGraph to conduct simulation of
implementing all policies 1-2 weeks earlier and found that it would have resulted in reducing
the number of cases and deaths by more than half. However, their study does not explicitly
analyze how policies are related to the effective reproduction numbers.
Epidemiologists use model simulations to predict how cases and deaths evolve for the purpose of policy recommendation. As reviewed by Avery et al. (2020), there exists substantial
uncertainty about the values of key epidimiological parameters (see also Atkeson, 2020a;
Stock, 2020a). Simulations are often done under strong assumptions about the impact of
social distancing policies without connecting to the relevant data (e.g., Ferguson et al.,
2020). Furthermore, simulated models do not take into account that people may limit their
contact with other people in response to higher transmission risks.7 When such a voluntary
behavioral response is ignored, simulations would necessarily exhibit exponential spread
and over-predict cases and deaths. In contrast, as cases and deaths rise, a voluntary behavioral response may possibly reduce the effective reproduction number below 1, potentially
preventing exponential spread. Our counterfactual experiments illustrate the importance
of this voluntary behavioral change.

5Using a synthetic control approach, Cho (2020) finds that the cases would have been lower by 75 percent

had Sweden adopted stricter lockdown policies.
6Specifically, they find that of the 60 percentage point drop in workplace intensity, 40 percentage points
can be explained by changes in information as proxied by case numbers, while roughly 8 percentage points
can be explained by policy changes.
7See Atkeson (2020b) and Stock (2020a) for the implications of the SIR model for Covid-19 in the US.
Fernández-Villaverde and Jones (2020) estimate a SIRD model in which time-varying reproduction numbers
depend on the daily deaths to capture feedback from daily deaths to future behavior and infections.

Whether wearing masks in public place should be mandatory or not has been one of the
most contested policy issues with health authorities of different countries providing contradictory recommendations. Reviewing evidence, Greenhalgh et al. (2020) recognize that
there is no randomized controlled trial evidence for the effectiveness of face masks, but they
state “indirect evidence exists to support the argument for the public wearing masks in the
Covid-19 pandemic.”8 Howard et al. (2020) also review available medical evidence and conclude that “mask wearing reduces the transmissibility per contact by reducing transmission
of infected droplets in both laboratory and clinical contexts.” The laboratory findings in
Hou et al. (2020) suggest that the nasal cavity may be the initial site of infection followed
by aspiration to the lung, supporting the argument “for the widespread use of masks to
prevent aersol, large droplet, and/or mechanical exposure to the nasal passages.” He et al.
(2020) examined temporal patterns of viral shedding in COVID-19 patients and found the
highest viral load at the time of symptom onset; this suggests that a significant portion
of transmission may have occurred before symptom onset and that universal face masks
may be an effective control measure to reduce transmission.9 Ollila et al. (2020) provide a
meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of non-surgical face masks in preventing viral
respiratory infections in non-hospital and non-household settings, finding that face masks
decreased infections across all five studies they reviewed.10
Given the lack of experimental evidence on the effect of masks in the context of COVID19, conducting observational studies is useful and important. To the best of our knowledge,
our paper is the first empirical study that shows the effectiveness of mask mandates on
reducing the spread of Covid-19 by analyzing the US state-level data. This finding corroborates and is complementary to the medical observational evidence in Howard et al. (2020).
Analyzing mitigation measures in New York, Wuhan, and Italy, Zhang et al. (2020b) conclude that mandatory face coverings substantially reduced infections. Abaluck et al. (2020)
find that the growth rates of cases and of deaths in countries with pre-existing norms that
sick people should wear masks are lower by 8 to 10% than those rates in countries with no
pre-existing mask norms.11 The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington assesses that, if 95% of the people in the US were to start wearing masks
from early August of 2020, 66,000 lives would be saved by December 2020 (IHME, 2020),
which is largely consistent with our results. Our finding is also independently corroborated
8The virus remains viable in the air for several hours, for which surgical masks may be effective. Also, a

substantial fraction of individual who are infected become infectious before showing symptom onset.
9Lee et al. (2020a) find evidence that viral loads in asymptomatic patients are similar to those in symptomatic patients. Aerosol transmission of viruses may occur through aerosols particles released during
breathing and speaking by asymptomatic infected individuals; masks reduce such airborne transmission
(Prather, Wang, and Schooley, 2020). Anfinrud et al. (2020) provide visual evidence of speech-generated
droplet as well as the effectiveness of cloth masks to reduce the emission of droplets. Chu et al. (2020)
conduct a meta-analysis of observational studies on transmission of the viruses that cause COVID-19 and
related diseases and find the effectiveness of mask use for reducing transmission.
10Whether wearing masks creates a false sense of security and leads to decrease in social distancing is
also a hotly debated topic. A randomized field experiment in Berlin, Germany, conducted by Seres et al.
(2020) finds that wearing masks actually increases social distancing, providing no evidence that mandatory
masks leads to decrease in social distancing.
11Miyazawa and Kaneko (2020) find that country’s COVID-19 death rates are negatively associated with
mask wearing rates.

by a completely different causal methodology based on synthetic control using German data
in Mitze et al. (2020).12
Our empirical results contribute to informing the economic-epidemiological models that
combine economic models with variants of SIR models to evaluate the efficiency of various
economic policies aimed at the gradual “reopening” of various sectors of economy.13 For
example, the estimated effects of masks, stay-home mandates, and various other policies on
behavior, and of behavior on infection can serve as useful inputs and validation checks in the
calibrated macro, sectoral, and micro models (see, e.g., Alvarez, Argente, and Lippi (2020);
Baqaee et al. (2020); Fernández-Villaverde and Jones (2020); Acemoglu et al. (2020); Keppo
et al. (2020); McAdams (2020) and references therein). Furthermore, the causal framework
developed in this paper could be applicable, with appropriate extensions, to the impact of
policies on economic outcomes replacing health outcomes (see, e.g., Chetty et al. (2020);
Coibion, Gorodnichenko, and Weber (2020)).
Finally, our causal model is framed using the language of structural equations models
and causal diagrams of econometrics (Wright (1928); Haavelmo (1944); Tinbergen (1940);
Wold (1954); Pearl (1995)) and genetics (Wright, 1923),14 with natural unfolding potential/structural outcomes representation (Rubin, 1974; Tinbergen, 1930; Neyman, 1925; Imbens and Rubin, 2015). The work on causal graphs has been modernized and developed
by Pearl (1995); Greenland, Pearl, and Robins (1999); Pearl (2009); Pearl and Mackenzie (2018) and many others (e.g., Pearl and Mackenzie (2018); White and Chalak (2009);
Robins, Richardson, and Shpitser (2020); Peters, Janzing, and Bernhard (2017); Bareinboim
et al. (2020); Hernán and Robins (2020)), with applications in computer science, genetics,
epidemiology, and econometrics (see, e.g., Heckman and Pinto (2013); Hünermund and
Bareinboim (2019); White and Chalak (2009) for applications in econometrics). The particular causal diagram we use has several “mediation” components, where variables affect
outcomes directly and indirectly through other variables called mediators; these structures
go back at least to Wright (1923, see Figure 6); see, e.g., Baron and Kenny (1986), Hines,
Vansteelandt, and Diaz-Ordaz (2020), Robins, Richardson, and Shpitser (2020) for modern
treatments.

12Our study was first released in ArXiv on May 28, 2020 whereas Mitze et al. (2020) was released at
SSRN on June 8, 2020.
13Adda (2016) analyzes the effect of policies reducing interpersonal contacts such as school closures or the
closure of public transportation networks on the spread of influenza, gastroenteritis, and chickenpox using

14The father and son, P. Wright (economist) and S. Wright (geneticist) collaborated to develop structural
equation models and causal path diagrams; P. Wright’s key work represented supply-demand system as
a directed acyclical graph and established its identification using exclusion restrictions on instrumental
variables. We view our work as following this classical tradition.

2. The Causal Model for the Effect of Policies, Behavior, and Information
on Growth of Infection
2.1. The Causal Model and Its Structural Equation Form. We introduce our approach through the Wright-style causal diagram shown in Figure 4. The diagram describes
how policies, behavior, and information interact together:
• The forward health outcome, Yi,t+` , is determined last, after all other variables have
been determined;
• The adopted policies, Pit , affect health outcome Yi,t+` either directly, or indirectly
by altering human behavior Bit ;
• Information variables, Iit , such as lagged values of outcomes can affect human behavior and policies, as well as outcomes;
• The confounding factors Wit , which vary across states and time, affect all other
variables.
The index i denotes observational unit, the state, and t and t + ` denotes the time, where
` is a positive integer that represents the time lag between infection and case confirmation
or death.

Our main outcomes of interest are the growth rates in Covid-19 cases and deaths, behavioral variables include proportion of time spent in transit, shopping, and workplaces, policy
variables include mask mandates, stay-at-home orders, and school and business closures,
and the information variables include lagged values of outcome. We provide a detailed
description of these variables and their timing in the next section.
The causal structure allows for the effect of the policy to be either direct or indirect –
through behavior or through dynamics; all of these effects are not mutually exclusive. The
structure also allows for changes in behavior to be brought by change in policies and information. These are all realistic properties that we expect from the contextual knowledge
of the problem. Policies such as closures of schools, non-essential business, and restaurants alter and constrain behavior in strong ways. In contrast, policies such as mandating

10

employees to wear masks can potentially affect the Covid-19 transmission directly. The
information variables, such as recent growth in the number of cases, can cause people to
spend more time at home, regardless of adopted state policies; these changes in behavior in
turn affect the transmission of Covid-19. Importantly, policies can have the informational
content as well, guiding behavior rather than constraining it.
The causal ordering induced by this directed acyclical graph is determined by the following timing sequence:
(1)

information and confounders get determined at t,
policies are set in place, given information and confounders at t;
behavior is realized, given policies, information, and confounders at t;
outcomes get realized at t+` given policies, behavior, information, and confounders.

The model also allows for direct dynamic effects of information variables on the outcome
through autoregressive structures that capture persistence in growth patterns. As highlighted below, realized outcomes may become new information for future periods, inducing
dynamics over multiple periods.
Our quantitative model for causal structure in Figure 4 is given by the following econometric structural (or potential) outcomes model:
Yi,t+` (b, p, ι) :=α0 b + π 0 p + µ0 ι + δY0 Wit + εyit ,
0
:=β 0 p + γ 0 ι + δB
Wit + εbit ,

Bit (p, ι)

(SO)

which is a collection of functional relations with stochastic shocks, decomposed into observable part δ 0 W and unobservable part ε. The terms εyit and εbit are the centered stochastic
shocks that obey the orthogonality restrictions posed below.
The policies can be modeled via a linear form as well,
Pit (ι) := η 0 ι + δP0 Wit + εpit ,

(P)

although linearity is not critical.15
The exogeneity restrictions on the stochastic shocks are as follows:
εyit ⊥ (εbit , εpit , Wit , Iit ),
εbit ⊥ (εpit , Wit , Iit ),

(E)

εpit ⊥ (Wit , Iit ),

15Under some additional independence conditions, this can be replaced by an arbitrary non-additive

function Pit (ι) = p(ι, Wit , εpit ), such that the unconfoundedness condition stated in the next footnote holds.

where we say that V ⊥ U if EV U = 0.16 This is a standard way of representing restrictions
on errors in structural equation modeling in econometrics.17
The observed variables are generated by setting ι = Iit and propagating the system from
the last equation to the first:
Yi,t+` :=Yi,t+` (Bit , Pit , Iit ),
Bit

:=Bit (Pit , Iit ),

Pit

:=Pit (Iit ).

(O)

The specification of the model above grasps one-period responses. The dynamics over
multiple periods will be induced by the evolution of information variables, which include
time, lagged and integrated values of outcome:18

m=0

for each t ∈ {0, 1, ..., T }, where g is deterministic function of time, e.g., month indicators,
assuming that the log of new cases at time t ≤ 0 is zero, for notational convenience. 19
In this structure, people respond to both global information, captured by a function of
time such as month dummies, and local information sources, captured by the local growth
rate and the total number of cases. The local information also captures the persistence
of the growth rate process. We model the reaction of people’s behavior via the term γ 0 It
in the behavior equation. The lagged values of behavior variable may be also included in
the information set, but we postpone this discussion after the main empirical results are
presented.
With any structure of this form, realized outcomes may become new information for
future periods, inducing a dynamical system over multiple periods. We show the resulting
dynamical system in a diagram of Figure 5. Specification of this system is useful for studying delayed effects of policies and behaviors and in considering the counterfactual policy
analysis.
Next we combine the above parts together with an appropriate initializations to give a
formal definition of the model we use.
16An alternative useful starting point is to impose the Rosenbaum-Rubin type unconfoundedness condi-

tion:
Yi,t+` (·, ·, ·) ⊥
⊥ (Pit , Bit , Iit ) | Wit , Bit (·, ·) ⊥
⊥ (Pit , Iit ) | Wit , Pit (·) ⊥
⊥ Iit | Wit ,
which imply, with treating stochastic errors as independent additive components, the orthogonal conditions
stated above. The same unconfoundedness restrictions can be formulated using formal causal DAGs, and also
imply orthogonality restrictions stated above, once stochastic errors are modeled as independent additive
components.
17
The structural equations of this form are connected to triangular structural equation models, appearing
in microeconometrics and macroeconometrics (SVARs), going back to the work of Strotz and Wold (1960).
18Our empirical analysis also considers a specification in which information variables include lagged
national cases/deaths as well as lagged behavior variables.

Structural Equations Model (SEM). Let i ∈ {1, ..., N } denote the
observational unit, t be the time periods, and ` be the time delay. (1) For
each i and t ≤ −`, the confounder, information, behavior, and policy variables Wit , Iit , Bit , Pit are determined outside of the model, and the outcome
variable Yi,t+` is determined by factors outside of the model for t ≤ 0. (2)
For each i and t ≥ −`, confounders Wit are determined by factors outside of
the model, and information variables Iit are determined by (I); policy variables Pit are determined by setting ι = Iit in (P) with a realized stochastic
shock εpit that obeys the exogeneity condition (E); behavior variables Bit are
determined by setting ι = Iit and p = Pit in (SO) with a shock εbit that obeys
(E); finally, the outcome Yi,t+` is realized by setting ι = Iit , p = Pit , and
b = Bit in (SO) with a shock εyit that obeys (E).
2.2. Main Testable Implication, Identification, Parameter Estimation. The system above together with orthogonality restrictions (E) implies the following collection of
projection equations for realized variables:
Yi,t+` = α0 Bit + π 0 Pit + µ0 Iit + δY0 Wit + εyit ,

εyit ⊥ Bit , Pit , Iit , Wit

Bit = β 0 Pit + γ 0 Iit + δB

Therefore the projection equation:
Yi,t+` = a0 Pit + b0 Iit + δ̃ 0 Wit + ε̄it ,

ε̄it ⊥ Pit , Iit , Wit .

(Y∼PI)

should obey:
a0 = (α0 β 0 + π 0 ) and b0 = (α0 γ 0 + µ0 ).

(TR)

Without any exclusion restrictions, this equality is just a decomposition of total effects
into direct and indirect components and is not a testable restriction. However, in our case
we rely on the SIR model with testing to motivate the presence of change in testing rate
as a confounder in the outcome equations but not in the behavior equation (therefore,

CAUSAL IMPACT OF MASKS, POLICIES, BEHAVIOR

13

a component of δB and δP is set to 0), implying that (TR) does not necessarily hold
and is testable. Furthermore, we estimate (PI→B) on the data set that has many more
observations than the data set used to estimate the outcome equations, implying that (TR)
is again testable. Later we shall also try to utilize the contextual knowledge that mask
mandates only affect the outcome directly and not by changing mobility (i.e., β = 0 for
mask policy), implying again that (TR) is testable. If not rejected by the data, (TR) can
be used to sharpen the estimate of the causal effect of mask policies on the outcomes.
Validation of the model by (TR) allows us to check exclusion restrictions brought by contextual knowledge and check stability of the model by using different data subsets. However,
passing the (TR) does not guarantee that the model is necessarily valid for recovering causal
effects. The only fundamental way to truly validate a causal model for observational data
is through a controlled experiment, which is impossible to carry out in our setting.
The parameters of the SEM are identified by the projection equation set above, provided
the latter are identified by sufficient joint variation of these variables across states and time.
We can develop this point formally as follows. Consider the previous system of equations,
after partialling out the confounders:
Ỹi,t+` =α0 B̃it + π 0 P̃it + µ0 I˜it + εyit ,
B̃it
=β 0 P̃it + γ 0 I˜it + εb ,

(1)

⊥ P̃it , I˜it ,

where Ṽit = Vit −Wit0 E[Wit Wit0 ]− E[Wit Vit ] denotes the residual after removing the orthogonal
projection of Vit on Wit . The residualization is a linear operator, implying that (1) follows
immediately from the above. The parameters of (1) are identified as projection coefficients
in these equations, provided that residualized vectors appearing in each of the equations
have non-singular variance, that is
Var(P̃it0 , B̃it0 , I˜it0 ) > 0, Var(P̃it0 , I˜it0 ) > 0, and Var(I˜it0 ) > 0.

(2)

Our main estimation method is the standard correlated random effects estimator, where
the random effects are parameterized as functions of observable characteristic, Wit , which
include both state-level and time random effects. The state-level random effects are modeled
as a function of state level characteristics, and the time random effects are modeled by
including month dummies and their interactions with state level characteristics (in the
sensitivity analysis, we also add weekly dummies). The stochastic shocks {εit }Tt=1 are treated
as independent across states i and can be arbitrarily dependent across time t within a state.
Another modeling approach is the fixed effects panel data model, where Wit includes
latent (unobserved) state level confonders Wi and and time level effects Wt , which must be
estimated from the data. This approach is much more demanding of the data and relies on
long time and cross-sectional histories to estimate Wi and Wt , resulting in amplification of
uncertainty. In addition, when histories are relatively short, large biases emerge and they

14

need to be removed using debiasing methods, see e.g., Chen, Chernozhukov, and FernándezVal (2019) for overview. We present the results on debiased fixed effect estimation with
weekly dummies as parts of our sensitivity analysis. Our sensitivity analysis also considers
a debiased machine learning approach using Random Forest in which observed confounders
enter the model nonlinearly.
With exclusion restrictions there are multiple approaches to estimation, for example,
via generalized method of moments. We shall take a more pragmatic approach where we
estimate the parameters of equations separately and then compute

with approximate deviations controlled by the normal laws, with standard deviations that
can be approximated by the bootstrap resampling of observational units i. Under correct
specification the target quantities reduce to
α0 β 0 + π 0 and α0 γ 0 + µ0 ,
respectively.20

2.3. Counterfactual Policy Analysis. We also consider simple counterfactual exercises,
where we examine the effects of setting a sequence of counterfactual policies for each state:
{Pit? }Tt=1 ,

i = 1, . . . N.

(CF-P)

We assume that the SEM remains invariant, except for the policy equation.21 The assumption of invariance captures the idea that counterfactual policy interventions would not
change the structural functions within the period of the study. The assumption is strong
but is necessary to conduct counterfactual experiments, e.g. Sims (1972) and Strotz and
Wold (1960). To make the assumption more plausible we limited our study to the early
pandemic period.22
20This construction is not as efficient as generalized method of moments but has a nicer interpretation

under possible misspecification of the model: we are combining predictions from two models, one motivated
via the causal path, reflecting contextual knowledge, and another from a “reduced form” model not exploiting
the path. The combined estimator can improve on precision of either estimator.
21It is possible to consider counterfactual exercises in which policy responds to information through
the policy equation if we are interested in endogenous policy responses to information. Counterfactual
experiments with endogenous government policy would be important, for example, to understand the issues
related to the lagged response of government policies to higher infection rates due to incomplete information.
22Furthermore, we conducted several stability checks, for example, checking if the coefficients on mask
policies remain stable (reported in the previous version) and also looking at more recent data during reopening, beyond early pandemic, to examine the stability of the model.

CAUSAL IMPACT OF MASKS, POLICIES, BEHAVIOR

Given the policies, we generate the counterfactual outcomes, behavior, and information
by propagating the dynamic equations:

Bit?

:=Bit (Pit? , Iit? ),

Iit?

?
:=It (Yit? , Ii,t−`
),

(CF-SEM)

with the same initialization as the factual system up to t ≤ 0. In stating this counterfactual
system of equations, we assume that structural outcome equations (SO) and information
equations (I) remain invariant and so do the stochastic shocks, decomposed into observable
and unobservable parts. Formally, we record this assumption and above discussion as
follows.
Counterfactual Structural Equations Model (CF-SEM). Let i ∈
{1, ..., N } be the observational unit, t be time periods, and ` be the time
delay. (1) For each i and t ≤ 0, the confounder, information, behavior,
policy, and outcome variables are determined as previously stated in SEM:
Wit? = Wit , Iit? = Iit , Bit? = Bit , Pit? = Pit , Yit? = Yit . (2) For each i and
t ≥ 0, confounders Wit? = Wit are determined as in SEM, and information
variables Iit? are determined by (I); policy variables Pit? are set in (CF-P);
behavior variables Bit? are determined by setting ι = Iit? and p = Pit? in (SO)

which describe the immediate indirect effect of the policy via behavior, the direct effect of
the policy, and the dynamic effect of the policy. By recursive substitutions the dynamic
effect can be further decomposed into a weighted sum of delayed policy effects via behavior
and a weighted sum of delayed policy effects via direct impact.
All counterfactual quantities and contrasts can be computed from the expressions given
above. For examples, given ∆Ci0 > 0, new confirmed cases are linked to growth rates via
relation (taking t divisible by ` for simplicity):


and

m=1

The cumulative cases can be constructed by summing over the new cases. Various contrasts
are then calculated from these quantities. For example, the relative contrast of counterfactual new confirmed cases to the factual confirmed cases is given by:


t/`
X
?
∆Cit? /∆Cit = exp 
(Yi,m`

m=1

We refer to the appendix for further details. Similar calculations apply for fatalities. Note
that our analysis is conditional on the factual history and structural stochastic shocks.23
23For unconditional counterfactual, we need to make assumptions about the evolution of stochastic shocks

appearing in Yit . See, e.g, previous versions of our paper in ArXiv, where unconditional counterfactuals were

CAUSAL IMPACT OF MASKS, POLICIES, BEHAVIOR

The estimated counterfactuals are smooth functionals of the underlying parameter estimates. Therefore, we construct the confidence intervals for counterfactual quantities and
contrasts by bootstrapping the parameter estimates. We refer to the appendix for further
details.
2.4. Outcome and Key Confounders via SIRD model. We next provide details of
our key measurement equations, defining the outcomes and key confounders. We motivate
the structural outcome equations via the fundamental epidemiological model for the spread
of infectious decease called the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Dead (SIRD) model with
testing.
Letting Cit denote the cumulative number of confirmed cases in state i at time t, our
outcome
Yit = ∆ log(∆Cit ) := log(∆Cit ) − log(∆Ci,t−7 )
(4)
approximates the weekly growth rate in new cases from t − 7 to t. Here ∆ denotes the
differencing operator over 7 days from t to t − 7, so that ∆Cit := Cit − Ci,t−7 is the number
of new confirmed cases in the past 7 days.
We chose this metric as this is the key metric for policy makers deciding when to relax
Covid mitigation policies. The U.S. government’s guidelines for state reopening recommend
that states display a “downward trajectory of documented cases within a 14-day period”
(White House, 2020). A negative value of Yit is an indication of meeting this criteria for
reopening. By focusing on weekly cases rather than daily cases, we smooth idiosyncratic
daily fluctuations as well as periodic fluctuations associated with days of the week.
Our measurement equation for estimating equations (BPI→Y) and (PI→Y) will take the
form:
0
∆ log(∆Cit ) = Xi,t−14
θ − γ + δT ∆ log(Tit ) + it ,

(M-C)

where i is state, t is day, Cit is cumulative confirmed cases, Tit is the number of tests
over 7 days, ∆ is a 7-days differencing operator, and it is an unobserved error term.
Xi,t−14 collects other behavioral, policy, and confounding variables, depending on whether
we estimate (BPI→Y) or (PI→Y), where the lag of 14 days captures the time lag between
infection and confirmed case (see the Appendix A.6). Here
∆ log(Tit ) := log(Tit ) − log(Ti,t−7 )
is the key confounding variable, derived from considering the SIRD model below. We are
treating the change in testing rate as exogenous.24 We describe other confounders in the
empirical section.
calculated by assuming stochastic shocks are i.i.d. and resampling them from the empirical distribution.
The differences between conditional and unconditional contrasts were small in our empirical analysis.
24To check sensitivity to this assumption we performed robustness checks, where we used the further lag
of ∆ log(Tit ) as a proxy for exogenous change in the testing rate, and we also used that as an instrument
for ∆ log(Tit ); this did not affect the results on policy effects, although the instrument was not sufficiently
strong.

18

VICTOR CHERNOZHUKOV, HIROYUKI KASAHARA, AND PAUL SCHRIMPF

Our main measurement equation (M-C) is motivated by a variant of SIRD model, where
we add confirmed cases and infection detection via testing. Let S, I, R, and D denote the
number of susceptible, infected, recovered, and deceased individuals in a given state. Each
of these variables are a function of time. We model them as evolving as
S(t)
β(t)I(t)
N
S(t)
β(t)I(t) − γI(t)
İ(t) =
N
Ṙ(t) = (1 − κ)γI(t)
Ṡ(t) = −

Ḋ(t) = κγI(t)

(5)
(6)
(7)
(8)

where N is the population, β(t) is the rate of infection spread, γ is the rate of recovery or
death, and κ is the probability of death conditional on infection.
Confirmed cases, C(t), evolve as
Ċ(t) = τ (t)I(t),

(9)

where τ (t) is the rate that infections are detected.
Our goal is to examine how the rate of infection β(t) varies with observed policies and
measures of social distancing behavior. A key challenge is that we only observed C(t) and
D(t), but not I(t). The unobserved I(t) can be eliminated by differentiating (9) and using
(6) as
S(t)
τ̇ (t)
C̈(t)
=
β(t) − γ +
.
N
τ (t)
Ċ(t)

(10)

We consider a discrete-time analogue of equation (10) to motivate our empirical specification
by relating the detection rate τ (t) to the number of tests Tit while specifying S(t)
N β(t) as a
linear function of variables Xi,t−14 . This results in
0
θ + it + δT ∆ log(T )it
∆ log(∆Cit ) = Xi,t−14
C̈(t)
Ċ(t)

S(t)
β(t)−γ
N

τ̇ (t)
τ (t)

which is equation (M-C), where Xi,t−14 captures a vector of variables related to β(t).
Structural Interpretation. Early in the pandemic, when the number of susceptibles is approximately the same as the entire population, i.e.
0
Sit /Nit ≈ 1, the component Xi,t−14
θ is the projection of infection rate βi (t)
on Xi,t−14 (policy, behavioral, information, and confounders other than testing rate), provided the stochastic component it is orthogonal to Xi,t−14 and
the testing variables:
0
βi (t)Sit /Nit − γ = Xi,t−14
θ + it ,

it ⊥ Xi,t−14 .

The specification for growth rate in deaths as the outcome is motivated by SIRD as
follows. By differentiating (8) and (9) with respect to t and using (10), we obtain
D̈(t)
C̈(t) τ̇ (t)
S(t)
=
−
=
β(t) − γ.
N
Ḋ(t)
Ċ(t) τ (t)

(11)

Our measurement equation for the growth rate of deaths is based on equation (11) but
accounts for a 21 day lag between infection and death as
0
∆ log(∆Dit ) = Xi,t−21
θ + it ,

(M-D)

where
∆ log(∆Dit ) := log(∆Dit ) − log(∆Di,t−7 )

(12)

approximates the weekly growth rate in deaths from t − 7 to t in state i.

3. Empirical Analysis
3.1. Data. Our baseline measures for daily Covid-19 cases and deaths are from The New
York Times (NYT). When there are missing values in NYT, we use reported cases and
deaths from JHU CSSE, and then the Covid Tracking Project. The number of tests for
each state is from Covid Tracking Project. As shown in the lower right panel of Figure 17
in the appendix, there was a rapid increase in testing in the second half of March and then
the number of tests increased very slowly in each state in April.
We use the database on US state policies created by Raifman et al. (2020). In our
analysis, we focus on 6 policies: stay-at-home, closed nonessential businesses, closed K-12
schools, closed restaurants except takeout, closed movie theaters, and face mask mandates
for employees in public facing businesses. We believe that the first four of these policies are
the most widespread and important. Closed movie theaters is included because it captures
common bans on gatherings of more than a handful of people. We also include mandatory
face mask use by employees because its effectiveness on slowing down Covid-19 spread is
a controversial policy issue (Howard et al., 2020; Greenhalgh et al., 2020; Zhang et al.,
2020b). Table 1 provides summary statistics, where N is the number of states that have
ever implemented the policy. We also obtain information on state-level covariates mostly
from Raifman et al. (2020), which include population size, total area, unemployment rate,
poverty rate, a percentage of people who are subject to illness, and state governor’s party
affiliations. These confounders are motivated by Wheaton and Thompson (2020) who find
that case growth is associated with residential density and per capita income.
We obtain social distancing behavior measures from“Google COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports” (LLC, 2020). The dataset provides six measures of “mobility trends” that
report a percentage change in visits and length of stay at different places relative to a
baseline computed by their median values of the same day of the week from January 3

Figure 8 shows the evolution of “Transit stations” and “Workplaces,” where thin lines
are the value in each state and date while thicker colored lines are quantiles conditional on
date. The figures illustrate a sharp decline in people’s movements starting from mid-March
as well as differences in their evolutions across states. They also reveal periodic fluctuations
associated with days of the week, which motivates our use of weekly measures.
In our empirical analysis, we use weekly measures for cases, deaths, and tests by summing
up their daily measures from day t to t − 6. We focus on weekly cases and deaths because
daily new cases and deaths are affected by the timing of reporting and testing and are
quite volatile as shown in the upper right panel of Figure 17 in the appendix. Aggregating
to weekly new cases/deaths/tests smooths out idiosyncratic daily noises as well as periodic
fluctuations associated with days of the week. We also construct weekly policy and behavior
variables by taking 7 day moving averages from day t − 14 to t − 21 for case growth,
where the delay reflects the time lag between infection and case confirmation. The four
weekly behavior variables are referred to “Transit Intensity,” “Workplace Intensity,” “Retail
25The other two measures are “Residential” and “Parks.” We drop “Residential” because it is highly
correlated with “Workplaces” and “Retail & recreation” at correlation coefficients of -0.98 and -0.97, respectively. We also drop “Parks” because it does not have clear implication on the spread of Covid-19.

averages of all variables recorded at daily frequencies. Our sample period is from March 7,
2020 to June 3, 2020.
Table 2 reports that weekly policy and behavior variables are highly correlated with each
other, except for the“masks for employees” policy. High correlations may cause multicolinearity problems and could limit our ability to separately identify the effect of each policy or
behavior variable on case growth. For this reason, we define the “business closure policies”
variable by the average of closed movie theaters, closed restaurants, and closed non-essential
businesses variables and consider a specification that includes business closure policies in
place of these three policy variables separately.
Figure 9 shows the portion of states that have each policy in place at each date. For
most policies, there is considerable variation across states in the time in which the policies
are active. The one exception is K-12 school closures. About 80% of states closed schools
within a day or two of March 15th, and all states closed schools by early April. This makes
the effect of school closings difficult to separate from aggregate time series variation.

3.2. The Effect of Policies and Information on Behavior. We first examine how policies and information affect social distancing behaviors by estimating a version of (PI→B):
j 0
) Wit + εbj
Bitj = (β j )0 Pit + (γ j )0 Iit + (δB
it ,

where Bitj represents behavior variable j in state i at time t. Pit collects the Covid related
policies in state i at t. Confounders, Wit , include state-level covariates, month indicators,
and their interactions. Iit is a set of information variables that affect people’s behaviors at
t. As information, we include each state’s growth of cases (in panel A) or deaths (in panel
B), and log cases or deaths. Additionally, in columns (5)-(8) of Table 3, we include national
growth and log of cases or deaths.
Table 3 reports the estimates with standard errors clustered at the state level. Across
different specifications, our results imply that policies have large effects on behavior. Comparing columns (1)-(4) with columns (5)-(8), the magnitude of policy effects are sensitive
to whether national cases or deaths are included as information. The coefficient on school
closures is particularly sensitive to the inclusion of national information variables. As shown
in Figure 9, there is little variation across states in the timing of school closures. Consequently, it is difficult to separate the effect of school closures from a behavioral response to
the national trend in cases and deaths.
The other policy coefficients are less sensitive to the inclusion of national case/death
variables. After school closures, business closure policies have the next largest effect followed
by stay-at-home orders. The effect of masks for employees is small.26
P
The row “ j Policyj ” reports the sum of the estimated effect of all policies, which is
substantial and can account for a large fraction of the observed declines in behavior variables.
For example, in Figure 8, transit intensity for a median state was approximately -50% at
its lowest point in early April. The estimated policy coefficients in columns imply that
imposing all policies would lead to roughly 75% (in column 4) or roughly 35% (in column
26Similar to our finding, Kovacs, Dunaiski, and Tukiainen (2020) find no evidence that introduction of

compulsory face mask policies affect community mobility in Germany.

8) of the observed decline. The large impact of policies on transit intensity suggests that
the policies may have reduced the Covid-19 infection by reducing people’s use of public
transportation.27
In Table 3(B), estimated coefficients of deaths and death growth are generally negative.
This suggests that the higher number of deaths reduces social interactions measured by
Google Mobility Reports perhaps because people are increasingly aware of prevalence of
Covid-19 (Maloney and Taskin, 2020). The coefficients on log cases and case growth in Table
3(A) are more mixed.28 In columns (5)-(8) of both panels, we see that national case/death
variables have large, negative coefficients. This suggests that behavior responded to national
conditions although it is also likely that national case/death variables capture unobserved
aggregate time effects beyond information which are not fully controlled by month dummies
(e.g., latent policy variables and time-varying confounders that are common across states).

In these figures, red points are the case or death growth rate in states without a mask mandate. Blue points are
states with a mask mandate 14 (21 for deaths) days prior. The red line is the average across states without a mask
mandate 14 (21 for deaths) days earlier. The blue line is the average across states with a mask mandate 14 (21 for
deaths) earlier.

3.3. The Direct Effect of Policies and Behavior on Case and Death Growth. We
now analyze how behavior and policies together influence case and death growth rates. We
begin with some simple graphical evidence of the effect of policies on case and death growth.
Figure 10 shows average case and death growth conditional on date and whether masks are
27Analyzing the New York City’s subway ridership, Harris (2020) finds a strong link between public

transit and spread of infection.

(γ1 + γ2 ) log ∆Cit − γ1 log ∆Ci,t−7 . In columns (1)-(4) of Table 3(A), the estimated values of both (γ1 + γ2 )
and −γ1 are negative except for grocery. This suggests that a higher level of confirmed cases reduces people’s
mobility in workplaces, retails, and transit. For grocery, the positive estimated coefficient of (γ1 + γ2 ) may
reflect stock-piling behavior in early pandemic periods.

mandatory for employees.29 The left panel of the figure shows that states with a mask
mandate consistently have 0-0.2 lower case growth than states without. The right panel
also illustrates that states with a mask mandate tend to have lower average death growth
than states without a mask mandate.
Similar plots are shown for other policies in Figures 20 and 21 in the appendix. The figures
for stay-at-home orders and closure of nonessential businesses are qualitatively similar to
that for masks. States with these two policies appear to have about 0.1 percentage point
lower case growth than states without. The effects of school closures, movie theater closures,
and restaurant closures are not clearly visible in these figures. These figures are merely
suggestive; the patterns observed in them may be driven by confounders.
We more formally analyze the effect of policies by estimating regressions. We first look at
the direct effect of policies on case and death growth conditional on behavior by estimating
equation (BPI→Y):
Yi,t+` = α0 Bit + π 0 Pit + µ0 Iit + δY0 Wit + εyit ,

(13)

where the outcome variable, Yi,t+` , is either case growth or death growth.
For case growth as the outcome, we choose a lag length of ` = 14 days for behavior,
policy, and information variables to reflect the delay between infection and confirmation of
case.30 Bit = (Bit1 , ..., Bit4 )0 is a vector of four behavior variables in state i. Pit includes the
Covid-related policies in state i that directly affect the spread of Covid-19 after controlling
for behavior variables (e.g., masks for employees). We include information variables, Iit ,
that include the past cases and case growths because the past cases may be correlated
with (latent) government policies or people’s behaviors that are not fully captured by our
observed policy and behavior variables. We also consider a specification that includes
the past cases and case growth at the national level as additional information variables.
Wit is a set of confounders that includes month dummies, state-level covariates, and the
interaction terms between month dummies and state-level covariates.31 For case growth,
Wit also includes the test rate growth ∆ log(T )it to capture the effect of changing test rates
on confirmed cases. Equation (13) corresponds to (M-C) derived from the SIR model.
For death growth as the outcome, we take a lag length of ` = 21 days. The information
variables Iit include past deaths and death growth rates; Wit is the same as that of the case
growth equation except that the growth rate of test rates is excluded from Wit as implied
by equation (M-D).
Table 4 shows the results of estimating (13) for case and death growth rates.
29We take 14 and 21 day lags of mask policies for case and death growths, respectively, to identify the

states with a mask mandate because policies affect cases and deaths with time lags. See our discussion in
the Appendix A.6.
30As we review in the Appendix A.6, a lag length of 14 days between exposure and case reporting, as
well as a lag length of 21 days between exposure and deaths, is broadly consistent with currently available
evidence. Section 4 provides a sensitivity analysis under different timing assumptions.
31Month dummies also represent the latent information that is not fully captured by the past cases and
growths.

Dependent variable is the weekly growth rate of confirmed cases (in the left panel) or deaths (in the right panel) as defined in equation (4). The covariates
include
lagged policy and behavior variables, which are constructedP
as 7 day moving averages between t to t − 7 of corresponding daily measures. The row
P
“ j Policiesj ” reports the sum of all policy coefficients. The row “ k wk Behaviork ” reports the sum of four coefficients of behavior variables weighted by the
average of each behavioral variable from April 1st-10th. “business closure policies” is defined by the average of closured movie theaters, closured restaurants,
and closured non-essential businesses. Standard errors are clustered at the state level.

Column (1) represents our baseline specification while column (2) replaces business closure policies with closed movie theaters, closed restaurants, and closed non-essential businesses. Columns (3) and (4) include past cases/deaths and growth rates at national level
as additional regressors.

The estimates indicate that mandatory face masks for employees reduce the growth rate
of infections and deaths by 9-15 percent, while holding behavior constant. This suggests
that requiring masks for employees in public-facing businesses may be an effective preventive
measure.32 The estimated effect of masks on death growth is larger than the effect on case
growth, but this difference between the two estimated effects is not statistically significant.
Closing schools has a large and statistically significant coefficient in the death growth
regressions. As discussed above, however, there is little cross-state variation in the timing
of school closures, making estimates of its effect less reliable.
Neither the effect of stay-at-home orders nor that of business closure policies is estimated
significantly different from zero, suggesting that these lockdown policies may have little
direct effect on case or death growth when behavior is held constant.
P
The row “ k wk Behaviork ” reports the sum of estimated coefficients weighted by the
average
P of the behavioral variables from April 1st-10th. The estimates of −0.80 and −0.84
for “ k wk Behaviork ” in column (1) imply that a reduction in mobility measures relative
to the baseline in January and February have induced a decrease in case and death growth
rates by 80 and 84 percent, respectively, suggesting an importance of social distancing for
reducing the spread of Covid-19. When including national cases and deaths in information,
as shown in columns (3) and (4), the estimated aggregate impact of behavior is substantially
smaller but remains large and statistically significant.
A useful practical implication of these results is that Google Mobility Reports and similar
data might be useful as a leading indicator of potential case or death growth. This should
be done with caution, however, because other changes in the environment might alter the
relationship between behavior and infections. Preventative measures, including mandatory
face masks, and changes in habit that are not captured in our data might alter the future
relationship between Google Mobility Reports and case/death growth.
The negative coefficients of the log of past cases or deaths in Table 4 is consistent with a
hypothesis that higher reported cases and deaths change people’s behavior to reduce transmission risks. Such behavioral changes in response to new information are partly captured
by Google mobility measures, but the negative estimated coefficient of past cases or deaths
32Note that we are not evaluating the effect of universal mask-wearing for the public but that of maskwearing for employees. The effect of universal mask-wearing for the public could be larger if people comply
with such a policy measure. Tian et al. (2020) considered a model in which mask wearing reduces the
reproduction number by a factor (1 − e · pm)2 , where e is the efficacy of trapping viral particles inside the
mask and pm is the percentage of mask-wearing population. Given an estimate of R0 = 2.4, Howard et al.
(2020) argue that 50% mask usage and a 50% mask efficacy level would reduce the reproduction number
from 2.4 to 1.35, an order of magnitude impact.

imply that other latent behavioral changes that are not fully captured by Google mobility
measures (e.g., frequent hand-washing, wearing masks, and keeping 6ft/2m distancing) are
also important for reducing future cases and deaths.
If policies are enacted and behavior changes, then future cases/deaths and information
will change, which will induce further behavior changes. However, since the model includes
lags of cases/deaths as well as their growth rates, computing a long-run effect is not completely straightforward. We investigate dynamic effects that incorporate feedback through
information in section 5.
3.4. The Total Effect of Policies on Case Growth. In this section, we focus our
analysis on policy effects when we hold information constant. The estimated effect of policy
on behavior in Table 3 and those of policies and behavior on case/death growth in Table
4 can be combined to calculate the total effect of policy as well as its decomposition into
direct and indirect effects.
The first three columns of Table 6 show the direct (holding behavior constant) and
indirect (through behavior changes) effects of policy under a specification that excludes
national information variables. These are computed from the specification with national
cases or deaths included as information (columns (1)-(4) of Table 3 and column (1) of Table
4). The estimates imply that all policies combined would reduce the growth rate of cases
and deaths by 0.69 and 0.90, respectively, out of which more than one-half to two-third
is attributable to the indirect effect through their impact on behavior. The estimate also
indicates that the effect of mandatory masks for employees is mostly direct.
We can also examine the total effect of policies and information on case or death growth,
by estimating (PI→Y). The coefficients on policy in this regression combine both the direct
and indirect effects.
Table 5 shows the full set of coefficient estimates for (PI→Y). The results are broadly
consistent with what we found above. As in Table 3, the effect of school closures is sensitive
to the inclusion of national information variables. Also as above, mask mandates have a
significant negative effect on growth rates.
Similarly to Table 6, the first three columns of Table 7 report the estimated direct and
indirect effects of policy but impose that masks for employees only affect cases/deaths
directly without affecting behavior and that business closure policies only affect cases/deaths
indirectly through their effects on behavior.33 The estimated total effect of masks for
employees in the third column of Table 7 is higher than that of Table 6. Similarly, the total
effect of business closure policies is estimated to be larger in Table 7 than in Table 6.
Column “Difference” in Tables 6 and 7 show the difference between the estimate of
(PI→Y) in column “PI→Y Coefficient” and the implied estimate from (BPI→Y)-(PI→B)
33These are computed from estimating the specification in columns (1)-(4) of Table 3 and column (1) of
Table 4 but imposing that the coefficient of masks for employees is zero in (BPI→Y) and that the coefficient
of business closure policies is zero in (PI→B).

Direct effects capture the effect of policy on case growth holding behavior, information, and confounders constant. Direct
effects are given by π in equation (BPI→Y). Indirect effects capture how policy changes behavior and behavior shift case
growth. They are given by α from (BPI→Y) times β from (PI→B). The total effect is π + βα. Column “PI→Y
Coefficients” shows the coefficient estimates from PI→Y. Columns “Difference” are the differences between the estimates
from (PI→Y) and the combination of (BPI→Y) and (PI→B) while column “Average” are their averages. Standard errors
are computed by bootstrap and clustered on state.

Direct effects capture the effect of policy on case growth holding behavior, information, and confounders constant. Direct
effects are given by π in equation (BPI→Y). Indirect effects capture how policy changes behavior and behavior shift case
growth. They are given by α from (BPI→Y) times β from (PI→B). The total effect is π + βα. Column “PI→Y
Coefficients” shows the coefficient estimates from PI→Y. Columns “Difference” are the differences between the estimates
from (PI→Y) and the combination of (BPI→Y) and (PI→B) while column “Average” are their averages. Standard errors
are computed by bootstrap and clustered on state.

Direct effects capture the effect of policy on case growth holding behavior, information, and confounders constant.
Direct effects are given by π in equation (BPI→Y). Indirect effects capture how policy changes behavior and
behavior shift case growth. They are given by α from (BPI→Y) times β from (PI→B). The total effect is π + βα.
Column “PI→Y Coefficients” shows the coefficient estimates from PI→Y. Columns “Difference” are the differences
between the estimates from (PI→Y) and the combination of (BPI→Y) and (PI→B) while column “Average” are
their averages. Standard errors are computed by bootstrap and clustered on state.

in column “Total.” Differences are generally small except for the coefficient of closed K-12
schools and the sum of all policies in Table 6. The large differences in school closures may be
due to the difficulty in identifying the effect of school closures given a lack of cross-sectional
variation. Imposing the coefficients of masks for employees and business closure policies
to be zero in (BPI→Y) and (PI→B), respectively, does not increase differences between
“Total” and “PI→Y Coefficient” as reported in the last column of Table 7.
Tables 8 and 9 present the results for a specification that includes national information
variables, where the estimates on masks for employees are similar to those in Tables 6 and 7.
Column “Difference” of Table 9 indicates that the restrictions of zero coefficients for masks
for employees in (BPI→Y) and for business closure policies in (PI→B) are not statistically
rejected.
Column “Average” of Tables 6 and 8 reports the average of “Total” and “PI→Y Coefficient” columns. The average is an appealing and simple way to combine the two estimates
of the total effect: one relying on the causal structure and another inferred from a direct
estimation of equation (PI → Y). We shall be using the average estimate in generating the
counterfactuals in the next section. Turning to the results, the estimates of Tables 6 and
8 imply that all policies combined would reduce ∆ log ∆D by 0.93 and 0.39, respectively.
For comparison, the median of ∆ log ∆Dit reached its peak in mid-March of about 1.3 (see
Figure 18 in the appendix). Since then it has declined to near 0. Therefore, -0.93 and -0.39
imply that policy changes can account for roughly one-third to two-third of the observed
decrease in death growth. The remainder of the decline is likely due to changes in behavior
from information.
4. Sensitivity Analysis
4.1. Specifications, Timings, and Flexible Controls via Machine Learning. In this
section, we provide sensitivity analysis by estimating (PI→Y) with alternative specifications
and methods. Figure 11 shows the 90% confidence intervals of coefficients of (A) masks for
employees, (B) closed K-12 school, (C) stay-at-home, and (D) the average variable of closed
movie theaters, closed restaurants, and closed non-essential businesses for the following
specifications and estimation methods:
(1) Baseline specification in columns (1) and (3) of Table 5.
(2) Exclude the state of New York from the sample because it may be viewed as an
outlier in the early pandemic period.
(3) Add the percentage of people who wear masks to protect themselves in March and
April as a confounder for unobserved personal risk-aversion and initial attitude
toward mask wearing.34
(4) Add the log of Trump’s vote share in the 2016 presidential election as a confounder
for unobserved private behavioral response.
34The survey is conducted online by YouGov and is based on the interviews of 89,347 US adults aged 18
and over between March 26-April 29, 2020. The survey question is “Which, if any, of the following measures
have you taken in the past 2 weeks to protect yourself from the Coronavirus (COVID-19)?”.

36

(5) Add past behavior variables as information used to set policies. Under this specification, our causal interpretation is valid when policy variables are sufficiently random
conditional on past behavior variables.
(6) Include all additional controls in (3)-(5) with the sample that excludes New York
as in (2).
(7) Add weekly dummies to the baseline specification.
(8) Baseline specification estimated by instrumenting ∆ log Tit with one week lagged
logarithm value of the number of tests per 1000 people.
(9) Estimated by Double Machine Learning (DML) (e.g., Chernozhukov et al., 2018)
with Lasso to reduce dimensionality while including all additional controls in (3)-(5).
(10) Estimated by DML with Random Forest to reduce dimensionality and capture some
nonlinearities while including all additional controls in (3)-(5).
In Figure 11, “red”, “green”, “blue”, and “purple” indicate the regression models for case
growth without national information variables, case growth with national information variables, death growth without national information variables, and death growth with national
information variables, respectively. The left panel of “(i) baseline timing” assume that the
times from exposure to case confirmation and death reporting are 14 and 21 days, respectively, while they are 7 and 24 days, respectively, in the right panel of “(ii) alternative
timing.”35
Panel (A) of Figure 11 illustrates that the estimated coefficients of mask mandates are
negative and significant in most specifications, methods, and timing assumptions, confirming
the importance of mask policy on reducing case and death growths.
In Panel (B) of Figure 11, many estimates of closures of K-12 schools suggest that the
effect of school closures is large. The visual evidence on growth rates for states with and
without school closures in Figure 12 also suggests that there may be a potentially large
effect, though the history is very short. This evidence is consistent with the emerging
evidence of prevalence of Covid-19 among children (Lee et al., 2020b; Szablewski et al.,
2020). Davies et al. (2020) find that although children’s transmission and susceptibility
rates are half that of ages 20-30, children’s contact rates are much higher. This type of
evidence, as well as, evidence that children carry viral loads similar to older people (Jones
et al. (2020)), led Germany to make the early decision of closing schools.
Our estimates of school closures substantially vary across specifications, however. In particular, the estimated effects of school closures on case/death growth become notably smaller
once national cases/deaths or weekly dummies are controlled for. In the US state-level data,
there is little variation across states in the timing of school closures. Consequently, its estimate is particularly sensitive to an inclusion of some aggregate variables such as national
cases or weekly dummies. Given this sensitivity, there still exists a lot of uncertainty as to
35This alternative timing assumption is motivated by the lower bound estimate of median times from expo-

sure to case confirmation or death reporting in Table 2 of https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/
hcp/planning-scenarios.html, which are based on data received by CDC through June 29, 2020. We
thank C. Jessica E. Metcalf for recommending us to do a sensitivity analysis on the timing assumption while
suggesting this reference to us.

CAUSAL IMPACT OF MASKS, POLICIES, BEHAVIOR

37

the magnitude of the effect of school closures. Any analyses of re-opening plans need to be
aware of this uncertainty. An important research question is how to resolve this uncertainty
using additional data sources.
Panel (C) of Figure 11 indicates that the estimated coefficients of stay-at-home orders
are generally negative and often significant, providing evidence that stay-at-home orders
reduce the spread of COVID-19, although the estimates are sometimes sensitive to timing
assumptions. Panel (D) shows that the estimated coefficients of business closure policies
substantially vary across specifications, providing a mixed evidence for the effect of closures
of businesses on case/death growth.
4.2. Fixed Effects Specification. Table 10 presents the results of estimating (PI→Y)
with state fixed effects and weekly dummies. Because fixed effects estimator could be
substantially biased when the time dimension is relatively short, we report not only the
standard fixed effects estimator in columns (1) and (3) but also the debiased fixed effects
estimator (e.g., Chen, Chernozhukov, and Fernández-Val, 2019) in columns (2) and (4),
where the state-level clustered bootstrap standard errors are reported in all columns.
The estimated coefficients of masks for employees largely confirm our finding that mandatory mask policies reduce the case and death growths. The estimated coefficients of stay-athome orders and business closures are negative in columns (1) and (2) but their magnitudes
as well as statistical significance are somewhat sensitive to whether bias corrections are
applied or not.
The results in Table 10 should be interpreted with caution. The fixed effects approach
may not be preferred to random effects approach here because the former relies on long
time and cross-sectional histories but, in our data, the effective time-dimension is short and
the number of states is not large. Furthermore, the fixed effects approach could suffer more
from measurement errors, which could be a concern for our behavior and policy variables.

5. Empirical Evaluation of Counterfactual Policies
We now turn our focus to dynamic feedback effects. Policy and behavior changes that
reduce case and death growth today can lead to a more optimistic, riskier behavior in the
future, attenuating longer run effects. We perform the main counterfactual experiments
using the average of two estimated coefficients as reported in column “Average” of Table
7 under a specification that excludes the number of past national cases and deaths from
information variables and constrains masks to have only direct effects and business policies
only indirect effects.36 Details of the counterfactual computations are in appendix A.10.

The vertical text denotes the dates that Washington imposed each policy. To compute the estimated and
counterfactual paths we use the average of two estimated coefficients as reported in column “Average” of
Table 7. We set initial ∆ log ∆C and log ∆C to their values first observed in the state we are simulating.
We hold all other regressors at their observed values. The shaded region is a point-wise 90% confidence
interval. See appendix A.10 for more details.

5.1. Business Mask Mandate. We first consider the impact of a nationwide mask mandate for employees beginning on March 14th. As discussed earlier, we find that mask
mandates reduce case and death growth even when holding behavior constant. In other
words, mask mandates may reduce infections with relatively little economic disruption.
This makes mask mandates a particularly attractive policy instrument. In this section we
36Results (not shown) using the unconstrained estimates in Table 6 are very similar.

CAUSAL IMPACT OF MASKS, POLICIES, BEHAVIOR

examine what would have happened to the number of cases if all states had imposed a mask
mandate on March 14th.37
For illustrative purpose, we begin by focusing on Washington State. The left column
of Figure 13 shows the change in growth rate from mandating masks on March 14th. The
shaded region is a 90% pointwise confidence interval. As shown, mandating masks on March
14th lowers the growth of cases or deaths 14 or 21 days later by 0.07 or 0.14. This effect
then gradually declines due to information feedback. Mandatory masks reduce past cases
or deaths, which leads to less cautious behavior, attenuating the impact of the policy. The
reversal of the decrease in growth in late May is due to our comparison of a mask mandate
on March 14th with Washington’s actual mask mandate in early May. By late May, the
counterfactual mask effect has decayed through information feedback, and we are comparing
it to the undecayed impact of Washington’s actual, later mask mandate.
The middle column of Figure 13 shows how the changes in case and death growth translate
into changes in daily cases and deaths. The estimates imply that mandating masks on March
14th would have led to about 70 fewer cases and 5 fewer deaths per day throughout April
and May. Cumulatively, this implies 19% [9, 29]% fewer cases and 26% [14, 37]% fewer
deaths in Washington by the start of June.
The results for other states are similar to those for Washington. Figure 14 shows the
national effect of mask mandate on March 14th. The top panel shows the effect on cases
and the bottom panel shows the effect on deaths. The left column shows the change in
growth rates. Dots are the average change in growth rate in each state (i.e. the dots are
identical to the solid line in the left panel of Figure 13, except for each state instead of just
Washington). The solid blue line is the national average change in growth rate. The shaded
region is a 90% pointwise confidence band for the national average change in growth rate.
The middle column shows the changes in cases and deaths per day. Dots are the expected
change in each state. The thick line is the national total change in daily cases or deaths.
The shaded region is a pointwise 90% confidence band for the national total change. The
estimates that a mask mandate in mid March would have decreased cases and deaths by
about 6000 and 600 respectively throughout April and May.
The right column of Figure 14 shows how these daily changes compare to the total cumulative cases and deaths. The right column shows the national relative change in cumulative
cases or deaths. The point estimates indicate that mandating masks on March 14th could
have led to 21% fewer cumulative cases and 34% fewer deaths by the end of May with
their 90 percent intervals given by [9, 32]% and [19, 47]%, respectively. The result roughly
translates into 19 to 47 thousand saved lives.

37We feel this is a plausible counterfactual policy. Many states began implement business restrictions and

school closures in mid March. In a paper made publicly available on April 1st, Abaluck et al. (2020) argued
for mask usage based on comparisons between countries with and without pre-existing norms of widespread
mask usage.

In the left column, the dots are the average change in growth in each state. The blue line is the average
across states of the change in growth. The shaded region is a point-wise 90% confidence interval for the
national average change in growth. The middle column shows the total national change in daily cases and
deaths. Black dots are the changes in each state. The right column shows the change in cumulative cases
or deaths relative to the baseline of actual policies.

5.2. Business Closure Policies. Business closures are particularly controversial. We
now examine a counterfactual where there are no business closure policies (no restaurant,
movie theater, or non-essential business closure). Figure 15 shows the national effect of
never restricting businesses on cases and deaths. The point estimates imply that, without
business closures, cases and deaths would be about 40% higher at the end of May. The
confidence intervals are wide. A 90 percent confidence interval for the increase in cases at
the end of May is [17, 78]%. The confidence interval for deaths is even wider, [1, 97]%.
5.3. Stay-at-home orders. We next examine a counterfactual where stay-at-home orders
had been never issued. Figure 16 shows the national effect of no stay-at-home orders. On
average, without stay-at-home orders, case growth rate would have been nearly 0.075 higher
in late April. This translates to 37% [6, 63]% more cases per week by the start of June.
The estimated effect for deaths is a bit smaller, with no increase included in a 90 percent
confidence interval, [−7, 50]%.

6. Conclusion
This paper assesses the effects of policies on the spread of Covid-19 in the US using statelevel data on cases, tests, policies, and social distancing behavior measures from Google
Mobility Reports. Our findings are summarized as follows.
First, our empirical analysis robustly indicates that mandating face masks has reduced
the spread of Covid-19 without affecting people’s social distancing behavior measured by
Google Mobility Reports. Our counterfactual experiment suggests that if all states had
adopted mandatory face mask policies on March 14th of 2020, then the cumulative number
of deaths by the end of May would have been smaller by as much as 19 to 47%, which
roughly translates into 19 to 47 thousand saved lives.
Second, our baseline counterfactual analysis suggests that keeping all businesses open
would have led to 17 to 78% more cases while not implementing stay-at-home orders would
have increased cases by 6 to 63% by the end of May although we should interpret these
numbers with some caution given that the estimated effect of business closures and stayat-home orders vary across specifications in our sensitivity analysis.
Third, we find considerable uncertainty over the impact of school closures on case or
death growth because it is difficult to identify the effect of school closures from the US
state-level data due to the lack of variation in the timing of school closures across states.
Fourth, our analysis shows that people voluntarily reduce their visits to workplace, retail stores, grocery stores, and people limit their use of public transit when they receive
information on a higher number of new cases and deaths. This suggests that individuals
make decisions to voluntarily limit their contact with others in response to greater transmission risks, leading to an important feedback mechanism that affects future cases and
deaths. Model simulations that ignore this voluntary behavioral response to information on
transmission risks would over-predict the future number of cases and deaths.
Beyond these findings, our paper presents a useful conceptual framework to investigate
the relative roles of policies and information on determining the spread of Covid-19 through
their impact on people’s behavior. Our causal model allows us to explicitly define counterfactual scenarios to properly evaluate the effect of alternative policies on the spread of
Covid-19. More broadly, our causal framework can be useful for quantitatively analyzing
not only health outcomes but also various economic outcomes (Bartik et al., 2020; Chetty
et al., 2020).

Appendix A. Data Construction
A.1. Measuring ∆C and ∆ log ∆C. We have three data sets with information on daily
cumulative confirmed cases in each state. As shown in Table 11, these cumulative case
numbers are very highly correlated. However, Table 12 shows that the numbers are different
more often than not.

Table 12. Portion of cumulative cases that are equal between data sets
The upper left panel of Figure 17 shows the evolution of new cases in the NYT data,
where daily changes in cumulative cases exhibit some excessive volatility. This is likely due
to delays and bunching in testing and reporting of results. Table 13 shows the variance
of log new cases in each data set, as well as their correlations. As shown, the correlations
are approximately 0.9. The NYT new case numbers have the lowest variance.38 In our
subsequent results, we will primarily use the case numbers from The New York Times.

Table 13. Correlation and variance of log daily new cases
For most of our results, we focus on new cases in a week instead of in a day. We do this
for two reasons as discussed in the main text. First, a decline in new cases over two weeks
has become a key metric for decision makers. Secondly, aggregating to weekly new cases
smooths out the noise associated with the timing of reporting and testing.
Table 14 reports the correlation and variance of weekly log new cases across the three
data sets. The upper right panel of Figure 17 shows the evolution of weekly new cases in
38This comparison is somewhat sensitive to how you handle negative and zero cases when taking logs.
Here, we replaced log(0) with −1. In our main results, we work with weekly new cases, which are very rarely
zero.

This figure shows the evolution of Google Mobility Reports over time. Thin gray lines are the value of the
variables in each state and date. Thicker colored lines are quantiles of the variables conditional on date.

A.5. Policy Variables. We use the database on US state policies created by Raifman
et al. (2020). As discussed in the main text, our analysis focuses on six policies. For
stay-at-home orders, closed nonessential businesses, closed K-12 schools, closed restaurants
except takeout, and closed movie theaters, we double-checked any state for which Raifman
et al. (2020) does not record a date. We filled in a few missing dates. Our modified data is
available here. Our modifications fill in 1 value for school closures, 2 for stay-at-home orders,
3 for movie theater closure, and 4 for non-essential business closures. Table 16 displays all 25
dated policy variables in Raifman et al. (2020)’s database with our modifications described
above.
Figures 20-21 show the average case and death growth conditional on date and whether
each of six policies is implemented or not.
A.6. Timing. There is a delay between infection and when a person is tested and appears
in our case data. MIDAS (2020) maintain a list of estimates of the duration of various
stages of Covid-19 infections. The incubation period, the time from infection to symptom
onset, is widely believed to be 5 days. For example, using data from Wuhan, Li et al. (2020)

estimate a mean incubation period of 5.2 days. Siordia (2020) reviews the literature and
concludes the mean incubation period is 3-9 days.

Estimates of the time between symptom onset and case reporting or death are less common. Using Italian data, Cereda et al. (2020) estimate an average of 7.3 days between
symptom onset and reporting. Zhang et al. (2020a) find an average of 7.4 days using Chinese data from December to early February, but they find this period declined from 8.9
days in January to 5.4 days in the first week of February. Both of these papers on time
from symptom onset to reporting have large confidence intervals covering approximately 1
to 20 days.
Studying publicly available data on infected persons diagnosed outside of Wuhan, Linton
et al. (2020) estimate an average of 15 days from onset to death. Similarly, using publicly
available reports of 140 confirmed Covid-19 cases in China, mostly outside Hubei Province,
Sanche et al. (2020) estimate the time from onset to death to be 16.1 days.
Based on the above, we expect a delay of roughly two weeks between changes in behavior
or policies, and changes in reported cases while a corresponding delay of roughly three weeks
for deaths.

A.7. Direct and Indirect Policy Effects with national case/death variables. Tables
8 and 9 present the estimates of direct and indirect effects of policies for the specification
with past national case/death variables. The effects of school closures and the sum of
policies are estimated substantially smaller in Table 8 when national case/death variables are
included than in Table 6. This sensitivity reflects the difficulty in identifying the aggregate
time effect—which is largely captured by national cases/deaths—given little cross-sectional
variation in the timing of school closures across states. On the other hand, the estimated
effects of policies other than school closures are similar between Table 6 and Table 8; the
effect of other policies are well-identified from cross-sectional variations.

A.8. Double Machine Learning. To estimate the coefficient of the j-th policy variable,
Pitj , using double machine learning (Chernozhukov et al. (2018)), we consider a version of
(PI→Y) as follows:
Yi,t+` = Pitj θ0 + φ0 Xit + g0 (Wit ) + ξit ,
Pitj = ψ 0 Xit + m0 (Wit ) + Vit ,

E[ξit |Pitj , Xit , Wit ] = 0,
E[Vit |Xit , Wit ] = 0,

where Xit = ((Pit−j )0 , Bit0 , Iit0 )0 collects policy variables except for the j-th policy variables
Pit−j , behavior variables Bit , and information variables Iit . The confounding factors Wit
affect the policy variable Pitj via the function m0 (W ) and the outcome variable Yi,t+` via
the function g0 (W ). We apply Lasso or Random Forests to estimate g0 (W ) for dimension
reductions or for capturing non-linearity while the coefficients of Xit are estimated under
linearity without imposing any dimension reductions. We omit the details of estimation

procedure here. Please see the discussion in Example 1.1 of Chernozhukov et al. (2018) for
reference.
A.9. Debiased Fixed Effects Estimator. We apply cross-over Jackknife bias correction
as discussed in Chen et al. (2020) in details. Here, we briefly describe our debiased fixed
effects estimator.
Given our panel data with N = 51 states and T = 75 days for case growth equation
(PI→Y), consider two subpanels as follows:
S1 = {(i, t) : i ≤ dN/2e, t ≤ dT /2e} ∪ {(i, t) : i ≥ bN/2 + 1c, t ≥ bT /2 + 1c}
and
S2 = {(i, t) : i ≤ dN/2e, t ≥ bT /2 + 1c} ∪ {(i, t) : i ≥ bN/2 + 1c, t ≤ dT /2e}
where d.e and b.c are the ceiling and floor functions. Each of these two subpanels includes
observations for all cross-sectional units and time periods.
We form the debiased fixed effects estimator as
βbBC = 2βb − βeS

1 ∪S2

,

where βb is the standard fixed effects estimator while βeS1 ∪S2 denotes the fixed effects estimator using the data set S1 ∪ S2 but treats the states in S1 differently from those in S2 to form
the fixed effects estimator; namely, we include approximately twice more state fixed effects
to compute βeS1 ∪S2 .39 We obtain bootstrap standard errors by using multipler bootstrap
with state-level clustering.
A.10. Details for Computing Counterfactuals . We compute counterfactuals from the
“total effect” version of the model, with behavior concentrated out.
Yi,t+` = a0 Pit + b0 Iit + δ̃ 0 Wit + ε̄it
We consider a counterfactual change of Pit to Pit? , while Wit and ε̄it are held constant. In
?
response to the policy change, Yi,t+` and the part of Iit that contains Yit , change to Yi,t+`
?
and Iit . To be specific, let Cit denote cumulative cases in state i on day t. Our outcome is:
Yi,t+` ≡ log (Ci,t+` − Ci,t+`−7 ) − log (Ci,t+`−7 − Ci,t+`−14 ) ≡ ∆ log ∆Ci,t+`
where ∆ is a 7 day difference operator. Writing the model in terms of ∆ log ∆C we have:
∆ log ∆Ci,t+` = a0 Pit + bD ∆ log ∆Ci,t + bL log ∆Ci,t + δ̃ 0 Wit + ε̄it
To simplify computation, we rewrite this model in terms of log ∆C:
log ∆Ci,t+` = a0 Pit + log ∆Ci,t+`−7 + (bD + bL ) log ∆Ci,t − bD log ∆Ci,t−7 + δ̃ 0 Wit + ε̄it
?
This equation is used to iteratively compute log ∆Ci,t+`
conditional on initial {log ∆Ci,s }0s=−`−7 ,
? , ε̄ }T .
and the entire sequence of {Wi,t , Pi,t
it t=0
39Alternatively, we may form the cross-over jackknife corrected estimator as β
bCBC = 2βb − (βeS + βeS )/2,

2

where βeSj denotes the fixed effect estimator using the subpanel Sj for j = 1, 2. In our empirical analysis,
these two cross-over jackknife bias corrected estimators give similar result.

Weekly cases instead of log weekly cases are given simply by
?
?
∆Ci,t+`
= exp(log ∆Ci,t+`
)

Cumulative cases can be recursively computed as:
Ci,t = Ci,t−7 + ∆Ci,t = Ci,t−7 + exp(log ∆Ci,t )
given initial

{Ci,s }0s=−7 .

?
Note that log ∆Ci,t+`
depends linearly on ε̄, so the residuals (and our decision to condition
on versus integrate them out) do not matter when considering linear constasts of log ∆Cit
or ∆ log ∆Cit , or when considering relative contrasts of ∆Cit .

Inference. Let S(θ, ε) denote some counterfactual quantity or contrast of interest, where
θ = (a, b, δ̃) are the parameters, and ε is the vector of residuals. Examples of S that we
compute include:
• Contrasts of growth rates: S(θ, ε) = ∆ log ∆Cit? − ∆ log ∆Cit
• Relative contrasts of weekly cases: S(θ, ε) = ∆Cit? /∆Cit
C ? −C
• Relative contrasts of cumulative cases: S(θ, ε) = itCit it
The first two examples do not actually depend on ε, but the third one does. Inference is
by simulation. Let θ̂ denote our point estimates and ε̂ the associated residuals. We draw
θ̃j from the asymptotic distribution of θ̂. Let ε̃j denote the residuals associated with θ̃j .
We then compute s̃j = S(θ̃j , ε̃j ) for j = 1, ..., 200 and plots the mean across j as a point
estimate and quantiles across j for confidence intervals.
