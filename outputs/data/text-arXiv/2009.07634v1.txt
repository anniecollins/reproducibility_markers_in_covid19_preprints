Abstract
Count-valued time series data are routinely collected in many application areas. We are
particularly motivated to study the count time series of daily new cases, arising from COVID19 spread. First, we propose a Bayesian framework to study time-varying semiparametric
AR(p) model for count and then extend it to propose a time-varying INGARCH model
considering the rapid changes in the spread. We calculate posterior contraction rates of
the proposed Bayesian methods with respect to average Hellinger metric. Our proposed
structures of the models are amenable to Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampling for
efficient computation. We substantiate our methods by simulations that show superiority
compared to some of the close existing methods. Finally we analyze the daily time series
data of newly confirmed cases to study its spread through different government interventions.

Introduction

Modeling count time series is important in many applications such as disease incidence, accident
rates, integer financial datasets such as price movement, etc. This relatively new research stream
was introduced in Zeger (1988) and interestingly he analyzed another outbreak namely the US
1970 Polio incidence rate. This stream was furthered by Chan and Ledolter (1995) where Poisson
generalized linear models (GLM) with an autoregressive latent process in the mean are discussed.
A wide range of dependence was explored in Davis et al. (2003) for simple autoregressive (AR)
structure and external covariates. On the other hand, a different stream explored integer-valued
time series counts such as ARMA structures as in (Brandt and Williams, 2001; Biswas and Song,
1

2009) or INGARCH structure as done in Zhu (2011, 2012c,a,b). However, from a Bayesian perspective, the only work to the best of our knowledge is that of Silveira de Andrade et al. (2015)
where the authors discussed an ARMA model for different count series parameters. However,
their treatment of ignoring zero-valued data or putting the MA structure by demeaned Poisson
random variable remains questionable. None of these works focused on the time-varying nature
of the coefficients except for a brief mention in Karmakar et al. (2020+).
Our goals are motivated by both the application and methodological development. To the
best of our knowledge, ours is the first attempt to model possibly autoregressive count time series
with time-varying coefficients which can be regarded as the time-varying analog of Fokianos et al.
(2009). We tend to avoid the usual GLM route having exponential link such as Fokianos and
Tjøstheim (2011) since it looses the interpretability of the functions. On the contrary, we impose
shape restrictions on the coefficient functions. The mean function stands for the overall spread and
the autoregressive coefficients stand for the effect of different lags. We are particularly motivated
to study the spread of COVID-19 in New York City (NYC) from 23rd January to 14th July using
the daily count data of new cases. In terms of our motivating data application, we wish to identify
which lags are significant in our model which can be directly linked to the period of time symptoms
did not show up. We find that some higher-order lags like 6, 7, and 8 are also significant. These
findings are in-line with several research articles discussing the incubation length for the novel
coronavirus with a median of 6-7 days and 98% below 11 days. For example, see Lauer et al.
(2020b). We also find that after the lockdown or stay-at-home orders it takes about 12-16 days
to reach the peak and then the intercept coefficient function starts decreasing. This is also an
interesting find which characterizes the fact that the number of infected but asymptomatic cases
is large compared to the new cases reported. Additional to the time-varying AR model proposal,
we also offer an analysis via a TVBINGARCH model that assumes an additional recursive term in
the conditional expectation (cf. (2.7)). This extension offers some more comprehensiveness in the
modeling part as even BINGARCH with small orders can help us get rid of choosing an appropriate
maximum lag value. Since for a Poisson model, the mean is the same as the variance, this can also
be thought of as an extension of the GARCH model in the context of count data. First introduced
by Ferland et al. (2006), these models were thoroughly analyzed in Zhu (2012c,a, 2011, 2012b);
Ahmad and Francq (2016). Our proposal for the time-varying TVBINGARCH model adapts to

2

the non-stationarity theme and also can be viewed as a new contribution. Finally, we contrast the
time-varying AR and the GARCH for both simulations and real-data applications under different
metrics of evaluation.
In our present context, the number of affected can be covered by the popular SIR model in
this case, however, they assume additional structure on how these numbers evolve and then tries
to estimate the rate. Instead, we do not assume any such specific evolution and offer a general
perspective of how the trend behaves. This can shed light on how external factors played a role.
Given the rapidly evolving nature of the pandemic, the patterns and number of new affected cases
are changing rapidly over different geographical regions. The rapid change in the observed counts
make all earlier time-constant analysis inappropriate and builds a path where we can explore
methodological and inferential development in tracking down the trajectory of this spread. Thus,
we propose a novel semiparametric time-varying autoregressive model for counts to study the
spread and examine the effects of these interventions in the spread based on the time-varying
coefficient functions. A time-varying AR(p) process consists of a time-varying mean/intercept
function along with time-varying autoregressive coefficient functions. We further generalize it to
a time-varying Bayesian integer-valued generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity
(TVBINGARCH) model where the conditional mean depends also on the past conditional means.
Regression models with varying coefficient were introduced by Hastie and Tibshirani (1993).
They modeled the varying coefficients using cubic B-splines. Later, these models has been further
explored in various directions Gu and Wahba (1993); Biller and Fahrmeir (2001); Fan and Zhang
(2008); Franco-Villoria et al. (2019); Yue et al. (2014). Spline bases have been routinely used to
model the time-varying coefficients within non-linear time series models (Cai et al., 2000; Huang
et al., 2002; Huang and Shen, 2004; Amorim et al., 2008). We also consider the B-spline series
based priors to model the time-varying coefficient functions. We develop efficient computational
algorithms for the proposed models. Apart from developing a computationally tractable hierarchical model, we also establish posterior contraction rates of the proposed models. To the best of
our knowledge, the posterior contraction rate result of this paper is the first for the time-varying
Markov model based on minimal assumptions under Poisson-link. Our posterior contraction rate
is with respect to the average Hellinger metric. The primary theoretical hurdle is to construct
exponentially consistent tests in a time-varying Markov setup. Our proposed test construction is

3

inspired by Jeong et al. (2019); Ning et al. (2020). We construct the test relying on the NeymanPearson lemma with respect to negative average log affinity distance and calculate contraction
rates. Then we show that the same rate holds for the average Hellinger metric as well. We also
discuss a pointwise inferential tool by drawing credible intervals. Such tools are important to
keep an objective perspective in terms of the evolution of the time-varying coefficients without
restricting it to some specific trend models. See Karmakar et al. (2020+) (Karmakar (2018) for
an earlier version) for a comprehensive discussion on time-varying models and their applications.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the proposed Bayesian
models in detail. Section 3 discusses an efficient computational scheme for the proposed method.
We calculate posterior contraction rates in Section 4. The performance of our proposed method in
capturing true coefficient functions are studied in Section 5 and we show excellent performance over
other existing methods. Section 6 deals with an application of the proposed method on COVID19 spread for NYC. Then, we end with discussions and possible future directions in Section 7.
Section 8 contains detail theoretical proofs.

Modeling

In this paper, our motivating data is the daily count of newly confirmed cases of COVID-19 of
New York City (NYC). Figure 1 illustrates the logarithm of the absolute values of fitted residuals
for different methods on the COVID-19 spread data. We find that the time-varying AR (tvAR)
model fits the data much better than other routinely used time-constant methods. Given the
current knowledge of the incubation period of the virus (Lauer et al., 2020a), we fit models until
lag 10 for the autoregressive part. For the conditional heteroscedastic models, we consider the
order as (1,1), which is a standard choice for such models. This motivates us to consider the
non-stationary time-series models such as usual tvAR regression. However, we emphasize that
these existing methods are suitable only for continuous-valued variables and not for count-valued
series.
This motivation sets up the stage to discuss Poisson autoregression with time-varying coefficients. Let {Xt } be a count-valued time series. In this paper, we consider two different structures
for the conditional mean of {Xt } given the history of the process. The first modeling framework
is in the spirit of time-varying auto-regressive models. Next, we consider a more general modeling

structure adding an additional recursive term in the intensity parameter.

2.1

Time-varying auto-regressive model for counts

The linear Poisson autoregressive model (Zeger, 1988; Brandt and Williams, 2001) is popular
in analyzing count valued time series. Due to the assumed non-stationary nature of the data,
we propose a time-varying version of this model. The conditional distribution for count-valued
time-series Xt given Ft−1 = {Xi : i ≤ (t − 1)} is,
Xt |Ft−1 ∼Poisson(λt ) where λt = µ(t/T ) +

p
X

ai (t/T )Xt−i .

(2.1)

i=1

We call our method time-varying Bayesian Auto Regressive model for Counts (TVBARC). The
rescaling of the time-varying parameters to the support [0,1] is usual for in-filled asymptotics.
Due to the Poisson link in (2.1), both conditional mean and conditional variance depend on the
past observations. The conditional expectation of Xt in the above model (2.1) is E(Xt |Ft−1 ) =
P
µ(t/T ) + pi=1 ai (t/T )Xt−i , which needs to be positive-valued. To ensure that, we impose the

5

following constraints on parameter space for the time-varying parameters,
P1 = {µ, ai : µ(x) > 0, 0 ≤ ai (x) ≤ 1, sup

ak (x) < 1}.

Note that, the conditions imposed (2.2) on the parameters are somewhat motivated by the stationarity conditions for the time-constant versions of these models. This is not uncommon in
time-varying AR literature. See Dahlhaus and Subba Rao (2006); Fryzlewicz et al. (2008); Karmakar et al. (2020+) for example. Even though the condition on µ(·) seem restrictive in the
light of what we need for invertible time-constant AR(p) process with Gaussian error, it is not
unusual when it is used to model variance parameters to ensure positivity; it was unanimously
imposed for all the literature mentioned above. Additionally, the above references heavily depend
on local stationarity: namely, for every rescaled time 0 < t < 1, they assume the existence of an
X̃i process which is close to the observed process. One key advantage of our proposal is it is free
of any such assumption. Our assumption of only the first moment is also very mild for theoretical
exploration in Section 4. Moreover, except for a very general linear model discussed in (Karmakar
et al., 2020+), to the best of our knowledge, this is the very first analysis of the time-varying
parameter for count time-series modeled by Poisson regression. Thus we choose to focus on the
methodological development rather than proving the optimality of these conditions. When p = 0,
our proposed model reduces to routinely used nonparametric Poisson regression model as in Shen
and Ghosal (2015).
To proceed with Bayesian computation, we put priors on the unknown functions µ(·) and ai (·)’s
such that they are supported in P1 . The prior distributions on these functions are induced through
basis expansions in B-splines. Suitable constraints on the coefficients are imposed to ensure the
shape constraints as in P1 . Detailed description of the priors are given below,

τk = exp(δk )
δl ∼N (0, c1 ), for 0 ≤ l ≤ p,
βj ∼N (0, c2 ) for 1 ≤ j ≤ K1

if δ0 = −∞, which has probability zero. On the other hand, we also have µ(·) ≥ 0 as we have
αj ≥ 0. Thus, the induced priors, described in (2.3)− (2.6) are well supported in P1 .

2.2

Time-varying generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity model for counts

In the previous model, both conditional mean and conditional variance depend on the past observations. However, Ferland et al. (2006) proposed integer valued analogue of generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity model (GARCH) after observing that the variability in
number of cases of campylobacterosis infections also changes with level. Given the complexity
of lag selection of TVBARC, we also introduce the following time-varying version of the integer
valued generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity model (INGARCH) for counts.
The conditional distribution for count-valued time-series Xt given Ft−1 = {Xi : i ≤ (t − 1)} and
Gt−1 = {λi : i ≤ (t − 1)} is,
Xt |Ft−1 , Gt−1 ∼Poisson(λt ) where λt = µ(t/T ) +

We call our method time-varying Bayesian Integer valued Generalized Auto Regressive Conditional
Heteroscedastic (TVBINGARCH) model. We impose following constraints on the parameter space
similar to Ferreira et al. (2017),
P2 = {µ, ai : µ(x) > 0, 0 ≤ ai (x) ≤ 1, 0 ≤ aj (x) ≤ 1, sup

This constraint ensure a unique solution of the time-varying GARCH process as discussed in
Ferreira et al. (2017). Now, we modify the proposed prior from the previous subsection to put
prior on the functions µ(·), ai (·) and bj (·) such that they are supported in P2 . Using the B-spline
bases, we put following hierarchical prior on the unknown functions,

(2.14)

λ0 ∼Inverse-Gamma(d1 , d1 ),

(2.15)

where λ0 is the rate parameter for X0 . We primarily focus on the special case where p = 1, q = 1.
Based on the constraints on the parameter space we consider following prior for αj ’s and τi ’s,
αj = exp(βj ),
τk = exp(δk )
δl ∼N (0, c1 ), for 0 ≤ l ≤ p,
βj ∼N (0, c2 ) for 1 ≤ j ≤ K1
Similar calculations from the previous subsection also show that the above hierarchical prior
is well-supported in P2 . We only consider TVBINGARCH(1,1) which is commonly used for the
GARCH class of models. A major drawback of TVBARC is proper lag selection. To alleviate
this, we propose the TVBINGARCH framework. As in the stationary case, TVBINGARCH(1,1)
can be viewed as TVBARC with infinite order. Then the higher values in b1 (·)’s is an indication
that there might be important higher lags in TVBARC.

Posterior computation

In this section, we discuss the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling method for posterior
computation. Our proposed sampling is dependent on the gradient-based Hamiltonian Monte
Carlo (HMC) sampling algorithm (Neal et al., 2011). Hence, we show the gradient computations
of the likelihood with respect to different parameters for TVBARC(p) and TVBINGARCH(p, q)
in the following two subsections.

While fitting TVBINGARCH(p, q), we assume for any t < 0 Xt = 0, λt = 0. Thus, we need
to additionally estimate the parameter λ0 , the Poisson rate parameter for X0 . The derivative of
the likelihood concerning λ0 is calculated numerically by differentiating from the first principles.
Hence, it is sampled using the HMC algorithm too.
As the parameter spaces of θij ’s and ηkj ’s have bounded support, we map any Metropolis candidate, falling outside of the parameter space back to the nearest boundary point of the parameter
space. To obtain a good acceptance rate, we tune our HMC sampler periodically. There are two
tuning parameters in HMC namely the leapfrog step, and the step size parameter. The step size
10

parameter is tuned to maintain an acceptance rate within the range of 0.6 to 0.8. The step size
is reduced if the acceptance rate is less than 0.6 and increased if the rate is more than 0.8. This
adjustment is done automatically after every 100 iterations. However, we choose to pre-specify
the leapfrog step at 30 and obtain good results. Due to the increasing complexity of the parameter
space in TVBINGARCH, we consider updating all the parameters involved in ai (·)’s, bk (·)’s, and
λ0 together.

Large-sample properties

In this section we obtain posterior contraction rates for the two proposed models. For clarity of
presenting the assumptions under which these results are true, we will make the conditions in
(2.2) and (2.8) more specific. To study posterior contraction properties, the priors for αj and τi
are modified little bit to ensure better control over tail probabilities,
αj ∼ Gamma(g1 , g1 ),

τi ∼ U (0, 1).

(4.1)

TVBARC structure

We start by studying large sample properties of the simpler AR model in (2.1). For simplicity, we
fix order p at p = 1 for this section however the results are easily generalizable for any fixed order
p. The posterior consistency is studied in the asymptotic regime of increasing sample size T . Let
κ = (µ, a1 ) stands for the complete set of parameters. For sake of generality of the method, we
put a prior on K1 and K2 with probability mass function given by,
Π(Ki = k) = bi1 exp[−bi2 k(log k)bi3 ],

(4.2)

with bi1 , bi2 > 0 and 0 ≤ bi3 ≤ 1 for i = 1, 2. Poisson and geometric probability mass functions
appear as special cases of the above prior density for bi3 = 1 or 0 respectively. These priors
have not been considered while fitting the model as it would require computationally expensive
reversible jump MCMC strategy. We study the posterior consistency with respect to the average
Hellinger distance on the coefficient functions which is

The contraction rate will depend on the smoothness of true coefficient functions µ and a and the
parameters b13 and b23 from the prior distributions of K1 and K2 . Let κ0 = (µ0 , a10 ) be the truth
of κ.
Assumptions (A): There exists constants 0 < Mµ < MX such that,
(A.1) At time t = 0, Eκ0 (X0 ) < MX .

by recursion. Assumption (A.3) is imposed to ensure strict positivity of parameters and is standard
in time-varying literature that deals with such constrained parameters. The posterior contraction
rate at κ0 ∈ A with respect to the metric d1,T on A is a sequence T → 0 such that Pκ0 Π(κ :
d1,T (κ, κ0 ) > MT T |X (T ) ) → 0 for every MT → ∞, where A denotes the function spaces of (µ, a1 )
satisfying Assumptions (A) and the observation X (T ) = {X0 , X1 , . . . , XT }.
Theorem 1. Under assumptions (A.1)-(A.3), let the true functions µ0 (·) and a10 (·) be Hölder

where bij are specified in (4.2). For the proof, the first step is to calculate posterior contracR 1/2 1/2

construct exponentially consistent tests leveraging on the famous Neyman-Pearson Lemma as has
also been used in Ning et al. (2020) for a multivariate linear regression setup under group sparsity.
The proof is postponed to Section 8. The proof is based on the general contraction rate result
from Ghosal and Van der Vaart (2017) and some results on B-splines based finite random series.

TVBINGARCH structure

Next, we discuss the more comprehensive tvBINGARCH model (2.7). To maintain simplicity in
the proof, we again assume p = 1, q = 1. Similar to the previous subsection, we put a prior on the
number of Bspline bases, Ki with probability mass function given by,
Π(Ki = k) = bi1 exp[−bi2 k(log k)bi3 ],
with bi1 , bi2 > 0 and 0 ≤ bi3 ≤ 1 for i = 1, 2, 3. Let us assume that ψ = (µ, a1 , b1 ) be the complete
set of parameters. We study the posterior consistency with respect to the Hellinger distance on
the coefficient functions which is
d22,T

For this structure, we modify the assumptions as
Assumptions(B): There exists constants 0 < Mµ < MX such that,
(B.1) At time t = 0, Eψ0 (X0 ), λ0 < MX .
(B.2) The coefficient functions supx µ0 (x) < Mµ and supx (a10 (x) + b10 (x)) < 1 − Mµ /MX .
(B.3) inf x min(µ0 (x), a10 (x), b10 (x)) > ρ for some small ρ > 0.
Assumptions (B.1), (B.2) ensure

by recursion. Thus we have, by Assumption (B.1-B.2)
Eψ0 (Xt ) < MX ,

Eψ0 (λt ) = Eψ0 (Xt |Xt−1 , λt−1 ) = Eψ0 (Xt ) < MX .

Assumption (B.3) is imposed to ensure strict positivity of parameters and is standard in timevarying literature that deals with such constrained parameters.

Simulation studies

In this section, we study the performance of our proposed Bayesian method in capturing the
true coefficient functions. We compare both TVBARC and TVBINGARCH methods with some
other competing models. It is important to note that, this is to the best of our knowledge first
work in Poisson autoregression with a time-varying link. Thus, we compare our method with the
existing time-series models with time-constant coefficients for count data and time-varying AR
with Gaussian error. We also examine the estimation accuracy of the coefficient functions for
estimating the truth.
The hyperparameters c1 and c2 of the normal prior are all set 100, which makes the prior
weakly informative. The hyperparameters for Inverse-Gamma prior d1 = 0.1, which is also weakly
informative. We consider 6 equidistant knots for the B-splines based on comparing the AMSE
scores. We choose the knot number after which the AMSE score does not change significantly. We
collect 10000 MCMC samples and consider the last 5000 as post-burn-in samples for inferences.
In absence of any alternative method for time-varying AR(p) model of count-valued data, we
compare the estimated functions with the true functions in terms of the posterior estimates of
functions along with its 95% pointwise credible bands. The credible bands are calculated from the
MCMC samples at each point t = 1/T, 2/T, . . . , 1. We also compare different competing methods
in terms of average MSE (AMSE) score using the INGARCH method of tsglm from R package
tscount, GARMA using tscount as well, tvAR and our proposed Bayesian methods. The AMSE
P
is defined as T1 t (Xt − λ̂t )2 . We estimate this in terms of the posterior mean of AMSEs across
14

MCMC as

AM SE =

where λ̂St is the posterior estimate of λt at S-th postburn sample.

Case 1: TVBARC structure

Here, we consider two model settings p = 1; Xt ∼ Poisson(µ(t/T ) + a1 (t/T )Xt−1 ) and p = 2; Xt ∼
Poisson(µ(t/T ) + a1 (t/T )Xt−1 + a2 (t/T )Xt−2 ) for t = 1, . . . , T . Three different choices for T have
been considered, T = 100, 500 and 1000. The true functions are,

µ0 (x) =10 exp − (x − 0.5)2 /0.1 ,
a10 (x) =0.3(x − 1)2 + 0.1,
a02 (x) =0.4x2 + 0.1.
We compare the estimated functions with the truth for sample size 1000 in Figures 2 and
Figure 3 for the models p = 1 and p = 2 respectively. Tables 1 and 2 illustrate the performance
of our method with respect to other competing methods.

Case 2: TVBINGARCH structure

For the tvBINGARCH case, we only consider one simulation settings p = 1, q = 1; Xt ∼ Poisson(µ(t/T )+
a1 (t/T )Xt−1 + b1 (t/T )λt−1 ). Two different choices for T have been considered, T = 100 and 200,

with p = 1, q = 1. The performance of our method is compared to other competing methods in
Tables 3.

Figure 2 to 4 shows that our proposed Bayesian method captures the true functions quite well
for both of the two simulation experiments. We find that the estimation accuracy improves as the
sample size increases. As the sample size grows, the 95% credible bands are also getting tighter,
implying lower uncertainty in estimation. This gives empirical evidence in favor of the estimation
17

consistency which has also been verified theoretically in Section 4. The average mean square error
(AMSE) is always the lowest for our method in Tables 1, 2 and 3.

COVID-19 spread at NYC

We collect the data of new affected cases for every day from 23rd January to 14th July from an

open-source platform {https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset}.
The end date 14th July is chosen as around that time NYC started the process of re-opening. The
data on daily new cases are illustrated in Figure 5. We were particularly interested in NYC
data as this city remained an epicenter in US for about a month. With the help of government
interventions and sustained lock-down, the recovery was significant in about 3 months. Such a
time-varying nature of the data motivated us to retrospect as how the mean trend and AR trend
behave which can also shed some insight about effects of lockdown or the contagious spread.
Based on the findings on the incubation of the virus in Lauer et al. (2020a) and others, it is
understood that the symptoms often take some time after the virus affects through contagion. Our
idea is to consider different models with varying number of lags for this. We consider TVBARC(1),
TVBARC(10) and TVBINGARCH(1,1) here. The results for the TVBARC(1) are illustrated in
Figure 6. We see that during the spike in daily new cases the function a1 (·) is the highest. Figure 7
depicts the estimated mean and coefficient functions from a TVBARC(10) model. We find that
the estimated a1 (·) functions show a similar trend. On top of that, we see that a6 (·), a7 (·) and
a8 (·) have also some effect. Finally we fit our TVBINGARCH(1,1) which might be considered
TVBARC with infinite order. Figure 8 depicts the estimated functions, the mean {µ(·)}, AR(1)
{a1 (·)} and CH(1) {b1 (·)} coefficient functions. In Table 4, we compare the AMSE scores across
different models. For all the models, we consider 12 equidistant knots based on the AMSE scores
as discussed in Section 5.
Figure 7 suggests that even lag 6, 7, and 8 have some significant contribution. The effect of
this lag is suppressed in Figure 6 and is expressed in terms of b1 (·) of Figure 8. The estimated
mean functions also behave similarly for all the three cases. It shows a spike during the rise of
daily new cases. After that, it decreases which can talk about successful containment strategies
in NYC. More specifically it decreases after around 15 days since the strict implementation of
statewide lockdown on 20-th March. This is consistent with what was found in our unsubmitted
18

Figure 5: Daily new COVID-19 cases from 31st January to 14th of July recorded at NYC.
preprint (Roy and Karmakar, 2020) through an empirical early-stage analysis of the spread in
different cities and countries.
The effect of Lag 6, 7, and 8 can be attributed to the incubation period of the virus. It
can also lead to the finding that there was a weekly periodicity which is probably due to shorter
testing/administrative facilities being available during the weekend. Note that our choice of fitting
an TVBARC(10) model is more general than separately fitting a seasonal/periodic time-series
model. Another important finding is coming from the overall trend of a1 (·). It starts to decrease
when the number of cases starts going down. However later on it varies around 0.6 can be
attributed to the fact that the number of new cases did not vary much and remained around the
same level from the middle of May. The credible bands look very small around the mean function
which is probably due to the large magnitude of the estimated function.

Discussion

We propose a time-varying Bayesian autoregressive model for counts (TVBARC) and time-varying
Bayesian integer-valued generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedastic model (TVBINGARCH) with linear link function within Poisson error to study the time series of daily new
confirmed cases of COVID-19. We develop a novel hierarchical Bayesian model that satisfies
the stability condition for the respective time-varying models and propose an HMC algorithm
based MCMC sampling scheme. We also establish posterior contraction rate results of the proposed Bayesian methods.

The ‘R’ function with an example code can be found at https:

//github.com/royarkaprava/TVBARC. Relying on the proposed hierarchical Bayesian model,
one can develop a time-varying Bayesian model for positive-valued time-series data too. Our analysis of NYC data shows that there is a time-varying effect of Lag 6, 7, and 8. Some preliminary
analysis on COVID data using our model based on the data until April 24 are archived in our
unpublished pre-print Roy and Karmakar (2020). There are some more interesting findings related
to significant lags for different countries.
As future work, it will be interesting to include some country-specific information such as
demographic information, geographical area, the effect of environmental time-series, etc in the
model. These are usually important factors for the spread of any infectious disease. We can
also categorize the different types of government intervention effects to elaborate more on the
specific impacts of the same. In the future we wish to analyze the number of deaths, number of
recovered cases, number of severe/critical cases, etc. for these diseases as those will hopefully have
21

different dynamics than the one considered here and can provide useful insights about the spread
and measures required. For computational ease, we have considered the same level of smoothness
for all the coefficient functions. Fitting this model with different levels of smoothness might
be able to provide more insights. Lag selection is a difficult task for time-varying auto-regressive
models. One potential future direction would be to put sparsity inducing prior to the time-varying
coefficient functions in TVBARC for automatic lag detection. Other than building time-varying
autoregressive models for count-valued data using the hierarchical structure from this article, one
interesting future direction is to extend this model for vector-valued count data. In general, it is
difficult to model multivariate count data. There are only a limited number of methods to deal
with multivariate count data (Besag, 1974; Yang et al., 2013; Roy and Dunson, 2019). Building
on these multivariate count data models, one can extend our time-varying univariate AR(p) to a
time-varying vector-valued AR(p). On the same note, even though we imposed Poisson assumption
for increased model interpretation, in the light of the upper bounds for the KL distance, it is not
a necessary criterion and can be applied to a general multiple non-stationary count time-series.
Extending some of the continuous time-series invariance results for nonlinear non-stationary and
multiple series from Karmakar and Wu (2020) to a count series regime will be an interesting
challenge. Finally, we wish to undertake an autoregressive estimation of the basic reproduction
number with the time-varying version of compartmental models in epidemiology.

Proof of Theorems

We study the frequentist property of the posterior distribution is increasing T regime assuming that
the observations are coming from a true density f0 characterized by the parameter κ0 . We follow
the general theory of Ghosal et al. (2000) to study the posterior contraction rate for our problem.
In the Bayesian framework, the density f is itself a random measure and has distribution Π which is
the prior distribution induced by the assumed prior distribution on κ. The posterior distribution of
a neighborhood UT = {f : d(f, f0 ) < T } around f0 given the observation X (T ) = {X0 , X1 , . . . , XT }
is

General proof strategy

The posterior consistency would hold if above posterior probability almost surely goes to zero in

Fκ0 probability as T goes to zero, where Fκ0 is the true distribution of X (T ) . Recall the definition
(T )

of posterior contraction rate; for a sequence T if ΠT (d(f, f0 )|X (T ) ≥ MT T |X (T ) ) → 0 in Fκ0 probability for every sequence MT → ∞, then the sequence T is called the posterior contraction
rate. If the assertion is true for a constant MT = M , then the corresponding contraction rate
becomes slightly stronger.
Note that for two densities f0 , f characterized by κ0 and κ respectively, the Kullback-Leibler
divergences are given by

Posterior contraction in terms of average negative log-affinity

In this section, we focus on the requirements to calculate posterior contraction rate as in Section 8.1.We first show posterior consistency in terms of average negative log-affinity which is deR 1/2 1/2
Q
fined as rT2 (f1 , f2 ) = − T1 log f1 f2 between f1 and f2 . Here, we have f1 = Ti=1 Pκ1 (Xi |Xi−1 ).
Then we show that, having rT2 (f1 , f0 ) . 2n implies that our distance metric d22,T (f1 , f0 ) . 2n .
Proceeding with the rest of the proof of Theorem 1, we use the results of B-Splines, kµ−µ0 k∞ ≤
kα − α0 k∞ , where α = {αj } and ka1 − a10 k∞ ≤ kγ − γ0 k∞ , where γj = θ1j M1 , such that γj < 1.
The Hölder smooth functions with regularity ι can be approximately uniformly up to order K −ι
−ι1
−ι2
with K many B-splines. Thus we have T & max{K1T
, K2T
}.

We need to lower bound the prior probability as required by (i). We have the result (8.6) and
1T +K2T
the prior probabilities Π(kα − α0 k∞ . T , kγ − γ0 k∞ . T ) & K
based on the discussion of
T

A2 from Shen and Ghosal (2015). The rate of contraction cannot be better than the parametric
rate T −1/2 , and so log(1/T ) . log T . Thus (i) requires that in terms of pre-rate ¯T , we need
(K1T + K2T ) log T . T ¯2T .

25

In our problem, we consider following sieve as required by (ii)
WT = {K1 , K2 , α, γ : K1 ≤ K1T , K2 ≤ K2T , kαk∞ ≤ AT , min(α, γ) > ρT , γ ≤ 1 − AT /BT ,
λ0 ≤ BT , AT < BT },

(8.7)

where AT , BT are at least polynomial in T and λ0 is the mean of X0 and KT = max{K1T , K2T }.
We take ρT  T −a with a < 1, AT  T a1 , BT  T a2 with a2 > a1 for technical need. Note
that, for κ ∈ WT , we have Eκ (Xt ) < BT . We need to choose these bounds carefully so that
we have Π(WTc ) ≤ exp(−(1 + C1 )T 2T ), which depend on tail properties of the prior. We have,
Π(WTc ) = Π[K1 > K1T , K2 > K2T , αK1T ∈ {x : inf x > ρT , sup x < AT , γK2T ∈
/ {x : inf x >
ρT , sup x < 1 −

Hence we have, Π(WTc ) ≤ Π(K1 > K1T ) + Π(K2 > K2T ) + Π{αK1T ∈

from the proof of Roy et al. (2018). The gamma prior of λ0 has exponential tail similar to α1 and
thus can be ignored as K1T grows with T . Since BT > AT , the tail of λ0 can be upper bounded
by tail of α1
Hence, Π(WTc ) . F1 (K1T ) + F2 (K2T ) + (K1T + K2T ) exp{−RT a5 }. The two functions F1 and F2
in the last expression stand for the tail probabilities of the prior of K1 and K2 . We can calculate
their asymptotic order as, F1 (x) = Π(K1 > x)  exp{−x(log x)b13 } and F2 (x) = Π(K2 > x) 
exp{−x(log x)b23 }. We need Π(WTc ) . exp{−(1 + CT )T 2T }. Hence, we calculate pre-rate from the

To construct the test as required in (iii), we first construct the test for point alternative

It is natural to have a neighborhood around κ1 such the Type II error remains exponentially
small for all the alternatives in that neighborhood under the test function φ1T . By Cauchy-Schwarz

a1 (t/T )Xt−1 > ρT or > ρT Xt−1 , |µ(t/T ) − µ1 (t/T )| < r1 and |a1 (t/T ) − a11 (t/T )| < r2 . Taking

it holds for all t. We use the result eq − 1 ≤ 2q for q < 1.
With λ1 (X0 ) = µ(1) + a1 (1)X0 , we have

Then choose sieve parameters such that Qa1 /BT = a1 (1)(eq − 1) ≤ 2a1 (1)q is very small which
is ensured as q is very small. Then µ(1)Q/BT + λ0 (eQa1 (1)/BT − 1) ≈ Qµ(1)/BT + λ0 ( QaB1T(1) ) ≤
Q{µ(1)/BT + a1 (1)} < Q as within the sieve µ(1)/BT + a1 (1) < AT /BT + (1 − AT /BT ) = 1.
Hence, E(eqX1 ) < eQ . Recursively, for all t, we can show E(eqXt ) < eQ .
Our primary goal of showing Eκ1 (f /f1 )2 < ∞ can be fulfilled if Q is a constant, independent
of T . To ensure Q is independent of T we need BT (eq − 1) is constant. It suffices to make qBT
constant as qBT < BT (eq − 1) < 2qBT . Thus, for r2 ≤

Proof of Theorem 2

The proof will follow similar path as in the previous section. Thus we just specifically touch upon
the parts that require different treatment. We can rewrite history of the INGARCH process as
{Ft−1 , Gt−1 } = {Ft−1 , λ0 }. For the INGARCH case, the likelihood based on the parameter space
Q
κ is different from above and is given by, Pψ0 (X0 , λ0 ) Tt=1 Pψ (Xt |Ft−1 , λ0 ). Since all the steps are
similar for the proof of Theorem 2, we only provide a outline. First to bound KL by the sup norm
distances among functions, we need to tackle |b11 (t/T )λ1t − b01 (t/T )λ0t |. For this term we have
|b11 (t/T )λ1t − b01 (t/T )λ0t | ≤ λ0t kb11 − b01 k∞ + max b11 (t)|λ1t − λ0t |.

max γ1 + max γ2 ≤ 1 − AT /BT , λ0 ≤ BT },

(8.16)

as in the previous problem. Within the sieve, we have EEt−1 (max(Xt , λt )) < BT . Here the extra
terms such as K3 stands for number of basis in b1 (t) and the vectors γ1 and γ2 correspond to
the B-spline coefficients of the functions a1 (t) and b1 (t) respectively. Also note that we now
31

have a lower bound for AT for technical need. We take ρT ≈ T −a with a < 1, AT = BT (1 −
exp(log T /T )ρT ), BT ≈ T a2 for sufficiently large T such that exp(log T /T )ρT < 1. Within the
sieve again we use a variant of above inequality. Note that within the sieve E(Xt ) ≤ BT and
E(λt ) ≤ BT .
We have that,
|λ1t − λt | ≤ kµ1 − µk∞ + Xt−1 ka11 − a1 k∞ + (1 −

(8.19)

by first Jensen’s inequality as λt = Eψ (Xt |Ft−1 , λ0 ) and positive correlation between exp{a1 (t)Xt−1 q}
and exp{b1 (t)Xt−1 q} under the expectation Et−1 . For two positively correlated random variables
Y and Z under the sample space, we have E(Y Z) > E(Y )E(Z). Now using this recurrence result
