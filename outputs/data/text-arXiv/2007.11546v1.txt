Abstract:
We studied the volatility and cross-sectional return dispersion effect of S&P Health Care Sector under the
covid-19 epidemic. We innovatively used the Google index to proxy the impact of the epidemic and modeled
the volatility. We also studied the influencing factors of the log-return of S&P Energy Sector and S&P Health
Care Sector. We found that volatility is significantly affected by both the epidemic and cross-sectional return
dispersion, and the coefficients in front of them are all positive, which means that the herding behaviour did
not exist and as the cross-sectional return dispersion increases and the epidemic becomes more severe, the
volatility of stock returns is also increasing. We also found that the epidemic has a significant negative impact
on the return of the energy sector, and finally we provided our suggestions to investors.

1. Introduction
Covid-19 epidemic swept the world in 2020, first in China, then in Japan, South Korea, Iran, Italy, Spain, the
United Kingdom and the United States. The epidemic caused a sharp economic downturn. According to the
information of the United States Department of Commerce, the real GDP of the United States fell by 4.8% in
the first quarter.
Herding and return dispersion have been studied by many researchers. Many literatures showed that
herding exists widely in stock market, especially in developing countries (Chiang, T. C., and Zheng, D.,2010).
In this paper, we want to explore whether there is herding effect in American stock market, whether the
epidemic has an impact on the return of American stock market, and what factors affect the stock volatility
in this period. Different from the similar research, we not only use the traditional indicators such as the
number of infected persons to represent the abstract variable of epidemic situation, but also use Google
index to represent it, which enables us to better reflect the real impact of the epidemic situation when the
data of COVID-19 in the United States is distorted in the early stage of the epidemic. In terms of sector
selection, we selected S&P 500 health care sector and energy sector for comparison, and calculated their
respective CSAD and CSSD indexes. Since the outbreak time in the United States is very close to now, and
the epidemic is still developing, we chose two time periods, namely short time horizon from March 2 to May
29 (63 time observations), and long time horizon from February 20, 2020 to June 12, 2020 (80 time
observations). The basis for this choice will be explained later. Finally, we will make investment suggestions
to investors on our results.

2. Literature Review
2.1 Return Dispersion and Herding Behavior
Chang, E. C., Cheng, J. W., and Khorana, A. (2000) have made a remarkable contribution to the study of herd
behaviour and herd behaviour. They have found that herd behaviour is more obvious in some emerging
markets than in mature markets, especially during periods of rising market prices. Not only normal investors,
Choi, N., and Sias, R. W. (2009) found that herding behaviour also existed in institutional investors. Fei, T.,
Liu, X., and Wen, C. (2019) regarded the cross-sectional stock return dispersion as a kind of herd behaviour
indicator like previous researchers did, the cross-sectional return dispersion index in our later paper refers
4

to their research .
Maio, P. (2016) studied the relation between stock return dispersion and the future stock return, he found
that compared with other indicators, return dispersion have a stronger prediction, especially for the largescale stocks and growth stocks. Prior to this, Stivers, C. T. (2003) conducted similar studies, but he used data
on monthly returns dispersion. He also studied the relationship between returns dispersion and future
volatility, and found that these relationships are very significant. Chortareas, G., Jiang, Y., and Nankervis, J.
C. (2011) focus on the euro volatility, and they found that data with high-frequency and long-time horizon
could improve volatility forecasting performance significantly.
In terms of the method for studying volatility, the conventional models are the ARCH model (Engle, R.
F. ,1982) and GARCH model (Bollerslev, T. ,1986), but many researchers have used the improved model of
the GARCH model. For example, Hwang*, S., and Satchell, S. E. (2005) have used the GARCHX model. Many
researchers also used the GJR-Garch model proposed by Glosten et al. (1993) or the TGARCH model
proposed by Zakoian (1994) or the EGARCH proposed by Nelson and Cao (1991). Fei, T., Liu, X., and Wen, C.
(2019) chose the GARCH, GJR-GARCH, and HAR model, one of their findings is that the cross-sectional stock
return dispersion did have significant influence on the forecast volatility. Onali, E. (2020) did a very updated
research on the relation between the stock volatility and COVID-19 epidemic, he added the COVID-19 factor
both into mean equation and volatility equation of the Garch(1,1) model, interestingly, he first regarded the
increasing infections in Iran as a good index for American stock market, while in the end, he did not find the
significance. Even, the infections and deaths cases from most of the countries (include America itself) he
studied showed no influence on the US stocks returns, but showed significant influence on volatility.

2.2 COVID-19
In December 2019, an unexplained pneumonia virus outbreak occurred in Wuhan.
The epidemic was first discovered in the Wuhan South China Seafood Wholesale Market. With the
development of the epidemic, infected people also appeared in other provinces in China and in other

5

countries (Li et al. 2020). On February 11, 2020, WHO named the virus COVID-19. One month later, on March
12, 2020, the National Health Commission of China announced that the peak period of the covid-19 epidemic
had passed, but other countries represented by US, Iran, Italy, and South Korea had an outbreak. At about
the same time, WHO announced covid-19 Epidemic Global Pandemic.
Data from Johns Hopkins University, as of April 28, more than 1 million people in the United States were
infected with COVID-19, and more than 2 million as of June 8.

2.3 Internet Search and Google Index
The data left behind by web searches for research and prediction has a long history. H. A. Johnson et al.
(2004) collected the visit data of health-related websites and found that the number of visitors of flu-related
articles and other flu-related data had a strong correlation with the influenza number data provided by the
CDC. Later, j. Ginsberg et al. (2009) studied the relationship between Google search data and the incidence
of influenza diseases, and found that through the modeling of the two, the outbreak of influenza could be
predicted 1-2 weeks in advance of the traditional method. N. Askitas et al. (2009) took the unemployment
rate of Germany as the research object. He conducted statistical analysis on the keywords related to
unemployment rate in Google search and found that these keywords had a strong correlation with the actual
unemployment rate. N. P. Lincoln (2011) studied the sales volume of apple's electronic products and
empirically obtained the significant correlation between the sales volume of apple's electronic products and
the Internet search data of Google by using the Internet search data provided by Google search.
We have reasons to believe that we can use Google index data to estimate the extent of the covid-19
epidemic.

3. Data
Stocks data we chose the constituent stocks in the S&P 500 Health Care Sector and S&P 500 Energy Sector
from Yahoo Finance, time horizon from Feb 20, 2020 to June 12 th, 2020 (80 time-observations). Also, we
chose the time horizon from Mar 2nd to May 29th(63 time-observations), during which, Covid-19 in America
is very severe, and after that, there was a large black march in the United States, which had a certain impact
on our variables such as VIX and stock returns. It would be more scientific to select a narrower period.
In this paper, we focus on the three important factors.
First is COVID-19. The herding behavior we study is in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic, thus, we need
6

to choose a proxy to represent the COVID-19. One is easy to understand, the infections in the US, we take
the log of it (ln(1+x)), namely, ‘Inlg’. However, the lack of nucleic acid testing reagent and people's lack of
awareness in the early stage of the epidemic in the United States caused distortion of the data, we should
find another proxy to represent it, finally, we choose Google Index with keywords ‘COVID-19’. Why we
choose it? The impact of the COVID-19 epidemic is twofold. On the one hand, it is the practical impact, such
as the direct economic impact caused by the inability of infected people to work and the inability of factories
or companies to function normally. On the other hand, the impact of the epidemic on people's psychology.
Once people panic about the COVID-19 epidemic, they will reduce their consumption and sell assets such as
stocks, causing indirect economic losses. The increase in the number of covid-19 infections and people's fear
of the epidemic are both contributing to the rise of the Google index. Therefore, we believe that the Google
index can better reflect the true impact of the epidemic with the distortion of the epidemic data. We take
the log of it (ln(1+x)) as ‘Golg’. Also, we take log of (ln(1+x)) VIX Index, as another kind of panic indicator. In
simple terms, see the table below.

The second important factor is herding behavior, one of our targets. We followed Christie and Huang (1995)
and use CSAD and CSSD to represent it.

CSSD𝑡 = √∑(𝑟𝑖,𝑡 − 𝑟𝑚,𝑡 )2 /(𝐾 − 1)

Where 𝑟𝑚 is the mean log-return.
The log-return, CSAD and CSSD plot see Figure 1 and 2.

The third important factor is the estimation of volatility. We use the Garch(1,1)-X model, EGarch(1,1)-X
model and the GJR-arch(1)-X model. In next part, we will introduce it. For convenience, Table 2 showed the
introduction of parameters.

4. Methodology
4.1 ADF Test, Normal Distribution Test and Arch-LM Test
Before the establish of the model, we need to do the ADF Test and normal distribution test first, the Table 3
and 3 showed the test results. In Table 3, we see that except ‘Hccsad’ and ‘Hccssd’ , all the variables showed
the P-value less than 0.01, since the dataset is small, we still believed that the ‘Hccsad’ and ‘Hccssd’ (P-value
8

less than 0.1) do not exist unit root, they are stationary. Data with longer time horizon are more significant.
Table 4 showed the ‘sktest’ results, we regarded the distribution of the ‘hclg’ residual sequence as normal
distribution while ‘elg’ as ‘t-distribution’(later arch-LM test rejected the arch effect, we ended up abandoning
it).

Another test is also needed, arch-LM test. We conduct it to verify if exist ‘arch’ effect. The p-value of the
‘hclg’ with short time horizon is 0.0039, long horizon is 0.0004. There exists ‘arch’ effect. For ‘elg’, the pvalue are 0.8580 and 0.7475 respectively, ‘elg’ did not exist ‘arch’ effect.

4.2 Model
Garch (1,1)-X Model:
9

𝑦𝑡 = 𝛽0 + 𝜖𝑡

(3)

2
2
𝜎𝑡2 = 𝛼0 + 𝛼1 𝜖𝑡−1
+ 𝛽1 𝜎𝑡−1
+ 𝛾1 𝑥𝑡

(4)

Where we use Inlg, Golg, VIXlg, HCcsad, HCcssd, LaggedHCcsad and LaggedHCcssd as 𝑥𝑡 respectively.
Besides, for comparation, we would fit the data by two time-horizons. Time one from Mar 2nd to May 29th
and time two from Feb 20th to June 12th.
EGarch (1,1)-X Model:
Mean equation is the same with the GARCH(1,1)-X model. And volatility term has been written as:
2 )
ln(𝜎𝑡2 ) = 𝜔 + 𝛼1 (𝜙𝜂𝑡−1 + 𝛾(|𝜂𝑡−1 | − 𝐸|𝜂𝑡−1 |)) + 𝛽1 ln(𝜎𝑡−1
+ 𝜆1 𝑥𝑡

(5)

Where 𝜂𝑡 is i.i.d. standardized random variables with N(0,1). Still, we would fit the data by two time-horizons.
GJR-Garch (1,1)-X Model:
2
2
2
𝜎𝑡2 = 𝛼0 + 𝛼1 𝑢𝑡−1
+ 𝛽1 𝜎𝑡−1
+ 𝛾𝑢𝑡−1
𝐼𝑡−1 + 𝜆1 𝑥𝑡

(6)

Where 𝐼𝑡−1 = 1 if 𝑢𝑡−1 < 0 and = 0 if 𝑢𝑡−1 ≥ 0
In addition, we also want to study if the COVID-19 and lagged return dispersion affect the log return of Health
Care Sector and Energy Sector, since we suspect that the epidemic will have a negative impact on energy
stocks and a positive impact on health care stocks. Therefore, we establish the multiple linear regression
model.
𝑦𝑡 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1 𝑥1,𝑡 + 𝛽2 𝑥2,𝑡 + 𝛽3 𝑥3,𝑡 + 𝜖𝑡

(7)

Where 𝑥1,𝑡 is the S&P 500 Index, 𝑥2,𝑡 is the COVID-19 proxy, 𝑥3,𝑡 is the return dispersion index (we use CSAD
here due to the results are very closed).

5. Finding and Discussion
Table 5 and 6 showed the Garch-X(1,1) results, and table 7 and 8 showed EGarch-X(1,1) results. Both the
models fit narrower time horizon data well, we think that is because the narrow time horizon is the most
severe time period in the United States during COVID-19, after which, the stock market has digested many
factors of the epidemic and there were protests against racism in the United States, and these protests may
affect our proxies and stock returns. The time before march, COVID-19 infections are very low in the United
10

States, which also affect the model performance, that is why we could not run the results when using long
time horizon.

In table 5, the coefficients of the arch term and ‘Garch’ term are very significant in all the models from model
1 to model 7, we found that the coefficients of ‘Inlg’, ‘Golg’, ‘Vixlg’ are significantly positive, which implies
that the COVID-19 affects the stock market volatility significantly, when COVID-19 more severe, investors
more panic, and the stock volatility get higher. For herding behavior index, CSAD and CSSD, whether it is the
current CSAD(CSSD) or the CSAD(CSSD) lagging one period, the coefficients in front of them are significantly
positive, which means that there is no herding effect. But as far as these two indicators are concerned, the
return dispersion has led to an increase in volatility. We believe that the reason could be that US dollar assets
are safe-haven assets, and this COVID-19 epidemic is a global epidemic. When the global asset risk increases,
Investors will increase the allocation of U.S. dollar assets, resulting in the negative factors caused by the
epidemic and the positive factors brought about by risk aversion repeatedly affecting the market, resulting
in return dispersion and rising volatility.
In table 7, the coefficients of ‘egarch_a_L1’ and ‘egarch_L1’ are significant in model 1, 6 and 7, which indicate
there exist the leverage effect, however, as for the whole, we cannot say that the leverage effect is significant.
Table 8 showed part of the results. Some models Stata does not run the results, also, the ‘earch’ term of the
model with current CSAD(CSSD) and vixlg are not significant. Meanwhile, these three models are not the
focus of our discussion, so we will not discuss them here.

Remark: EGarch-X(1,1) with Het Inlg, Golg, LaggedHCcsad, LaggedHCcssd: Stata cannot run the results.

Table 9 showed the GJR-Garch-X(1,1) results, compared with Egarch(1,1)-X, GJR model showed that the
leverage effect (‘tgarch_a_L1’ term) is not significant, partly confirmed the results of the Egarch(1,1)-X model.
We think the reason is that the COVID-19 epidemic is both good and bad effect for the stocks in health care.
On the one hand, the epidemic makes the production of enterprises slow down and the economy under
pressure. On the other hand, the market demand for the medical industry increases at this time, and finally
the leverage effect is not significant. Nevertheless, of all the seven GJR-Garch-X(1,1) models, we are pleased
that the Xt term of volatility estimation are very significant, findings like Garch-X(1,1) model, Covid-19 has a
positive impact on the volatility of the U.S. stock market. Herding effect is not significant during this period,
but the dispersion of returns makes the volatility of stock returns increase.

Table 10 showed the results of multiple linear regression. From it, we found that except the market factor
‘splg’, both COVID-19 factor and return dispersion factor did not show the significant result on stocks in
14

Health Care sector. But for Energy Sector, COVID-19 factor ‘inlg’ in model 2 of 63 time-observations
regression and ‘golg’ in model 1 of 80 time-observations showed the negative significant relation with the
‘elg’. Which partly confirm our conjectures. However, cross-sectional return dispersion(lagged) showed no
relation with stock return.

6. Conclusion and Suggestions
6.1 Conclusions
We have the three main conclusion.
The first conclusion is that herding does not exist (in terms of S&P health care sector), however, the
coefficients in front of CSAD(lagged) and CSSD(lagged) are significantly positive, which showed that crosssectional return dispersion increased the volatility of stock returns.
The second conclusion is that the COVID-19 epidemic had a significant positive impact on the stocks return
volatility of health care sector. The higher the number of infections and Google search volume, the higher
the stocks return volatility.
The third conclusion is that the return-dispersion with lags one period has no significant impact on stock
returns during the epidemic. The impact of the epidemic on different sectors is different, it has no significant
impact on the health care sector, but has a significant negative impact on the energy sector.

6.2 Suggestions
We have three suggestions for investors. The first one is that investors can short the energy sector during
the pandemic, and the specific operation basis can be the freely available Google index (with keywords
COVID-19).
The second suggestion is that for risk-averse investors, investment in the stock market should be reduced
during the COVID-19 outbreak, because the volatility will increase with the development of the epidemic.
The third suggestion is, for risk averse investors, if the return dispersion of the previous day is high, they can
sell stocks or hedge stocks today to reduce the negative effects of high volatility. And for high-frequency
traders, they can enter the market today to seek trading opportunities with high volatility.
