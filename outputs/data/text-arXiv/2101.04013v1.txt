ABSTRACT
Objective
Machine Learning (ML) models typically require large-scale, balanced training data to be robust,
generalizable, and effective in the context of healthcare. This has been a major issue for developing
ML models for the coronavirus-disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic where data are highly
imbalanced. Conventional approaches in ML use cross-entropy loss (CEL) which often suffers
from poor margin classification. For the first time, we show that contrastive loss (CL) improves
the performance of CEL especially in imbalanced electronic health records (EHR) data for
COVID-19 analyses.
Materials and Methods
We use EHR data to predict mortality, intubation, and intensive care unit (ICU) transfer in
hospitalized COVID-19 patients over multiple time windows. We train two sequential
architectures (RNN and RETAIN) comparing CEL and CL. Models are tested on the full data set
and a restricted data set to simulate higher class imbalance. We further compare clustering ability
and feature importance detection between CEL and CL.
Results
CL models consistently outperform CEL models with the restricted data set on these tasks with
differences ranging from 0.04 to 0.15 for AUPRC and 0.05 to 0.1 for AUROC. For the restricted
sample, only the CL model maintains proper clustering and is able to identify important features,
such as pulse oximetry.
Discussion and Conclusion
CL outperforms CEL in instances of severe class imbalance, on three EHR outcomes with respect
to three performance metrics: predictive power, clustering, and feature importance. We believe
that the developed CL framework can be expanded and used for EHR ML work in general.

INTRODUCTION
Background and Significance
As of November 2020, coronavirus-disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in over 1.4 million
reported deaths with over 250,000 deaths occurring in the United States and over 24,000 deaths in
New York City (NYC) [1]. Hospital resources such as medication supply and hospital beds quickly
became constrained[2 3]. Due to the novelty of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a dearth of
relevant data available for research purposes, so electronic health records (EHR) became a
valuable tool to study and characterize COVID-19 patients. EHR have already been used in
biomedical research for disease and patient clustering, patient trajectory modeling, disease
prediction, and clinical decision support, among others[4]. Recent studies discovered important
findings to better understand COVID-19 through EHR-based analyses[5-11].
Machine learning (ML) is useful to examine resource allocation and risk stratification of patients,
and ML models were successfully used to identify high-risk COVID-19 patients[12-21].
For temporal data modeling and prediction of patient outcomes in particular, deep representation
learning (DL)[22] holds promise over traditional ML techniques that require manual engineering
of informative patient features[23-25]. Heterogeneous graph networks are a powerful DL based
graph representation technique that have successfully been utilized in EHR-related studies[26 27].
These models have a graphical structure that captures the underlying relationships between
disparate medical concepts such as diagnoses and lab tests[28]. Further, these graph convolutional
models can be endowed with an attention mechanism[29] to automatically identify how important
local neighbors in the graph are to a given medical concept[30]. Attention models such as RETAIN
provide a detailed interpretation of results and maintain high prediction accuracy by using reversetime attention mechanisms to consolidate past visits[31].
There are, however, substantial concerns about the limited generalizability of these models in
COVID-19 (and in general) as they often underperform in external validation[32 33]. Poor
generalization of the models is normally due to underspecification[34]. The underlying aspects of
EHR data may also limit model effectiveness[35]. Healthcare data sets often have inadequate
sample sizes in terms of both small hospitals and rare disease populations and exhibit high class
imbalance for key outcomes of interest, such as in rare events, as in the case with COVID-19.
Several strategies have been utilized to mitigate these data and modeling challenges including upand down- sampling, pre-training, transfer learning, and federated learning, but each have their
limitations for use in EHR research[36]. Other than these methods, the role of loss function has
yet to be thoroughly investigated in the context of COVID-19 EHR work, which is the focus of
this work. DL models often use cross-entropy loss (CEL) function, but CEL has been shown to
potentially have poor classification margins, making the model less generalizable [37]. Recently,
supervised contrastive loss (CL) has been proposed to improve the classification performance of
CEL [37]. This original CL algorithm used sets of one anchor, many positives, and many negatives
to maximize the similarities within the same class.
Though CL has already been applied to learn visual representations of medical images from paired
images and text[38 39], it has not yet been used for EHR data and COVID-19 in particular. Here,

3

we modify a CL-based architecture from its original formulation for EHR tasks. In the original
work, CL was used for representation learning and CEL was used for the downstream
classification. While we still utilize CL for patient representation learning, we explicitly
incorporate classification objective into our CL loss function. This additional term behaves similar
to CEL and maximizes the similarities between patient representation (obtained from sequential
models) and outcome representation (obtained from heterogeneous relational models)[40].
In this study, we compare different sequential models (RETAIN and RNN) models utilizing CEL
and our developed CL in predicting critical outcomes of COVID-19 mortality, ICU transfers, and
intubation for patients admitted to a large and diverse patient population from five hospitals within
the Mount Sinai Health System in New York. Models are tested on a full data set and a restricted
data set with severe class imbalance to better elucidate the impacts of these loss functions on model
performance. Results are evaluated within the framework of three dimensions: predictive power,
patient clustering, and feature importance.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Clinical Data and Cohort
We obtained Electrical Health Records (EHR) of COVID-19 patients from five hospitals within
the Mount Sinai Healthcare System (MSHS). The collected EHR data contain the following
information: COVID-19 status, demographics (age, gender, and race), 55 relevant laboratory test
results (listed in Supplementary Table 1), vital signs, specifically heart rate, respiration rate, pulse
oximetry, blood pressure (diastolic and systolic), temperature, height, and weight, and 12
comorbidities (atrial fibrillation, asthma, coronary artery disease, cancer, chronic kidney disease,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, heart failure, hypertension, stroke,
alcoholism, and liver disease). In addition, we collected information on clinically-relevant
outcomes of COVID-19: mortality, discharge, ICU transfer, and intubation. Lab tests and vital
signs were measured at multiple time points along the hospital course. In our models,
demographics features are used as static features.
Data Pre-processing
We pre-process the vital signs, lab test, and static features by considering the values between 0.5
and 99.5 percentile to remove any inaccurate measurement. For any numerical data, we normalize
the data by calculating the standard score (z-score). For categorical data, we use one-hot encoding
representation. Numerical data with missing values are included with zeros.
The initial feature input for vital signs at every time step is the vector 𝑋! ∈ 𝑅" representing the
eight features (Figure 1A). Blood pressure is represented as two features: systolic and diastolic.
Similar to vital signs, the initial feature input for lab tests is the vector 𝑋# ∈ 𝑅$$ representing the
55 features at each time step. If there is more than one vital sign or lab test for each patient, we
average the values of the corresponding time step. We concatenate the vital sign vector and lab
test vector to form the vector 𝑋% ∈ 𝑅&' as the input at every time step -- the subscripts 𝑣 and 𝑙 are
dropped for simplicity.
Static features consist of demographics (age, gender, and race) and disease comorbidity
information, which are detailed in Supplementary Table 1. For Age, we record the normalized
numerical value. We represent the Gender feature as a 2 dimensional (male and female) one-hot
vector. We use a 5 dimensional one-hot vector to represent the different groups for Race (African
American, White, Asian, Other and Unknown). We represent disease comorbidity as a 12
dimensional one-hot vector. We concatenate all the demographic and disease comorbidity features
into the vector 𝑋( ∈ 𝑅)* .
Time Sequence Modeling
To model EHR data as a time sequence, we use a previously developed interpretable predictive
model named RETAIN[31]. This model is designed specifically to add feature explainability in
terms of feature importance score on time sequence data.

5

For the RETAIN model, we present each patient for 𝑛 time steps as in Choi et al.[31]:

𝑣% = 𝑊+ 𝑋% is linear projection of the 𝑚 dimensional input feature, 𝑋% ∈ 𝑅 using projection
matrix 𝑊+ ∈ 𝑅# ×1 .
As another baseline architecture, we utilize a RNN model's 𝐶+ with the original input feature
vector 𝑋% :
𝐶+ = 𝑅𝑁𝑁(𝑋% ) .

(2)

Heterogeneous Relation Modelling
Instead of treating the outcomes as labels, we model them as a directed heterogeneous bipartite
graph as illustrated in Figure 1B. We create a triple relationship between patient, outcome, and
event, where the outcome is the relation (or edge) between patient node 𝑝 and event node 𝑒. Patient
nodes with the same outcome relations are connected to the same event node. Since we are
predicting binary outcomes, we have two event nodes representing positive and negative labels.
Modeling the data as a bipartite graph provides both label information as well as event and clinical
characteristic similarities.
Since the patient and event are two different node types, we use the heterogeneous relational model
TransE[40] to project patient and event node types and their outcome relationships into a shared
latent space. The TransE model aims to relate different type of nodes by their relationship type and
represents the relationship type (outcome) as a translation vector between the two node types. This
relation is expressed as:
𝐶82 = 𝛿(𝑊2 𝑋2 + 𝑏2 )
𝐶2 = 𝐶82 − 𝑅3 ,

(3)

where 𝑋2 is the binary outcome representation, 𝑊2 ∈ 𝑅# ×) are learnable projection parameters,
and 𝑏2 ∈ 𝑅# are bias parameters, 𝛿 is a non-linear activation function. We use a two dimensional
vector 𝑋2 ∈ (0,1)) to represent positive or negative outcomes. 𝐶82 is the latent representation of
outcomes, 𝐶2 is translated representation from 𝐶82 in the projection space by the learnable
translation relational vector 𝑅3 , which is the relation vectors representing outcome relation that
connects patients to positive event and negative event nodes, respectively.
After the projection, we apply similarity comparisons between these two representations (𝐶+ and
𝐶2 ) in the shared latent space.

6

Loss Function Delineation
After the assembly of the bipartite relational graph, we aim to predict the binary outcome of a
patient by maximizing the similarity between the binary outcome latent representation and patient
representation. The bipartite relational graph also considers the similarities within patient latent
representations that connect to the same outcome. Therefore, the objective function is expressed
as:
ℒ = max 𝑃 E𝑁4 (𝑢)|𝐶+ (𝑢)H ,

(4)

where 𝑢 is the patient node of interest in training sample, 𝐶+ (𝑢) is the latent representation of
patient node 𝑢. 𝑁4 (𝑢) is the patient node's neighboring nodes which consist of binary outcome
node representation 𝐶2 and similar patient nodes representations 𝐶+ . In Eq. (4), we optimize the
proximity between the representations of center patient node and its neighboring nodes.
The similarity between these latent representations is represented as an inner-product, and we
directly apply noise contrastive estimation (NCE) loss to capture the condition probability in Eq.
(4)[41].

where 𝐶2 is the projected latent representation of the binary outcome node that connects to a given

that connects to the same outcome node as the patient node 𝑢. 𝐶+∗ (𝑗) are the context patient node
representations that connects to the opposite outcome node as the patient node.
The first two terms in Eq. (6) capture the label information between outcome with the patient node,
so they function as cross-entropy loss. The last two terms provide additional information of similar
patients that connect to the same outcome, and dissimilar patient information that connect to the
other outcome.

information and similar patient information, and our final objective function is as follows:

(7)

In this work, we set 𝑎 = 0.8, 𝑏 = 0.2 to weigh more towards label information.
After minimizing the CL from Eq. (7), we obtain learned latent representation for events 𝐶2 , which
are used to predict the probability of the events as follows:
𝑃 E𝑌2 c𝐶+ (𝑢)H = 𝜎 E𝐶2 (𝑢) . 𝐶+ (𝑢)H ,

(8)

where 𝑌2 represents the logit prediction for positive outcomes (mortality, intubation, and ICU
transfer).
Feature Importance Scoring
The linear projection matrix 𝑊+ from the RETAIN model allows to interpret variable importance
at each time step. Our goal is to predict the probability of the outcome given a center patient
representation. We can write this probability the same as Eq. (8).

8

We can combine Eq. (1), Eq. (3) and Eq. (8) to derive the similarity score as follows:

Oa% 𝛽% ⊙

𝜔O𝑌2 , 𝑋%,M S =
K
(𝑋2 𝑊2K + 𝑏2K − 𝑅3K )𝑊+ S𝑋%,M .

(9)

This is the similarity score between the positive outcome latent representation and patient latent
representation for a RETAIN model with CL loss. The larger values of 𝜔 indicates that the feature
𝑘 has a large contribution towards the prediction result.
For interpretability of a RETAIN model with CEL, we directly compute the importance score in a
similar manner as in Choi et al.[31]:
𝜔O𝑦1 , 𝑥%,M S = a% 𝑊4 O𝛽% ⊙ 𝑊+ S 𝑋%,M ,

(10)

where 𝑦1 is the label for 𝑚-th sample.
Baselines
In this work, we are evaluating the performance of CL using two time sequence models
(RETAIN+CL and RNN+CL). As baseline models, we use the CEL with the same time sequence
models (RETAIN+CE and RNN+CE) to evaluate the potential improvements of CL.
As reference and comparison with the CL, the objective function for CEL is as follows:
ℒHNO = −

(12)

9

where 𝐶+ is the latent patient representation, 𝑊2 ∈ 𝑅) ×# and 𝐵4 ∈ 𝑅) are the binary projection and
bias parameters.
Experimental Design
We perform three prediction tasks: mortality, ICU transfer, and intubation. We train our models
on predicting events for two time frames: 24 and 48 hours before the occurrence of a binary
outcome. Longitudinal data (lab tests and vital signs) are binned within windows of 6 hours and
averaged if there is more than one measurement per window. The time binning representation is
illustrated in Figure 1C. In the training phase, for each positive outcome, we utilize the exact time
of an event to generate time frames for the experiments. For patients that did not have these
outcome events, we needed a representative frame of reference to align against. Therefore, we
compute the mean and standard deviation for the length of time that elapsed from admission for
all the affiliated outcomes independently. For patients without an event, we randomly pick a time
to use as a reference end point using a Gaussian distribution with the mean and standard deviation
obtained from the positive training data. This procedure is shown in Figure 1D.
We also perform the comparisons of outcomes for both full sample and in artificial scenarios of
more extreme imbalance (i.e., restricted sample) to determine the extent of performance
differences between the two loss functions. In terms of generating the samples for any prediction
using CEL, we find that a minimum of 5% positive labels is required to detect both negatives and
positives. Therefore, we choose any positive labels percentage to be greater than 5%. For the
experiments with full sample, we use all available data where the percentages of positive labels is
23% mortality, 17% ICU transfer, and 10% intubation. For the experiments with restricted
sample, we perform down-sampling to reduce the percentage of positive labels by randomly
removing a percentage of positive labels. The percentages of positive labels in the down sampled
data set are 7% mortality, 7% ICU transfer, and 5% intubation. In the restricted sample, the
percentage of each positive label is less than half of the original positive label percentage.
Training details
In the training stage, after picking a patient node 𝑢, we select the binary outcome node that
connects to 𝑢. Then we uniformly pick 𝑚 similar patient nodes that also connect to this outcome
node, and we use these samples as positive training pairs. For negative sampling, we first pick the
binary outcome node that does not connect to the patient node 𝑢, and we then uniformly pick 𝑞
similar patient nodes that connect to this outcome node. We utilize these samples as the negative
training pairs. In this work, we use 𝑚 = 2 and 𝑞 = 1 to prioritize the positive samples.
For validation purposes, we perform 10-fold cross validation for the patient of interest and record
the mean evaluation values across 10 folds to determine the performance of CL model against the
CE model.
All models and data sets are evaluated using the following metrics: area under the receiveroperating characteristic (AUROC), area under the precision, and recall curve (AUPRC). It is

10

important to note that AUPRC is a more reliable metric for imbalanced samples because that takes
into account NPV and PPV[42].

11

RESULTS
Model Comparison and Evaluation of Predictive Performance
We first evaluate the results between loss functions using all data (i.e., full sample) for all three
tasks, namely mortality, ICU transfer, and intubation prediction. The ROC and PR curves for these
cross validated results are shown in Fig.2,3(A-C) and metrics are tabulated in Table 1. For
mortality prediction (23% positive label percentage), we observe that the AUROC and AUPRC
scores are similar between CEL and CL. For RETAIN model, under 24h prediction time frame,
the AUROC and AUPRC scores are 0.92 ± 0.01, 0.82 ± 0.02 for CEL and 0.92 ± 0.01, 0.84 ±
0.02 for CL. These results indicate that two loss models achieve similar performance when we
have relatively more balanced label ratios. For intubation prediction, the positive label percentage
is 10.7 %, which is less than half of the mortality labels. We observe relatively larger performance
increases of 0.03 ± 0.02 for AUROC score and 0.09 ± 0.02 for AUPRC in CL compared to CEL
for the RETAIN model. For ICU transfer prediction ( 17% positive label percentage) using
RETAIN, we observe that the AUROC, AUPRC performance of CL is around 0.84 ±
0.01, 0.60 ± 0.02 which are slightly higher than CEL performance of 0.81 ± 0.01, 0.57 ± 0.02.
To further evaluate the above trends, we conducted an additional experiment to assess how CEL
and CL functions perform on the same tasks with more imbalanced outcome ratios. This scenario
may be the case in smaller hospital cohorts and for other outcomes. We perform random downsampling on positive labels (i.e., restricted sample): for mortality, intubation, and ICU transfer
prediction tasks, we randomly down-sampled the positive labels to 7%, 5%, and 7% ,
respectively. The ROC and PR curves are shown in Fig.2,3(E-F) and the performance metrics are
recorded in Table 2. The results of the experiment consistently show lower performance using
CEL compared to CL. For RETAIN model under 24h time frame, AUROC and AUPRC values
are higher for CL than CEL for all outcomes. For instance, the AUROC increases from 0.80±0.02
(CEL) to 0.88±0.02 (CL) and AUPRC increases from 0.35±0.03 (CEL) to 0.45±0.02 (CL) for
intubation prediction These finding show that under cases with extremely unbalanced label data,
models using CL perform better than using CEL.
Our results show that CEL and CL have competitive performance in the full data set but we
generally find that for all tasks in restricted data set, models with CEL have lower performance
compared to CL (Table 2). Other than the 24-hour time frame, we also perform the same exact
analysis for the 48-hour time frame, which shows consistent trends. Finally, we use the RNN as
the baseline model other than RETAIN model for all the predictions described earlier and our
conclusions hold true (see Table 2).
Identification of Important Clinical Features
We assess the ability of CEL and CL functions in our models to identify relevant features of
interest in full and restricted data sets. Specifically, we performed feature importance score
calculations for the RETAIN model on predicting mortality as a representative case.

12

First, we generated the feature importance scores comparing two models (RETAIN-CL against
RETAIN-CEL) over the 24-hour time frame for the full data set for mortality prediction. Fig. 5A
and B shows the normalized feature importance heat maps for CL and CEL with the columns
representing four 6-hour windows. These heat maps display similar importance scores in terms of
key features and their magnitudes. RETAIN identified lab tests and vital sign features that are
considered important by both loss models: pulse oximetry (0.26 for CEL, 0.21 for CL); asparate
aminotransferase (0.69 for CEL, 0.72 for CL); blood urea nitrogen (0.12 for CEL, 0.12 for CL);
lactate (0.24 for CEL, 0.23 for CL); lactate dehydrogenase (0.28 for CEL, 0.3 for CL). All these
parameters indicate important aspects of an ill COVID-19 patient.
We then generate feature importance scores using two loss functions for mortality prediction in
the restricted data set (i.e., down-sampling the positive label to 7%) for the RETAIN model. We
assess how the variable importance score changes under these different conditions for different
loss functions. The corresponding heat map is plotted in Fig. 5C and D. We observe that using CL
can still capture the highly scored features identified inthe full data set (i.e., weigh similar key
features). On the other hand, CEL fails to capture some important features. Of particular interest,
the importance of pulse oximetry is no longer prioritized in the restricted sample using CL
(importance value is 0.09 for CEL comparing to 0.35 for CL). Also, blood urea nitrogen, lactate
have lower importance values of 0.02, 0.09 for CEL compared to 0.15, 0.36 for CL. These findings
reaffirm our hypothesis with CL are more robust when the outcome labels are highly imbalanced.
Visualizing Patient Embeddings
Finally, we generated 2D t-SNE projections to compare patient embedding representations for
RETAIN models between the CL and CEL in predicting all three medical events within 24-hour
intervals and the results are shown in Fig. 4. The first two columns show patient embeddings using
the full sample data set, and the last two columns show embeddings for the restricted data set. Blue
dots represent positive labels and red dots represent negative labels. Models with both loss
functions show clear clustering of positive and negative labels in the full data sets. However, when
the data set is restricted (i.e., lowered positive labels), the model with CEL consistently show less
clear patterns and poorer clustering of patients for all outcomes. In contrast, the RETAIN model
with CL maintains its ability to group patients by their clinical outcomes.

13

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
In this work, we develop a new DL model based on the CL for predicting three critical events
(mortality, intubation, and ICU transfer) for COVID-19 patients using EHR data. Most DL-based
EHR analyses utilize CEL as part of modeling. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the
first studies to demonstrate the utility of CL in EHR predictive analyses. We demonstrate the
benefit of CL in multiple tasks with imbalanced outcome labels, which is particularly pertinent in
the context of COVID-19. We compare the performance of different sequential architectures (RNN
and RETAIN) for both CL and the conventional CEL model under two time window horizons. We
conduct further experiments for each outcome in a restricted data set of even more imbalanced
outcomes and show the benefit of CL is even more pronounced via three separate experimental
tasks, namely predictive performance, feature importance, and clustering.
The observed improvements in predictions come from the specific form of CL, which does not
only maximize the similarity between patient and outcome embedding representations, but also
maximizes the similarities between patient representations related to a specific outcome. However,
CEL mainly focuses on maximizing the similarity between patient and outcome one-hot
representations. Therefore, CL tends to maximize the margins between classes better than CEL.
The better margin classification ability of CL lead to higher performance for imbalanced data, for
which the classification is difficult due to poor margin classification of CEL in addition to
differences in data distributions for each class.
Our study contains several limitations which need to be addressed. First, we only compare CL to
one other loss function, although it is widely used. Second, we only assess two sequential modeling
techniques. Another main limitation of our study is excluding several laboratory values due to high
levels of missingness, which may impact some of our interpretations. Furthermore, we utilize a
specific time sequence modeling representation. Lastly, our work focuses only on one disease usecase. For future studies, other modeling architecture can be assessed to evaluate the
generalizability of our CL approach. Also, additional analysis is required to understand feature
importance differences between the loss functions and to determine if our CL methodology is
applicable to other healthcare data sets. We also plan to assess performance of this strategy for
predictive tasks in other diseases. We believe this work represents an effective demonstration of
the power of using CL for machine learning work for predictive tasks using EHRs.

Figure 1: Data and modeling schemas. A) Architecture with Contrastive Loss. Electronic health
record (EHR) data are modeled to create patient and event embedding representations which are
fed into our contrastive loss (CL) equation. B) Representation Space. CL simultaneously pushes
positive patients and event embeddings (i.e., concordant with respect to the outcome of the patient
of interest, respectively) away from negative ones. C) Time Binning. Schematic to visualize how
we model time sequence. We have two outcome windows (i.e., 24- and 48-hours prior to event)
and bin data by 6-hour chunks. D): Selection of Event Timing for Null Outcomes. For patients that
do not experience the outcome of interest, we generate a data-driven event time to align against as
in C. We compute the mean and standard deviation for the length of time that elapsed from
admission for all patients with the affiliated outcomes independently. For patients without an
event, we randomly pick a time to use as a reference end point using a Gaussian distribution with
the mean and standard deviation obtained from the positive training data.
