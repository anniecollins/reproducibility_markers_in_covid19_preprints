A BSTRACT
We investigate the historical series of the total number of deaths per month in Brazil since 2015 using
the wavelet transform, in order to assess whether the COVID-19 pandemic caused any change point
in that series. Our wavelet analysis shows that the series has a change point in the variance. However,
it occurred long before the pandemic began.

Introduction

Until the time of this writing, the Brazilian Federal Ministry of Health has recorded 3,846,153 Sars-CoV-2 case reports
and 120, 462 deaths caused by the COVID-19 pandemic [1] , [2].
According to the Coronavirus Resource Center of the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) [3], Brazil is the second country
most affected by COVID-19 in the world, both in number of cases and in number of deaths.
This article aims to investigate the historical series of the total number of deaths using the wavelet transform, which
is a powerful time-frequency domain signal processing tool [4]. From now on, such series will be referred simply as
historical series or signal .
Wavelet analysis is capable of solving problems, such as the detection of the change point in a signal (a transient
phenomena [5], [6]), which are difficult to approach with tools such as the Windowed Fourier Transform (WFT) [7].
A signal is any sequence of observations associated with an ordered independent variable t, which can be discrete or
continuous [4].
The signal is interrogated using wavelet analysis in order to answer the following questions: i) Does the series present
any change point(s)? ii) If there is a change point, what is its type (change in level, variance, etc. )? iii) If there is a
change point, did it occur during the COVID-19 pandemic?
The database used is that made available online by the Transparency Portal of the Civil Registry Offices of Brazil
[8], which consolidates the amount of birth, marriage and death certificates available in Brazil. Online data has been
available since January 2015. Brazilian registries are regulated by the National Council of Justice (CNJ), which is a
public institution headquartered in Brasília, Federal District, that aims to improve the work of the Brazilian judicial
system, especially with regard to administrative and procedural control and transparency [9]. The president of the
Brazilian Supreme Court also presides the CNJ.
The analysis was performed using the R software, version 4.0.2 [10] and the MATLAB© R2015a Wavelet Toolbox. The
R and MATLAB© codes, as well as the database in Excel spreadsheet format, are available for public consultation and
auditing on GitHub [11].

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents an overview of the Continuous and Discrete
Wavelet Transforms for the reader who is not familiar with the subject. If the reader is familiar with the theory of
wavelets, he or she may proceed to Section 3, which presents the experimental results. Finally, section 4 presents our
conclusions and and highlights some topics for further work.

Wavelets
The Continuous Wavelet Transform

The Fourier Transform (FT) of a signal x(t), t ∈ R (t denotes time), if exists, is defined as
Z

∞

x(t)e−j2πνt dt

X(ν) = TF{x(t)} =

(1)

−∞

in which ν denotes the frequency in cycles/second [Hz].
Gabor [12] has shown that it is possible to represent the local spectral content of a signal x(t) around an instant of time
τ by the Windowed Fourier Transform (WFT).
Z

∞

x(t)gT (t − τ )e−j2πνt dt ,

XT (ν, τ ) =

(2)

−∞

in which gT (t) is a window of finite duration support T and ν denotes frequency.
The WFT is a two-dimensional representation defined on the time-frequency domain (or plane) as it depends on the ν
and τ parameters. The WFT would be equivalent to a kind of continuous “sheet music” description of x(t).
According to the Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle [13, p.52], a signal whose energy content is quite well localized
in time has this energy quite spread out in the frequency domain. As the window of (2) has a fixed size T , we may
conclude that the WFT is not good to analyze (or identify) behaviors of x(t) occurring in time intervals much smaller
or much larger than T , as, for example, transient phenomena of duration ∆t << T or cycles that exist in periods larger
than T .
A wavelet ψ0 (t) (sometimes also called mother wavelet), t ∈ R, is a function that satisfies three conditions [4], [14].
1. Its Fourier transform Ψ(ν), −∞ < ν < ∞, is such that exists a finite constant Cψ that obeys the admissibility

Figure 1 shows four examples of wavelet functions: Haar, Daubechies, Coiflet and Symmlet. As the name suggests, a
wavelet is a ‘small wave’. A small wave grows and decays in a limited time period. On the other hand, an example of a
‘big wave’ is the cosine function cos t, which is ‘eternal’, i. e., keeps oscilating up and down for all t.
The wavelet transform is a relatively new tool for the analysis of signals, given that his mathematical theory was
formalized in the 1980s [15]. The wavelet transform has been originally developed as an analysis and synthesis tool of
continuous time energy signals [16], [17], [18], [19], [15], [20].

Presently, the wavelet transform has also been used as an analysis tool of discrete time signals.
There are continuous time and discrete time wavelet decompositions designate by Continuous Wavelet Transform
(CWT) and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT).
The CWT of a signal x(t) consists of a set C = {Wψ (s, τ ), s ∈ R+ , τ ∈ R}, in which
• τ is the time localization parameter,
• s represents scale, and
• ψ denotes a wavelet function,
of wavelet coefficients on the continuous time-scale plane (also known as time-frequency plane) given by

have the same energy (norm).
The basic idea of the CWT defined by (7) is to correlate1 a signal x(t) with shifted (by τ ) and dilated (by s) versions
of a mother wavelet (that has a pass-band spectrum). The CWT is a two parameters function. So, it is a redundant
transform, because it consists on mapping an one-dimension signal on the time-scale plane.

Differently from the WFT, where the reconstruction is made from the same family of functions as that used in the
analysis, in the CWT the synthesis is made with functions ψ̃s,τ that have to satisfy

The fundamental difference between the CWT and the WFT consists of the fact that the functions ψs,τ undergo dilations
and compressions [13]. The analysis on refined scales of time (small values of s) requires “fast” ψs,τ functions, i. e., of
a small support, while the analysis on aggregate scales of time (large values of s) requires “slower” ψs,τ functions, i. e.,
of a wider support.
 As already mentioned, the internal product defined by (7) is a measure of similarity between the
wavelet ψ t−τ
and the signal x(t) on a certain instant of time τ and on a determined scale s. For a fixed τ , large
s
values of s correspond to a low-frequency analysis, while small values of s are associated to a high-frequency analysis.
Therefore, the wavelet transform has a variable time resolution (i. e., the capacity of analyzing a signal from close “zoom in” - or from far - “zoom out”), being adequate to analyze phenomena that occur in different time scales.
Figure 2 provides an example of a CWT.

Figure 2: Analysis of an exponential discontinuity. The image on the bottom part of the figure is the CWT Wψ (s, τ ) of
the signal on the top part. The parameters τ = b and s = a vary along the horizontal and vertical axes, respectively.
Large (positive) values of wavelet coefficients are indicated in white. Note that the discontinuity produces large
coefficients in its respective cone of influence, which converge to the location of the singularity.
2.2

Multiresolution Analysis and the Discrete Wavelet Transform

There are two kinds of DWT:
• the DWT for discrete time signals; and
• the DWT for continuous time signals.
4

Covid 19 and A Wavelet Analysis of the Total Deaths per Month in Brazil since 2015

A P REPRINT

The DWT may be formulated for discrete time signals (as it is done, for example, by Percival and Walden [4]) without
establishing any explicit connection with the CWT. On the other hand, we should not understand the term “discrete” of
the DWT for continuous time signals as meaning that this transform is defined over a discrete time signal. But only that
the coefficients produced by this transform belong to a subset D = {wj,k = Wψ (2j , 2j k), j ∈ Z, k ∈ Z} of the set C
[14, p.105], [21].
In fact, the DWT coefficients for continuous time signals can also be directly obtained by means of the integral
wj,k

D
= ψ0(2j ,2j k) , x =

2−j/2 ψ0∗ (2−j λ − k)x(λ) dλ ,

(11)

−∞

in which the indices j and k are called scale and localization, respectively, does not involve any discrete time signal, but
the continuous time signal x(t).
Equation (11) shows that the continuous time DWT corresponds to a critically sampled version of the CWT defined by
(7) in the dyadic scales s = 2j , j = . . . , −1, 0, 1, 2, . . ., in which the instants of time in the dyadic scale s = 2j are
separated by multiples of 2j . The function ψ0 of (11) must be defined from a Multiresolution Analysis (MRA) of the
signal x(t) [4], [20], [22]. Observe that the continuous time MRA theory is similar to that of discrete time.
In this paper, we decided, for mere convenience, to present the continuous time MRA version based on the spectral
analysis of a “fictitious” signal {x̃t , t ∈ R} that is associated to the discrete time series {xn , n ∈ Z} [21].
Figure 3 shows the critical sampling of the time-scale plane by means of the CWT parameters (s = 2j e τ = 2j k)
discretization.

Figure 3: Critical sampling of the time-scale plane by means of the CWT parameters (s = 2j e τ = 2j k) discretization.
A MRA is, by definition, a sequence of closed subspaces {Vj }j∈Z of L2 (R) such that [4, p.462], [20]:
1. . . . V2 ⊂ V1 ⊂ V0 ⊂ V−1 ⊂ V−2 ⊂ . . .;

2. j∈Z Vj = {};
S
3. j∈Z Vj = L2 (R);
4. x(t) ∈ Vj ⇔ x(2j t) ∈ V0 , j > 0 (in which t denotes time and x(t) is an energy signal);
5. There is a function φj (t) = 2−j/2 φ0 (2−j t) in Vj , called scale function, such that the set {φj,k , k ∈ Z} is an
orthonormal basis of Vj , with φj,k (t) = 2−j/2 φ0 (2−j t − k) ∀j, k ∈ Z.
The subspace Vj is known as the approximation space associated to the time scale sj = 2j (assuming that V0 is the
approximation space with unit scale).
If the x(t) projection on Vj is represented by the scale coefficients

then properties 1 and 3 assure that lim

Property 4 implies that the subspace Vj is a scaled version of subspace V0 (multiresolution).

As Vj+1 ⊂ Vj , Sj+1 (t) is a coarser approximation of x(t) than Sj (t).
This fact illustrates the MRA’s fundamental idea, that consists in examining the loss of information when one goes from
Sj (t) to Sj+1 (t):
Sj (t) = Sj+1 (t) + ∆xj+1 (t).

(14)

∆xj+1 (t) (called detail of xj (t)) belongs to the subspace Wj+1 , named detail space [4] that is associated to the
fluctuations (or variations) of the signal in the more refined time scale sj = 2j and that corresponds to the orthogonal
complement of Vj+1 in Vj 2 .
The MRA shows that the detail signals ∆xj+1 (t) = Dj+1 (t) may be directly obtained by successive projections of the
original signal x(t) over wavelet subspaces Wj .
Besides, the MRA theory shows that exists a function ψ0 (t), called “mother wavelet” , that is obtained from φ0 (t), in
which ψj,k (t) = 2−j/2 φ0 (2−j t − k) , k ∈ Z, is an orthonormal basis of Wj .
The detail Dj+1 (t) is obtained by the equation
Dj+1 (t) =

ψj+1,k (t) hψj+1,k (t), x(t)i .

(15)

k

The internal product hψj+1,k (t), x(t)i = wj+1,k denotes the wavelet coefficient associated to scale j + 1 and discrete
time k and {ψj+1,k (t)} is a family of wavelet functions that generates the subspace Wj+1 , orthogonal to subspace Vj+1
(Wj+1 ⊥Vj+1 ), i. e.,
hψj+1,n , φj+1,p i = 0 , ∀n, p.
(16)
Therefore, the detail signal Dj+1 (t) belongs to the complementary subspace Wj+1 of Vj , because
Vj = Vj+1 ⊕ Wj+1 .

(17)

That is, Vj is given by the direct addition of Vj+1 and Wj+1 , and this means that any element in Vj may be determined
from the addition of two orthogonal elements belonging to Vj+1 and Wj+1 . Iterating (17), we have
Vj = Wj+1 ⊕ Wj+2 ⊕ . . .

The MRA of a continuous time signal x(t) is initiated by determining the coefficients3 u0 (k) = hφ0,k (t), x(t)i, in
which k = 0, 1, . . . , N − 1, that are associated to the projection of x(t) on the approximation subspace V0 .
Following, the sequence {u0 (k)} is decomposed by filtering and sub-sampling by a factor of 2 (downsampling) in
two sequences: {u1 (k)} and {w1 (k)}, each one with N/2 points. This filtering and sub-sampling process is repeated
several times, producing the sequences
{{u0 (k)}N , {u1 (k)} N , {u2 (k)} N , . . . , {uj (k)} Nj , . . . , {uJ (k)} NJ }

Besides, Wj+1 is contained in the subspace Vj .
The sequence u0 (k) is obtained sampling the filter’s output whose impulse response is φ∗ (−t) (matched filter with a function

Figure 6 shows the QMF filters frequency response related to a Daubechies wavelet of order 10 (db10).

Figure 6: QMF filters frequency response.
According to (28), the MRA departs from a definition (from several possible) of the scale function φ(t), that is related
to the scale filter gn by (27). Eq. (36) says that the choice of a FIR-type filter {gn } implies a {hn } that is also FIR. At
last, the wavelet function is determined by (31).
The scale φ(t) and wavelet ψ(t) functions associated to the FIR filters {gn } and {hn } have compact support, thus
offering the time resolution functionality. The simplest scale function that satisfies (25) is the characteristic function of
the interval I = [0, 1), that corresponds to the Haar’s scale function:

Ingrid Daubechies [15] was the first one to propose a method for building sequences of transfer functions
(N )
{G(N ) (z)}N =1,2,3,... and {H (N ) (z)}N =1,2,3,... , in which G(N ) (z) is associated to the low-pass FIR filter gn and
(N )
H (N ) (z) to the high-pass filter hn . The corresponding scale and wavelet functions have support in [0, 2N − 1]. The
first member of the sequence is the Haar system φ(1) = φ(H) , ψ (1) = ψ (H) . The Daubechies’ filters are generalizations
of the Haar system for N ≥ 2 [13].

Figure 7: The graphs in the lower part show the Daubechies’ wavelets with N = 2, 3, 4 vanishing moments, from left to
right, respectively. The corresponding scale functions are in the upper part.
We can demonstrate that [17]:

(42)

h(k − 2n)uj−1 (k) .

(43)

k

and that
wj (n) =

k

According to (42) and (43), we can obtain the coefficients uj (n) and wj (n) from the scale coefficients uj−1 (m) by
means of decimation operation of the sequence {uj−1 (m)} by a factor of 2. The decimation consists in cascading a
low-pass filter g(−m) (with a transfer function Ḡ(z) = G(1/z) and frequency response G∗ (f )) or a high-pass h(−m)
(with transfer function H̄(z) = H(1/z) and frequency response H ∗ (f )) with a compressor (or decimator) by a factor
of 2. Decimate a signal by a factor D is the same as to reduce its sampling rate by D times.
The MRA is implemented by a low-pass and high-pass analysis filter banks G∗ (f ) and H ∗ (f ) adequately positioned
for separating the scale and wavelet coefficients sequences. This is known in the literature as the pyramid algorithm
presented by Mallat [17]. Later, it is possible to rebuild the original signal using dual QMF reconstruction filter banks,
low-pass G(f ) and high-pass H(f ).
It is important to emphasize that the pyramid algorithm’s complexity is O(N ) (assuming we want to evaluate the DWT
of N samples), while the direct evaluation of the DWT (that involves matrices multiplication) is O(N 2 ) [4].
Figure 8 shows the QMF analysis filter banks G∗ (f ) (low-pass) and H ∗ (f ) (high-pass) with decimation (downsampling)
by a factor of 2. Figure 9 shows the QMF reconstruction filter banks with interpolation (upsampling) by a factor of 2.
Observe that are used dual low-pass and high-pass filters, G(f ) and H(f ).

Experimental Results

In section 2, we described how the DWT can be applied to a signal x(t). However, the purpose of this study requires that
we think of x(t) as a realization of a stochastic process {x(t)}, so that we can be able to realize a statistical assessment
of the change point. The reader interested in the definition of a stochastic process can consult the reference [24] for
more information.

A P REPRINT

In the paper [24], we showed that the signal of Fig. 13 obeys a model of the type [25][p. 58]
x(t) = µ(t) + y(t),

(44)

where x(t) are the observations, y(t) is a stationary process, and µ(t) denotes a linear trend given by the regression
model
µ(t) = β0 + β1 t

(45)

in which β0 and β1 are the intercept and the slope parameters. We also estimated an autoregressive model of order 11
(AR(11)) for y(t). An AR(11) is said to exhibit short-range dependence, as the Power Spectral Density (PSD) of the
signal does not have 1/f behavior for frequencies near to zero (Long Range Dependence (LRD)).
In [24], we conclude that there are no change points in the slope of the historical series and in the mean of the series
that corresponds to the first difference of the historical series.
Table 1 shows the estimated coeffcientes for (45) and its p-values. Figure 14 shows the historical series with the
superimposed linear regression model.

Figure 14: Historical series with the superimposed linear regression model.
As in [24], the first step in wavelet analysis requires that the deterministic trend of the historical series be removed, in
order to perform the time-frequency domain analysis [25][p. 58]. There are two alternatives: remove the line estimated
by the regression or take the first difference in the series. As our goal is to coerce the data to (a possible) stationarity,
then differencing may be more appropriate [25][p. 61]. The first two samples of the historical series were discarded so
that the series corresponding to the first difference has 64 points, that is, 26 points, which is appropriate for a wavelet
analysis with the DWT.
The first difference can be denote as
∆x(t) = x(t) − x(t − 1) = r(t).

(46)

Figure 15 shows the series r(t) (we also demeaned it).
Now, as far as a qualitative analysis is concerned, we have to focus our wavelet (graphical) analysis on the most refined
scales of the time-frequency doman, where possible changes in variance can be localized. This is the intuition behind

where we assume that r(t) has Nj nonboundary wavelet coefficients wj (Lj ), wj (Lj + 1), . . . , wj (Nj − 1), in which

Nj = Nj − Lj .
Figs. 16 and 17 show the LA(8) DWT of signal rt and its wavelet tree, respectively. The wavelet coefficients of the node
(1, 1) of the tree in Fig.17 are between the frequencies 1/4 and 1/2. The change point is indicated by the blue arrow
(t = 22) in Fig. 16. Note that this point is localized just before the maximum value of the set of coefficients {w1 (k)} 64
.

The LA(8) wavelet has an approximate linear phase, which facilitates the alignment of the wavelet coefficients with the
signal of interest. Thus, this strategy is often a good choice when we want to detect a change point in the signal [4, p.
136].
Here is a noteworthy example of an important advantage of wavelet analysis over Fourier. Should the same signal had
been analyzed by the FT, we would not have been able to detect the instant of the change point, whereas it is clearly
observable here.
Now, let us compare the plot of the raw data along with the level-one wavelet detail signal (D1) in Fig. 18 (LA(8)
MRA), which indicates the existence of a change in variance
t = 22 (2017/jan), see the red arrow. Remember
 around

that the detail signal D1 is located in the frequency band 14 , 12 . Fig. 19 illustrates the Haar MRA. Note that we can
also see change in variance around t = 22 (2017/jan) in the level-one wavelet detail signal.
Now we can confirme our qualitative analysis using the function wvarchg() (MATLAB© R2015a Wavelet Toolbox),
which calculates the optimal positioning and (potentially) number of changepoints. As the signal r(t) is SRD, there is
no need to be concerned with the question of sampling of the variance of the wavelet coefficients, which is problematic
for long memory process [4, p. 380].
The test confirms that there is a change point in variance in t = 22.

Conclusions and Future Work

In this paper, we presented an overview of the Continuos and Discrete Wavelet Transforms, and a wavelet analysis of
the historical series of the total number of deaths per month in Brazil since 2015. Our preliminary results indicate that:
• the variance of the signal changed in january of 2017; however, this change point occurred before the outbreak
of the COVID-19 pandemic; and

• there is no evidence that COVID-19 provoked a change in the stochastic process that generates the historical
series, as there are no change points in this signal after the outbreak of COVID-19 in Brazil, which happened
in the beginning of march, 2020.
There is no doubt that COVID-19 has caused the deaths of many people around the world. Many who survived will
have to live with sequelae in the brain, kidneys, lungs and heart. In addition, the world population is being subjected to
a high degree of stress, due to fear of the new coronavirus, economic/financial problems, etc.
However, our results suggest that COVID-19 did not cause any change point in the brazilian series of the total number of
deaths per month in Brazil since 2015 so far. What would be a plausible explanation for this strange result? Answering
this question requires a multidisciplinary approach, as it involves several areas of knowledge such as medicine, signal
processing, statistics etc.
Nevertheless, researchers in the area must continue to monitor the behavior of the historical series in Brazil.
In future work, we suggest the application of the Maximal Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transform (MODWT) and the
Discrete Wavelet Packet Transform (DWPT) [4] to the brazilian historical series. We would also like to analyze the
series from other countries affected by COVID-19.
