ABSTRACT
During the course of an epidemic, one of the most challenging tasks for authorities is to decide what kind of restrictive measures to introduce and when these should be enforced. In order to take informed decisions in a fully rational manner, the
onset of a critical regime, characterized by an exponential growth of the contagion, must be identified as quickly as possible.
Providing rigorous quantitative tools to detect such an onset represents an important contribution from the scientific community to proactively support the political decision makers. In this paper, leveraging the quickest detection theory, we propose
a mathematical model of the COVID-19 pandemic evolution and develop decision tools to rapidly detect the passage from
a controlled regime to a critical one. A new sequential test —referred to as MAST (mean-agnostic sequential test) — is
presented, and demonstrated on publicly available COVID-19 infection data from different countries. Then, the performance
of MAST is investigated for the second pandemic wave, showing an effective trade-off between average decision delay ∆ and
risk R, where R is inversely proportional to the time required to declare the need to take unnecessary restrictive measures. We
find that all the countries share the same behaviour in terms of quickest detection, specifically the risk scales exponentially
with the delay, R ∼ exp (−ω ∆), where ω depends on the specific nation. For a reasonably small risk level, say, one possibility in ten thousand (i.e., unmotivated implementation of countermeasures every 27 years, on the average), the proposed
algorithm detects the onset of the critical regime with delay between a few days to three weeks, much earlier than when the
exponential growth becomes evident. Strictly from the quickest-detection perspective adopted in this paper, it turns out that
countermeasures against the second epidemic wave have not always been taken in a timely manner. The developed tool
can be used to support decisions at different geographic scales (regions, cities, local areas, etc.), levels of risk, instantiations
of controlled/critical regime, and is general enough to be applied to different pandemic time-series. Additional analysis and
applications of MAST are made available on a dedicated website.

Introduction
With more than 57 million cases worldwide and over one and 1.36 million deaths as of November 20, 2020, the outbreak
of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is undeniably one of the worst global crises since World War II. In March 2020, the
exponential increase of individuals needing hospitalization in intensive care units, combined with the lack of effective cures
and vaccines, pushed many governments to take extraordinary measures aimed at “flattening the curve” of infections.1–3 The
adopted measures included the limitation of mobility and social activities, closure of schools, universities, shops, factories,
and so forth, up to the extreme act of national lockdowns. Evidence that such measures achieved a reduction of the rate of
new infections are gradually appearing in the scientific literature.4–6
These measures contributed to keep the spread of COVID-19 under control for some time, but we are now, in November
2020, experiencing the onset of a new exponential growth of confirmed cases, the “second wave,” with severe risks for
personal health and healthcare systems under severe stress. Governments and authorities are facing again the difficult task of
deciding if and when new containment measures may be needed. In absence of limitations to mobility and social activities,
the pandemic spreads exponentially in time, so that any delay in applying restrictions may lead to severe consequences. On
the other hand, accounting for the social and economic impact of the possible countermeasures, already observed in the first
half of 2020,7–10 restrictions should be taken only if and when it is strictly necessary. Managing the trade-off between these
contrasting requirements is extremely challenging.
To address this challenge, we leverage sequential detection theory,11–13 and specifically quickest detection schemes14–16 to
propose a rigorous methodology aimed at identifying as quickly as possible the onset of an exponential growth of the pandemic

Figure 1. Number of COVID-19 daily new positives in the first and the second wave of the pandemic for several nations.
Each curve is normalized by the initial value and shifted to the same initial time. The initial point of the first wave for a
specific nation is when the first positives are reported, while the initial point of the second wave is when the daily positives
start to increase again — growth rate larger than one. The first wave, upper region (shaded in red), was more aggressive than
the second wave, mostly confined to the lower region (shaded in blue). These two regions are delimited by different values of
α in Eq. (1). Curves of each nation are dashed if related to the first wave otherwise solid if related to the second wave.
evolution. The proposed procedure — referred to as MAST (mean-agnostic sequential test) — is designed to minimize the
average time to detect a change in regime:14–16 from a situation in which the pandemic is under control (H0 regime) to the
onset of an exponential growth (H1 regime).
Quickest detection theory has a long history,17 and has been successfully applied in several fields, including quality control,
climate modeling, remote sensing, financial analysis, image analysis, security, signal and speech processing, and biomedical
applications.15, 16 In the context of public health surveillance, where the timely detection of various types of adverse health
events is crucial, quickest detection techniques have found several applications,18 e.g., to reveal the onset and the peak of the
epidemic period19 or that the peak is over.20
The approach pursued in this article is substantially different from most of the epidemiological models, based for instance
on stochastic evolution of epidemic compartments4, 6, 21–23 and metapopulation networks,24, 25 where the goal is to predict the
mid/long-term behavior of the outbreak. For instance, in stochastic compartmental models, given an initial condition, the
epidemic can have two outcomes: the number of infected individuals can increase, in which case we have a major outbreak,
or decrease. The probability of a major outbreak can be computed,26 but it is of limited use in taking timely on-line decisions.
The importance of taking a decision as quickly as possible in an epidemic scenario can be understood by looking at the
curve of daily cases of COVID-19 infection, reported in Fig. 1 for several nations.27 In the same figure we also report the
deterministic curves of daily cases, with an exponential growth described by the following equation
pn+1 = pn (1 + α ) = p1 (1 + α )n ,

n = 1, 2, . . . ,

(1)

where n is the time index (day), 1 + α is the growth rate, and α > 0, which corresponds to the H1 regime of a major outbreak.
This exponential behavior is equivalent to a recently-proposed disease-transmission model,28 and the reproduction number
defined therein is equivalent to the growth rate. All the curves in Fig. 1 are normalized to the initial value p1 and shifted to
the same initial time. Figure 1 shows that first wave was noticeably more aggressive than the second one in terms of growth
rate; specifically, in the first wave α was varied by country but ranged between 0.06 and 0.40, while in the second wave it is
between 0.01 and 0.06.
In the latter scenario, any delay in revealing the onset of an exponential growth phase and the consequent implementation
of containment measures produces a costly exponential increase of the number of new cases. In other words, it is essential
to reduce as much as possible the decision delay to level off the curve of infection as early as possible. At the same time,

it is important to enforce restrictions only if essential, in order to avoid unnecessary social unrest and economic cost. And,
inevitably, any detection procedure under the controlled regime H0 can produce false alarms, i.e., it can wrongly declare the
upcoming onset of an exponential growth phase. The risk of taking a wrong decision can be quantified by the inverse of the
mean time between false alarms. Balancing between detection delay and risk represents a fundamental system trade-off. In
this paper, we consider a relatively simple, but effective, mathematical model of the pandemic and develop a decision tool
to quickly detect the passage from a controlled regime to a critical one. Its effectiveness in terms of delay/risk trade-off is
demonstrated on publicly available COVID-19 data from several countries. It is our hope that the proposed MAST procedure
can be useful in making timely and rational decisions to control the pandemic evolution.

Results
The main result of this research is the design of the MAST quickest-detection procedure, which is specifically tailored to
epidemic scenarios, and its application on COVID-19 data. In this context, we show that the mean time ∆ required to reveal
the onset of an exponential phase is in the order of a few days (or few weeks), with a risk R that scales exponentially with the
delay:
R ∼ exp(−ω ∆),

(2)

where the symbol "∼" refers to asymptotic behaviour (small R, large ∆), and ω is a parameter whose value varies from country
to country. This exponential relationship holds for most optimal quickest detection procedures under specific mathematical
conditions and optimality criteria.14 In this work, we show empirically that this optimality condition is verified by the MAST
procedure when applied to the COVID-19 data, despite the fact that MAST is designed to work in the presence of uncertainty
and non-stationarity of the data statistics.
To illustrate these concepts, let us refer to Fig. 2, where data from Italy are considered. Panel (a) shows the curve of daily
positives from Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 data,27 along with the smoothed version thereof, shown in green. Using
the latter, we obtain the sequence of growth rates x1 , x2 , . . . , shown in panel (b) (green curve) as the ratio of two consecutive
values of daily positives, with its smoothed version (in magenta); see the data model in Eq. (3).
In Fig. 2(a), we note that the peak of the first wave is smaller than the second one, which is likely due to the smaller
number of swabs made during the first wave. In other words, in the two waves we are observing different fractions of the total
infected populations. This difference does not affect our analysis because the sequence x1 , x2 , . . . , of growth rates are ratios of
successive daily positives.
As discussed in the Methods section and illustrated in the notional scheme of Fig. 5, the proposed MAST procedure takes
as input the sequence x1 , x2 , . . . and recursively computes the sequence of decision statistics T1 , T2 , . . . , see Eq. (7), where Tn
only depends on the observed growth rates x1 , . . . , xn , up to day n. It is worth stressing that the growth rate process x1 , . . . , xn ,
is assumed to be Gaussian distributed with unknown and time-varying mean value sequence. The MAST decision statistic
is “mean-agnostic,” because it does not require knowledge of the time evolution of such a mean sequence, and it is therefore
robust to its deterministic fluctuations.

Stopping Day
Figure 3. Application of the MAST procedure on the COVID-19 pandemic data from Italy. On the left-side vertical axis,
we select a decision threshold to correspond to a desired risk, e.g., R = 10−4. Then, the blue curve indicates the stopping day
(about July 18, in the example) corresponding to the selected value of risk. Finally, the red curve referred to the right-side
vertical axis shows the mean delay ∆ corresponding to the selected risk R (about 3 days). For clarity, note that the right-side
scale for the delay is split into two linear ranges, for a better rendering of the small-∆ range.

The onset of the critical regime is declared by the MAST at the smallest index n such that Tn > χ , where χ is a threshold
level. Panel (c) of Fig. 2 shows the corresponding decision performance. The left axis reports the risk R as a function of the
threshold value χ , and the right axis reports the mean delay of decision ∆, again as a function of χ . We see that the function
R(χ ) is exponentially decreasing, while ∆(χ ) is linearly increasing, consistent with Eq. (2) and with known relationships for
Page’s test and other quickest-detection procedures.14, 15
Combining the evidence shown in Fig. 2, we obtain Fig. 3 that can be interpreted as follows. The blue curve refers to the
left-side vertical axis, while the red curve refers to the right-side vertical axis. Starting from a given level of risk selected on
the left-side vertical axis, we find the stopping day of MAST, which is the day on which the onset of the critical regime is
declared (first threshold crossing). Then, referring to the red curve, one obtains the corresponding delay ∆ on the right-side
vertical axis. This is the mean delay incurred by the MAST procedure in declaring the onset of the critical regime. The
interpretation of ∆ is that the passage to the exponential growth of the pandemic takes place, on the average, ∆ days before the
alert produced by MAST. In Fig. 3, values of the risk smaller than 10−9 are collapsed to R = 10−9 , because for R ≤ 10−9 we
can safely assume that risk is essentially negligible. It is worth noting that, even at negligible risk level, the stopping day is
approximately July 27, and the corresponding mean delay is less than 8 days.
The analysis in Figs. 2-3 can be repeated for other regions, yielding similar insights. We report the cases of: United States
of America in Fig. 7; United Kingdom in Fig. 8; France in Fig. 9; and Germany in Fig. 10. Note that in the United States, there
exists also a third wave of the pandemic, which we analyze separately in Fig. 7(d), by restarting the test after declaring the
onset of the second wave. (Actually, such a third wave is likely to be a delayed second wave in different geographic regions of
the U.S., as a state-by-state analysis seems to imply.) Additional analysis on data from more geographical regions is available
online29 and updated regularly.
A comparison of the MAST performance for 14 different nations is addressed in Fig. 4. Different decision performances
reflect different values of the parameter ω governing the relationship between risk and delay, shown in Eq. (2). We see that,
accepting a risk of R = 10−4 , the mean detection delay ∆ is about 3 days for Netherlands and below 20 days for Spain. Thus,
the MAST procedure detects an outbreak very expeditiously at very low risk level.
The outer black curves labeled by ω = 0.32 and ω = 11.52 represent the ideal performance of the Page’s test (see Eq. (6)),
in which the mean values of the growth rates x1 , x2 , . . . , are assumed constant, known in advance, and equal to (1 + α )
under H1 and (1 − α ) under H0 . For such a scenario, the parameter ω appearing in Eq. (2) is the Kullback–Leibler distance
2 (α /σ )2 between the distributions under the two regimes.14, 30 To provide performance envelopes, we use the values α = 0.01

Figure 4. Operational curve — risk versus mean delay for decision — for 14 Countries. For large ∆, the operational curve is
described by Eq. (2), namely R ∼ exp(−ω ∆). The outermost black curves correspond to the ideal performance of the Page’s
test, assuming known and constant growth rate, with α = 0.01 and 0.06, respectively (extreme values of α for the second
wave, see Fig. 1). Each nation is characterized by a specific value of ω (reported between brackets on the legend), and all
values of ω lie in the range between ω = 0.32 and ω = 11.52.
and α = 0.06 corresponding to the extreme growth rates of the second wave reported in Fig. 1, and set σ = 0.025, which is the
arithmetic mean of the estimated standard deviations of the 14 countries. For the two values of α , this yields 2 (α /σ )2 = 0.32
and 11.52, respectively, which are the values reported in Fig. 4. By setting ω = 2 (α /σ )2 in Eq. (2) we observe that the higher
is the growth rate, the better is the detection capability for a given risk. In other words, consistent with intuition, the more
aggressive is the outbreak, the more quickly it can be detected. On the other hand, the larger is σ , the higher is the delay for
a given risk. Also this effect is intuitive, because the standard deviation σ measures the entity of random fluctuations in the
data x1 , x2 , . . . , and reliable decisions require more time because the data is uncertain. These trade-offs are also observed for
the MAST test run over COVID-19 data for different nations, and are captured by the parameter ω in Eq. (2).

Discussion
Let us focus again on Italy, and set R = 10−4. Accepting a risk in the order of R = 10−4 means that there is one chance in ten
thousand that the countermeasures are taken too early or, in other words, unjustified actions against the pandemic are adopted
every 27 years, on the average. By taking drastic countermeasures on July 18 — the stopping day prescribed by our MAST
procedure for R = 10−4 — we would have left only ∆ ≈ 3 days of uncontrolled exponential growth of the pandemic, before
addressing it. In this respect, it should be noted that the adoption of severe countermeasures in Italy has been decided only at
the beginning of November 2020. The delayed decision situation is analogous for other nations.
It is clear that managing an unprecedented pandemic event is a huge and a multifaceted problem, which can only be
addressed by taking into account many different perspectives. It is also clear that the decision when to take pandemic countermeasures depends on a large number of societal factors. The contribution of this article is limited to the analysis of the
pandemic strictly from a quickest-detection viewpoint and, from this perspective, we obtain useful insights and quantitative
analyses. One evidence, as just pointed out, is that critical regimes of many nations began dramatically earlier than when
countermeasures were taken.
Aside from the above retrospective analysis, a major contribution of the MAST quickest detection tool developed in this
paper consists of providing proactive decision support for detecting future waves of the COVID-19 outbreak, and the onset
of future pandemics. In these cases, precise nation-dependent performance predictions, such as those given in Fig. 4, cannot
be available in advance because the curves have been obtained by exploiting estimates of the mean value of the growth rate
(see e.g., the curve in magenta in Fig 2), derived by forensic inspection of the data. However, good approximate performance
bounds can be obtained by assuming constant growth rates (1 ± α ) in the critical and controlled regime, respectively, for
“reasonable” values of α , for instance, the faster and the slower rates reported in Fig. 2 and used to compute the outermost
black curves in Fig. 4. The corresponding value of ω would be equal to the Kullback–Leibler information measure, which

mitigate imperfections in data collection, randomness, and delays. Filtered daily positive pn are used to compute the growth

governs the performance of a clairvoyant Page’s test that knows exactly the constant growth rate.
Figure 5 shows the flowchart of the MAST procedure. The filtering operation in Fig. 5 is important to mitigate gross
errors and lack or delayed reporting of the input data. To compute pn , the filtering operation used in this paper requires one to
observe data samples beyond the current day n, which causes delays for on-line implementations. In these cases, alternative
causal filtering strategies31 are more appropriate.
The quickest-detection tool developed can also be applied to different time-series, other than the sequence of growth rate
of daily new positives {xn }, for instance to the daily new hospitalized individuals addressed, for the Italian case, in Fig. 6.
The sequence of daily new hospitalized individuals does not require the smoothing operation shown in the flowchart of Fig. 5,
because the collected data are less affected by gross errors. These data are also normally distributed with good accuracy,
as confirmed by goodness-of-fit analysis (not reported). In Fig. 6 we see that the decision taken by using the hospitalized
sequence is delayed as compared to that obtained by the sequence of daily new positives. This behaviour is intuitive because
the hospitalized individuals are a subset of the positive ones, and a possible hospitalization follows the onset of clinical
symptoms.
The possibility of processing different sequences of data opens the way to the design of more sophisticated decision
rules based on joint processing of multiple time-series. In addition, the MAST procedure can easily accommodate different
definitions of critical regime. For instance, if a pandemic growth at rate (1 + α ∗ ) is considered acceptable, for some 0 < α ∗ ≪
1, the critical regime can be characterized by rates exceeding (1 + α ∗ ), rather than 1. The necessary modifications to the
MAST statistic are straightforward. We also envision that considering both the passage from a controlled to a critical regime
and vice versa can be addressed by minor modifications to the MAST procedure. All these extensions are left for future work.
An extended analysis of COVID-19 infection data from more countries than those covered in this paper is available on the
web.29
Finally, we hope that in the near future the publicly available data can be: (i) more reliable so as to mitigate bias effects
due to, e.g., false positives, contrasting multiple test outcomes for the same individual, markedly different contagion incidence
in close geographical areas, etc.; and (ii) released with finer granularity so as to allow for analyses stratified by population age,
comorbidity, etc. These aspects are also relevant to the design of effective vaccination policies.

Methods
The observation model used in this paper can be formally obtained by replacing the constant growth rate (1 + α ) appearing in
Eq. (1) by the sequence of random variables x1 , x2 , . . . , yielding

where pn is the number of new cases on day n, while xn = pn+1 /pn , a time-series that makes explicit the growth rate that we
seek to coopt. The model in Eq. (3) is validated empirically. In particular, in the accompanying Supplementary Information,
we elaborate on the classic susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) compartmental epidemic model to motivate the usage of the
sequence {xn } as observable process for quickest detection. Using the model in Eq. (3), we assume to have available the

sequence of daily new positives, for a certain region of interest; the analysis presented here relies on the data provided by the
Johns Hopkins University.27 Referring for instance to Fig. 2, such a sequence is shown in gray in the left panel. To address
gross errors, missing values and delays in reporting the data, the sequence is smoothed by a moving average filter with uniform
weights (the moving average filter of length L is always assumed to have equal 1/L weights). By trial and error, we select the
length L of the filter to be 21 days, and the smoothed sequence {pn } so obtained is shown in green in Fig. 2(a). The growth
rate process used as observable is then computed as {xn = pn+1 /pn }, and is represented by the green curve in Fig. 2(b). The
time-varying statistical mean {µn } of the sequence can be estimated by low-pass filtering of the sequence {xn }, and for this

we use again a moving average filter of length L = 21 days. By subtracting from each xn the estimated mean value µ

goodness-of-fit test32 reveals that xn − µ
with (country-dependent) standard deviation σ ≪ 1. Since µn is close to unity, we see that xk < 0 with negligible probability,
hence the Gaussian approximation should not be problematic.
By observing the sequence {xn } as time n elapses, we want to detect the passage from the controlled regime H0 , to the
critical regime H1 , when there is the exponential growth. In the controlled regime, the mean value of the random variable xn
is below one, i.e., µn = µ0,n ≤ 1, meaning that the number of new positives remains approximately stable or decreases.
Conversely, in the critical regime, the mean value is greater than unity, µn = µ1,n > 1, which implies an explosion of daily
new positives in the long run. Formally:

We assume that the xk ’s are mutually independent under either regime.1 Different nations are characterized by different values
of σ , hence for each country σ is assumed known, because in practice it can be estimated on-line from the data. Conversely,
the quantities {µ0,n } and {µ1,n } are modeled as deterministic but unknown sequences.

we show in the accompanying Supplementary Information, slight deviations from the condition of perfect independence do not significantly affect
the results of the proposed MAST.

To detect the change of regime, we rely on the Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT) approach,11–13 a milestone of
decision theory in scenarios where the statistical distributions of the data contain unknown parameters — in our case, the
sequences of mean values {µ0,n } and { µ1,n }, and the time at which the passage of regime occurs. If we assume the sequences
of mean values in the two regimes to be constant and known, say µ0,n = 1 − α and µ1,n = 1 + α (cf. equation (1)), the
GLRT solution to the quickest-detection problem would be the celebrated Page’s test: compare to an appropriate threshold the
CUSUM statistic14, 15, 17

, n ≥ 1.
In the presence of unknown and time-varying sequences complying with the constraints on µ0,n and µ1,n , shown in (4)-(5), the
GLRT solution to the quickest-detection problem amounts to compare the MAST statistic Tn to a threshold χ :33

and declaring the change of regime at the first occurrence of the threshold crossing. It is worth noting that the MAST statistic
bn = |xn − 1|
is formally obtained by replacing the unknown value of α appearing in the CUSUM statistic, with the estimate α
(constant factors can be incorporated in the threshold). The reader educated in detection theory will recognize the analogy
with the energy detector arising in testing the presence of an unknown time-varying deterministic signal buried in Gaussian
noise.34
The threshold χ employed in the MAST procedure is selected to trade-off decision delay ∆ and risk R, two quantities that
are defined as follows. The mean delay ∆ is the mean value of the difference between the time at which the MAST statistic
crosses the threshold χ and the time of passage from the controlled to the critical regime. The risk R is defined as reciprocal
of the mean time between successive false alarms (in fact, “false alarm probability” is perhaps a more familiar jargon to
readers with background in detection theory), where the false alarm is defined as a threshold crossing during the controlled
regime (i.e., the regime in which there is no need for intervention). In this paper, the functions R(χ ) and ∆(χ ) are obtained by
standard Monte Carlo simulations12, 26, 34 for relatively small values of χ , see e.g., Fig. 2(c). We found that the first function
is essentially exponential, and the second is essentially linear, consistent with known expressions for the Page’s test.14, 15 This
allows us to extrapolate the behaviour of the two functions for values of χ that would be problematic to obtain from real data
or by computer experiments, such as those used in Fig. 3 and similar figures for other nations.

Observation Model
Classical Deterministic SIR

Let us start, for the sake of simplicity, from the classical Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model of epidemic spread;
a similar discussion holds for more complicated compartmental models. There are P individuals (for concreteness, this may
be the population of a state or a country), grouped into three classes, or compartments: susceptible S(t), infected I(t), and
removed (or recovered) R(t). Let s(t) = S(t)/P, i(t) = I(t)/P and r(t) = R(t)/P, denote the corresponding fractions of
individuals. Each susceptible individual infects, on the average, β randomly-chosen other individuals per unit of time. Each
infected individual will then recover (or, unfortunately, pass away) at a constant average rate γ . The popular SIR model6, 21, 26
is formalized mathematically as follows
 ds(t)

 dt

di(t)
dt

 dr(t)
dt

= −β s(t)i(t),
= β s(t)i(t) − γ i(t),
= γ i(t),

(8)

with initial conditions r(0) = 0, s(0) = 1 − i(0); i(0) is a (fairly small) fraction of the total population that gives rise to
the spread of the infection. Note that one of the three equations in (8) is redundant, in view of the conservation constraint
r(t)+ s(t)+ i(t) = 1. Dividing the first of (8) by s(t) and solving for i(t) from the third equation, one gets d log s(t) = − βγ dr(t).
The quantity β /γ goes also under the name of contact number and is a combined characteristic of the population and the
disease. Also, using i(t) = 1 − r(t) − s(t) in the third equation, we eliminate i(t) and arrive at

β
s(t) = s(0)e− γ r(t) ,
h
i
(9)
β
 dr(t) = γ 1 − r(t) − s(0)e− γ r(t) ,

to be solved numerically. At the onset of the epidemic, i.e., for t → 0, the fractions of susceptible and recovered are approximately constant and equal to s(t) ≈ 1 and r(t) ≈ 0, respectively. As t → ∞, if a steady-state regime for r(t) emerges, we
expect dr(t)
dt = 0. Imposing this condition and denoting by r(∞) = limt→∞ r(t) and s(∞) = limt→∞ s(t), from the second of (9),
β

β

we have r(∞) = 1 − s(0)e− γ r(∞) ≈ 1 − e− γ r(∞) , which can be numerically solved for r(∞). An analytical solution is also
available, in terms of the so-called Lambert W function (also known as product logarithm):35


−β
W − βγ e γ + βγ
r(∞) =
.
(10)
β
γ

From the first of (9), we see that the fractions of recovered and susceptible individuals reach steady-state constant values r(∞)
(typically > 0) and s(∞) (< 1) verifying r(∞) = 1 − s(∞), while i(∞) = limt→∞ i(t) = 0. Suppose s(t) ≈ s(t ⋆ ), for some t ⋆ .
For instance, this happens at the beginning of the epidemic with s(t ⋆ ) = s(0) ≈ 1, and at the end of the epidemic, with
s(t ⋆ ) = s(∞) < 1. Thus, at different stages of the epidemic, s(t) can be approximately assumed constant over short intervals of
time. We make the assumption that variations of s(t) can indeed be neglected over short intervals of time. With s(t) = s(t ⋆ ),
from the second equation in (8), we get
di(t)
= α i(t)
dt

⇒

i(t) = i(0)e−α t ,

(11)

with α :=β s(t ⋆ ) − γ . Usually, β − γ > 0, while β s(∞) − γ < 0, so that i(t) initially grows exponentially at rate β − γ and
eventually decreases exponentially to zero at rate β s(∞) − γ .
Proposed Model

Epidemic data are typically collected on a daily basis, and a discrete version of (11) with discretization step ∆t = 1 day can
be obtained as follows. Let n be the day index. With the obvious notation in = i(n∆t) and similarly for other quantities, the
i −i
differential equation on the left-hand side of (11) is approximated by n+1∆t n = in+1 − in = α in . This yields
∆in :=in+1 − in = α in

⇒

in = i0 (1 + α )n ,

n ≥ 1,

(12)
15/20

for some i0 > 0, and therefore the ratio (also known as growth, for α > 0, or decay, for α < 0, rate)
xn :=

in
in−1

,

n ≥ 1,

(13)

is constant and equal to (1 + α ). It is useful to bear in mind that we typically have |α | ≪ 1. From (12) we see that the
sequence in grows or decays exponentially according to the sign of α , and its evolution can be locally assumed to be linear
in n because (1 + α )n ≈ 1 + n α , in view of |α | ≪ 1. For later use, note that, from the third equation in (8), we also get
∆rn :=rn+1 − rn = γ in .

(14)

It is evident that real-world data lead to “noisy” versions of the previous expressions. There exist two main sources of
uncertainty. The first is implicit in the nature of the contagion, which obviously depends on a number of medical and social
factors that are problematic to model in deterministic terms. Accordingly, the sequence {xn }n≥1 in (13) is better represented
by a collection of random variables, leading to the following model for the fraction of infected individuals on day n:
n

in = in−1 xn = i0 ∏ xk ,
k=1

n ≥ 1.

(15)

In (15), we assume that {xn }n≥1 is a sequence of nonnegative independent random variables with mean close to unity due to
the fact that |α | ≪ 1. The independence assumption is crucial to ensure mathematical tractability; however, as we show in the
section on “Performance Assessment - Synthetic Data,” slight deviations from the condition of perfect independence do not
significantly affect the performance of the proposed Mean-Agnostic Sequential Test (MAST).
The second source of uncertainty is related to the way in which the epidemic data are collected, as we describe next. First,
let us consider the values of “new positives” recorded on day n and its relationship to the “total cases” on days n and n − 1:
pn := new positivesn = total casesn - total casesn−1 .

(16)

Since the number of total cases on day n is equal to in + rn , we have pn = in + rn − (in−1 + rn−1 ) = ∆in−1 + ∆rn−1 = (α + γ )in−1 ,
because of (12) and (14). Then, we get
pn+1

(17)

yielding
n

pn+1 = pn xn = p1 ∏ xk ,
k=1

n ≥ 1,

(18)

for some initial value p1 . This is important, as while there is a natural modeling in terms of the proportion of infected
individuals in , the time-sequence {in } is difficult to obtain as the number that get removed from it (by recovery or death) is
often not reported. On the other hand, the number of newly infected pn is easily available, and reported with vigor. Based
on (18), the sequence {xn } is obtained from {pn } using the relationship xn = pn+1 /pn . Returning to the problem of the second
source of uncertainty, the sequence of daily new positives that is available from the John Hopkins University27 is expected to
differ from the actual numbers of new positives {pn }n≥1 due to gross errors, missing values or delays in the reported data. For
instance, it may happen that, on a given day, the fraction of new positives is not reported (some peripheral data collection unit
did not communicate with the central unit in a timely manner) and such unreported fraction is then added to the value observed
on a later day. Also, it typically happens that the number of reported cases over the weekend is systematically smaller than
the values recorded on other days of the week, due to the smaller number of swabs tested during weekends. Similar periodic
modulation effects are already reported in the literature.6 For these reasons, we first eliminate from the data anomalous values
(negative numbers) and then, in place of (18), we consider a more sensible observation model:
pen = pn + wn ,

n ≥ 1,

(19)

where wn is a noise term taking into account the effect of gross errors. Due to their nature, we expect that gross errors are
washed away by averaging the data over a time window of length L, where L is of the order of a week or longer. On the other
hand, we have seen that the expected behavior of pn over a sufficiently small time window is approximately linear. For this
reason, the downloaded sequence of new positives is first filtered by a moving average filter of length L days (in the paper we
use L = 21, see below). Under these assumptions, we conclude from (19) that:
h pen iL = hpn iL + hwn iL ≈ pn ,

where hpn iL = L1 ∑k pk denotes the L-th order uniformly-weighted moving average [MA(L), for short] of the sequence {pn },
where the sum involves L entries centered on the n-th sample. Admittedly, the approximation in (20) is rather sharp, but works
for our purposes. Summarizing, the sequence of daily new positives (after removing negative entries) is first processed by an
arithmetic moving average filter of order L, yielding {pn }n≥1 and then, from this, the sequence {xn = pn+1 /pn } is obtained as
in (17).
Statistical Characterization

Recall that the subscript n to xn and other quantities denotes the index of the day. The statistical distribution of the sequence
{xn } is derived from COVID-19 data made available by the Johns Hopkins University,27 as described next. For concreteness,
let us refer to the data from Italy. Figure 2(a) of the main document shows the measured sequence (not normalized to total
population) of new positives { pen } and in green the smoothed version {pn } obtained by MA(21), i.e., as the output of a moving
average filter of length L = 21 days, fed by { pen }. The corresponding sequence of ratios {xn = pn+1 /pn } is shown in Fig. 2(b)
in green. Numerical investigations, not detailed for the sake of brevity, show that the growth rate xn can be modeled by a
Gamma random variable with shape parameter κ and scale parameter θ , with κθ close to unity. Since κ is on the order of
several hundreds, the Gamma distribution is practically
indistinguishable from a Gaussian distribution with mean µ = κθ
√
on the order of unity, and standard deviation σ = κθ ≪ 1. In light of these considerations, we adopt the Gaussian model
because it leads to a detector with simple and intuitive structure.
Accordingly, let us reconsider the sequence {xn } shown in green in Figure 2(b). First, we disregard the initial portion of
the sequence {xn } that corresponds to the first peak of {pn } (first wave of the epidemic). The omitted data corresponds to
values of the day index n smaller than the index of the first passage (from the above) by one of the sequence {xn }. Then, we

again by a MA(21) filter. The length L = 21 of the two MA filters used in this analysis have been selected by trial and error.
Note that the filters are not causal:31 to compute the output at time n, (L − 1)/2 successive samples of the input are needed.
Note also that the filters are truncated at the endpoints where less than L samples are available.

probability.

results. In this respect, it should be also noted that the smoothing operation shown in Eq. (20) enforces correlation over the

Finally, in Table 1, we verify that the p-value obtained by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) goodness-of-fit test32 is larger
than 0.01, meaning that the Gaussian assumption cannot be rejected at 1% significance level, for almost all the countries
(except Spain and UK). We thus arrive at the following model of the observable growth rate sequence {xn }: xn ∼ N (µ0,n , σ )
with µ0,n ≤ 1, under the controlled regime, and xn ∼ N (µ1,n , σ ) with µ1,n > 1, under the critical one.
Performance Assessment
Real Data

The implementation of the MAST algorithm does not require knowledge of the mean sequences {µ0,n } and {µ1,n } and,
in fact, it has been designed just to cope with this uncertainty. However, the performance of the test depends, of course,
on the specific scenario under consideration. Performance of MAST run on publicly available COVID-19 infection data
from different countries is reported in the main document and obtained as follows. For each country, we investigate the
b0,n } and {µ
b1,n } of the mean sequences {µ0,n } and { µ1,n }. Since we need to
performance of MAST by using the estimates {µ
simulate arbitrarily long data streams under both the controlled and critical regimes, we construct periodic counterparts of the
b1,n }, as illustrated in Fig. 11. Using these periodic counterparts, we obtain the performance of the
b0,n } and {µ
sequences { µ
test by standard Monte Carlo computer experiments,12, 26, 34 involving 105 independent runs for each value of the threshold χ .
This gives the relationship between R and χ , and between ∆ and χ , for relatively small values of χ . The former relationship
is almost exactly exponential, and the latter almost exactly linear. Thus, the aforementioned relationships are extrapolated to
arbitrarily large values of χ . This explains why the figures of the main document report values of R that would be difficult to
obtain by standard computer experiments.
Synthetic Data

The performance of MAST is also evaluated in a synthetic scenario and compared with those of a naive Page’s test. To emulate
a realistic scenario, we assume that the mean sequence {µn } has a periodic evolution not exceeding 1 in the controlled regime,
and not falling below 1 in the critical regime. Specifically, we set

Fig. 12(a) shows the mean sequences used for this analysis, with ε = 0.1, period M = 75 days, and phases φ0 and φ1 uniformly
drawn from [0, 2π ); in addition, one realization of the resulting synthetic growth rates under H0 and under H1 is provided,
obtained by adding to each mean sequence a zero-mean Gaussian noise process with standard deviation σ = 0.050. Moreover, in order to numerically demonstrate that slight deviations from the condition of perfect independence of the sequence
{xn − µn } do not significantly affect the performance of the MAST (as claimed above), we also consider the case of a correlated zero-mean Gaussian noise process. The (normalized) correlation we enforce on the sequence {xn − µn } is shown in blue

ered in the main document. The correlated Gaussian process is generated by filtering an uncorrelated Gaussian sequence as
described in [36, Ch. 11.3.2].
MAST is compared with a naive Page’s test that is aware of the bounds of the mean sequence under each hypothesis,
namely, the lower bound 1 − ε and the upper bound 1 under H0 , and the lower bound 1 and the upper bound 1 + ε under H1 ;
naive here implies that the test does not know the exact evolution of the mean sequence, but only its extreme values. The naive
Page’s test is based on Eq. (6), reported in the main document, imposing α = ε , and corresponds to the standard Page’s test
when M = 1, φ0 = π , φ1 = 0, and the data are uncorrelated.
Fig. 13 presents the performance of MAST and the naive Page’s test in terms of risk versus mean delay for different values
of σ , obtained by standard Monte Carlo computer experiments12, 26, 34 involving 105 independent runs for each value of the
threshold χ . We observe that in the case of uncorrelated sequences, MAST outperforms the naive Page’s test, even though the
former does not have any prior information about the mean sequences, except for them being above or below 1, that is, µ0,n 6 1
and µ1,n > 1. By enforcing the correlation, the performance of both MAST and the naive Page’s test improves; however, there
are no remarkable differences, with the displacement in terms of mean delay being no more than 1 day for the MAST and 2
days for the naive Page’s test at a risk level of 10−4 .
