ABSTRACT
Objective
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global public health crisis that has been declared a pandemic by
World Health Organization. Forecasting country-wise COVID-19 cases is necessary to help policymakers
and healthcare providers prepare for the future. This study explores the performance of several Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models and Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model in
forecasting the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases.
Materials and Methods
Time series of daily cumulative COVID-19 cases were used for generating 1-day, 3-day, and 5-day forecasts
using several LSTM models and ARIMA. Two novel k-period performance metrics – k-day Mean Absolute
Percentage Error (kMAPE) and k-day Median Symmetric Accuracy (kMdSA) – were developed for
evaluating the performance of the models in forecasting time series values for multiple days.
Results
Errors in prediction using kMAPE and kMdSA for LSTM models were both as low as 0.05%, while those for
ARIMA were 0.07% and 0.06% respectively. LSTM models slightly underestimated while ARIMA slightly
overestimated the numbers in the forecasts.
Discussion
The performance of LSTM models is comparable to ARIMA in forecasting COVID-19 cases. While ARIMA
requires longer sequences, LSTMs can perform reasonably well with sequence sizes as small as 3.
However, LSTMs require a large number of training samples. Further, the development of k-period
performance metrics proposed is likely to be useful for performance evaluation of time series models in
predicting multiple periods.
Conclusion
Based on the k-period performance metrics proposed, both LSTMs and ARIMA are useful for time series
analysis and forecasting for COVID-19.

1 OBJECTIVE
The novel coronavirus (nCOV-19) and the associated disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),
presumably originated from Wuhan, China in December 20191. The rapid spread of COVID-19 worldwide
caused the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare it as a pandemic in March 20201. As of May 25,
2020, more than 1.5 million people in the United States and nearly 6 million people worldwide have been
confirmed with COVID-192. Compared to other highly-contagious previously-identified coronavirusrelated diseases, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory
Syndrome (MERS), COVID-19 appears to be more contagious according to preliminary studies3.
In light of the present circumstances, it is of paramount importance for policymakers and healthcare
professionals to plan for the future and be adequately equipped for circumstances that may arise due to
the rapid spread of COVID-19. A crucial part of planning ahead in this scenario is to forecast the number
of cases in the future, both in the short term and in the long term. While long term predictions and
forecasting can be made with epidemiological models, short term predictions can be performed by time
series analysis. In this study, we evaluate the performance of several time series analysis and forecasting
models for predicting country-wise COVID-19 cases in the short term.

2 BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE
For forecasting using time series analysis, several models, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
networks4 and Auto-regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model5, have been widely used. Some
preliminary studies for COVID-19 time series forecasting using ARIMA have also been done6,7,8. However,
two avenues of research – forecasting for multiple days in the future and the comparison of different
LSTM models with ARIMA model – are yet to be widely explored.
This study explores the performance of several LSTM models – vanilla LSTM4, stacked LSTM9, bidirectional
LSTM10, convolutional neural network LSTM (CNN LSTM)11, and ConvLSTM12 – along with ARIMA model.
Moreover, since it is worthwhile to evaluate the performance of these time series forecasting methods
for predicting multiple values in the future rather than simply single forecasts, we introduce the concept
of k-period performance metrics. These k-period performance metrics extend existing performance
metrics used for evaluating single forecasts to the general case of evaluating multiple forecasts in the
future. While the proposed concept of k-period performance metrics can be used to extend any
performance metric, we specifically choose Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)13 and Median
Symmetric Accuracy (MdSA)14 for deriving the k-period performance metrics used in this study.
The main contributions of this study are:


We evaluate and compare the performance of several LSTM architectures vis-à-vis the ARIMA model
in time series analysis and forecasting of country-wise COVID-19 cases for 4 countries.



We propose and introduce k-period performance metrics for evaluating and comparing the
performance of time series forecasting algorithms where forecasts are made for multiple time periods
in the future. While this definition can be used for any performance metric in time series forecasting,
we extend the definition of MAPE and MdSA metrics to define k-period kMAPE (kMAPE) and k-period
MdSA (kMdSA), respectively, in particular.

3 MATERIALS AND METHODS
3.1 Dataset
Time series data including the number of confirmed cases, recovered, and deaths due to COVID-19 for
several countries have been made available publicly by researchers at Johns Hopkins University2
(https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data). The dataset consists
of time series information about the total daily cumulative number of confirmed cases, recovered, and
deaths for almost all countries in the world as well as for individual US (United States of America) states.
The data is collected from different sources, such as WHO, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) in the US, and the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC) to name a few. In our
study, we have used the time series for daily cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases from 4 countries – US,
Italy, Spain, and Germany – from this dataset.
The dataset is updated daily with new information. For our experiments, we have used all data until May
25, 2020. Further, we have truncated the data in the beginning so that all time series points with number
of cases less than 100 have been removed. In other words, the first time point in our time series
corresponds to the first date when the number of confirmed cases in that particular country was 100 or
above. This step has been done to ensure that the noise incorporated in the time series data due to lack
of testing in several countries in the initial stages of the disease does not affect the time series data in
general.

3.2 Time series analysis and forecasting
In this study, we have used several LSTM architectures and ARIMA model for the forecasting of confirmed
COVID-19 cases in different countries. These models are briefly described here.

3.2.1 LSTM Models
Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks4 are recurrent neural networks (RNN) widely used in deep
learning. LSTMs were designed to process sequences of data and improved upon traditional RNN by using
memory cells that can store information in memory for long sequences, and a set of gates to control the
flow of this memory information. These innovations allow LSTM to learn longer term dependencies in
sequential data.
The following LSTM architectures were used in our experiments:




Vanilla LSTM: A vanilla LSTM is the simplest LSTM model with a single LSTM unit having multiple
neurons. In our experiments, the vanilla LSTM had 𝑛𝑛 = 100 neurons.
Stacked LSTM: A stacked LSTM9 utilizes a stacked architecture of two or more vanilla LSTMs. In
our experiments, two vanilla LSTMs with 𝑛𝑛 = 50 were stacked together.
Bidirectional LSTM: A bidirectional LSTM10 architecture splits the neurons of a regular LSTM into
two directions – positive time direction for forward states and negative time direction for
backward states. As a result, input information from both the past and the future of the current
time point is used. In our experiments, bidirectional LSTMs with 𝑛𝑛 = 50 neurons were used.





CNN LSTM: Also known as Long-term Recurrent Convolutional Network (LRCN), CNN LSTM11
architecture incorporates 1-D spatial structure along with temporal structure to learn patterns.
Here, 1-D spatial structures are created by grouping together a few time points and considering
them as 1-D spatial structures. This unique architecture allows the network to identify patterns in
small groups of time points along with the actual temporal patterns in the time series. In our
experiments, the CNN LSTM consisted of 𝑛𝑛 = 50 neurons in the LSTM and 𝑛𝑓 = 64
convolutional filters along with a max pooling layer in the CNN.
ConvLSTM: ConvLSTM12 (Convolutional LSTM) architecture allows convolutions at the gates of the
LSTM to capture spatio-temporal patterns. Although it learns spatio-temporal patterns similar to
CNN LSTM, the manner in which it does so is different (by using convolutions at the gates). In our
experiments, the ConvLSTM used 𝑛𝑛 = 50 neurons and 𝑛𝑓 = 64 convolutional filters.

LSTMs are notoriously sensitive to initialization. To tackle the initialization problem, the models were
trained on 100 different random initializations and the one with the best (least) validation kMAPE (k-day
Mean Absolute Percentage Error) was selected for obtaining the performance on the test set. The data
were divided into training, validation, and test sets of size 𝑛𝑑 − 20, 10, and 10 respectively (where 𝑛𝑑 is
the number of time series sequences obtained from the data).
Further, we trained the LSTMs on varying sizes of input sequences. We used sequence sizes of 𝑛𝑠 =
3, 6, 10, 15 in our experiments. Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.1 was used for training the LSTM
models and mean squared error was used as the loss function.

3.2.2 ARIMA Model
The Auto-regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model is a time series analysis and forecasting
method. The ARIMA model has three components:




Autoregression (AR): An Autoregressive model derives the regression relationship between a
changing variable based on its own prior (or lagged) values.
Integrated (I): Integration refers to modeling the differences between raw observations so that
the time series can be considered stationary. In other words, raw values are replaced by the
differences between the raw values and the previous values.
Moving Average (MA): The moving average component in the model incorporates the relationship
between an observation and a residual error from a moving average model applied to prior (or
lagged) observations.

An ARIMA model has three parameters:
1. 𝑝, the number of lag observations in the model (or the lag order)
2. 𝑑, the number of times the raw observations are differenced (or the degree of differencing)
3. 𝑞, the size of the window for moving average (or the order of moving average)
In our experiments, these parameters were empirically chosen to be the following values: 𝑝 = 1, 𝑑 =
2, 𝑞 = 2. Values of the parameters were evaluated using a grid search on each parameter between values
1 and 3, and subsequently chosen empirically to reflect the best performance of the ARIMA model. For all
experiments with the ARIMA model, the sequence length was kept as 𝑛𝑠 = 15.
3.2.3 k-period Forecasts
Besides the commonly-used 1-day forecast into the future, we also performed experiments for predicting
the time series values for 𝑘 periods (i.e., 𝑘 days in this case) in the future. We used 𝑘 = 1, 3, 5 in our

experiments. For both the LSTM models and the ARIMA model, the prediction of the 1st day in the future
was added to the input sequence for predicting the 2nd day and so on. In general, if the input sequence
is [𝑥1 , 𝑥2 , … , 𝑥𝑛𝑠 −1 , 𝑥𝑛𝑠 ], where the size of the sequence is 𝑛𝑠 , the forecast for the next day is 𝑥̂𝑛𝑠 +1 . For
predicting the subsequent day, the input sequence is modified to [𝑥2 , 𝑥3 , … , 𝑥𝑛𝑠 −1 , 𝑥𝑛𝑠 , 𝑥̂𝑛𝑠 +1 ] and the
forecast for the 2nd day in the future is 𝑥̂𝑛𝑠 +2 . In this way, forecasting for 𝑘 = 𝑛𝑝 days in the future gives
us the k-day predictions as [𝑥̂𝑛𝑠+1 , 𝑥̂𝑛𝑠 +2 , … , 𝑥̂𝑛𝑠 +𝑛𝑝 ].

3.3 Performance Metrics
For evaluating the performance for time series forecasting models, several performance metrics are
commonly used15. In this study, we have chosen the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Median
Symmetric Accuracy (MdSA)14, both of which are measures of error in prediction and expressed as a
percentage. MAPE is given by,
𝑛

100
|𝑥̂𝑖 − 𝑥𝑖 |
𝑀𝐴𝑃𝐸 =
%
∑
𝑛
|𝑥𝑖 |

(1)

𝑖=1

where 𝑥𝑖 denotes the true value at time point 𝑖, 𝑥̂𝑖 denotes the predicted value at time point 𝑖, and 𝑛
denotes the number of 1-day predictions made.
MdSA is based on the log accuracy ratio and is given by,
𝑛
𝑀𝑑𝑆𝐴 = 100 × {exp (𝑀𝑑𝑗=1
(|ln

𝑥̂𝑗
|)) − 1} %
𝑥𝑗

(2)

𝑛
where 𝑀𝑑𝑗=1
(𝑎𝑗 ) denotes the median of the numbers 𝑎𝑗 , 𝑗 = 1, 2, … , 𝑛. MdSA possesses several
symmetry and robustness properties14, thus making it a good choice as a metric in our study. Further, the
use of the median operation instead of the most commonly-used mean operation renders this metric
immune to the effect of outliers, making it more robust compared to MAPE and other similar metrics.

3.3.1 k-period Performance Metrics
Both the described metrics are designed for evaluating multiple 1-period forecasts. In our study, we also
seek to predict and evaluate multiple k-period forecasts. Towards this goal, we extend the definition of
any performance evaluation metric to incorporate the evaluation of k-period forecasts. Consider 𝑃
𝑝 𝑝
𝑝
sequences [𝑥1 , 𝑥2 , … , 𝑥𝑛𝑠 ], 𝑝 = 1, 2, … , 𝑃, each of length 𝑛𝑠 . For each of these sequences, we can obtain
𝑝

𝑝

𝑝

k-period predictions as described before. These predictions are given by [𝑥̂𝑛𝑠+1 , 𝑥̂𝑛𝑠 +2 , … , 𝑥̂𝑛𝑠 +𝑘 ], 𝑝 =
1, 2, … , 𝑃, each of length 𝑘.
We define the general k-period metric as,
𝑘

1
k-period 𝑀𝑒𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑐 = ∑ 𝑀𝑒𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑐([𝑥𝑛1𝑠 +𝑖 , 𝑥𝑛2𝑠 +𝑖 , … , 𝑥𝑛𝑃𝑠 +𝑖 ], [𝑥̂𝑛1𝑠 +𝑖 , 𝑥̂𝑛2𝑠 +𝑖 , … , 𝑥̂𝑛𝑃𝑠 +𝑖 ])
𝑘
𝑖=1

(3)

where 𝑀𝑒𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑐([𝑥𝑛1𝑠 +𝑖 , 𝑥𝑛2𝑠+𝑖 , … , 𝑥𝑛𝑃𝑠+𝑖 ], [𝑥̂𝑛1𝑠 +𝑖 , 𝑥̂𝑛2𝑠+𝑖 , … , 𝑥̂𝑛𝑃𝑠+𝑖 ]) is any metric which measures the
performance of a time series forecast model between the true values ([𝑥𝑛1𝑠+𝑖 , 𝑥𝑛2𝑠 +𝑖 , … , 𝑥𝑛𝑃𝑠 +𝑖 ]) and the
predicted values ([𝑥̂𝑛1𝑠 +𝑖 , 𝑥̂𝑛2𝑠 +𝑖 , … , 𝑥̂𝑛𝑃𝑠 +𝑖 ]). In essence, it is the mean of the performance of prediction over
𝑘 days.
Specifically, we define the k-period MAPE (kMAPE) as,
𝑘

𝑃

𝑖=1

𝑝=1

𝑝

𝑝

𝑥̂𝑛 +𝑖 − 𝑥𝑛𝑠 +𝑖

(4)

𝑝

where 𝑥𝑛𝑠+𝑖 , 𝑖 = 1, 2, … , 𝑘 are true values for 𝑘 days in the future and 𝑥̂𝑛𝑠 +𝑖 , 𝑖 = 1, 2, … , 𝑘 are the
predicted values for 𝑘 days in the future for the 𝑝th input sequence.
Similarly, k-period MdSA (kMdSA) is given by,
𝑘

𝑝

𝑥̂𝑛 +𝑖

𝑃
𝑘𝑀𝑑𝑆𝐴 = ∑ {100 × [exp (𝑀𝑑𝑝=1
(|ln 𝑝𝑠 |)) − 1]}
𝑘

(5)

𝑖=1

where the notations are the same as in Eqn. 2 and Eqn. 4.
It is to be noted that in the case of 1-day forecast in the future, the k-day performance metrics are identical
to the original definition of the performance metrics. Figure 1 shows how performance metrics are
calculated and how they can be extended to define the k-period performance metrics.

4 RESULTS
The performance of the different LSTM models and ARIMA models were compared using kMAPE and
kMdSA as described. For LSTM models, input sequence length 𝑛𝑠 = 3, 6, 10, 15 were used in our
experiments while for the ARIMA model, only 𝑛𝑠 = 15 was used.
Table 1 shows the performance of the LSTM models, viz., vanilla LSTM, stacked LSTM, bidirectional LSTM,
CNN LSTM, and ConvLSTM, using 𝑛𝑠 = 3 vis-à-vis the ARIMA model with 𝑛𝑠 = 15, compared using the
kMAPE metric.

5 DISCUSSION
Short- and long-term forecasts and predictions of the number of cases in any epidemic or pandemic can
be a useful tool for several government agencies and policymakers in different countries to prepare for
the progression and spread of a disease. Given the rapid growth of COVID-19 cases worldwide, it is
imperative that these tools be widely available to relevant agencies and personnel to aid in preparation
(e.g. number of hospital beds and ventilators, requirement and availability of healthcare workers, and the
demand for personal protective equipment (PPE)) which would be directly reflected in better outcomes
for patients as well as the number of lives saved due to a deadly or fatal disease.
In this work, we have compared the ARIMA model with variants of a supervised model (LSTM) for
forecasting country-wise COVID-19 cases for 4 different countries – United States of America, Italy, Spain,
and Germany. Similar analyses can be performed with the data from any country and even at more
granular levels, such as states, counties, cities, and districts to obtain an insight into the preparation
required to combat the spread of the disease.
Our results indicate ARIMA performs reasonably well and is often superior to the variants of the
supervised LSTM models used in this study. This makes the ARIMA model suitable for baseline
performance comparisons and can be used for developing better models for time series analysis and
forecasting.
As expected, the performance of all the models deteriorates slightly as the number of forecast periods
(i.e., days in our case) in the future is increased. This drop in performance is attributed to the fact that the
prediction for the 2nd day uses the prediction for the 1st day in its input sequence, and so on. As a result,
the errors in prediction are propagated as the forecasts are made for more and more days into the future.
This is the reason why time series forecasting models presented in this study are unsuitable for long-term
forecasting.
It is also interesting to note that the performance of the vanilla LSTM is comparable and often better than
the performance of the more complex LSTM models discussed here. This pattern indicates that more
complex models are likely not necessary for this forecasting problem.
Since we have used only data starting with the day when 100 cases were reported for a country, the
number of training sequences for each country has been different. Given the nature of deep learning
models such as LSTM, improvements in performance often correlate with greater number of training data.
As a result, it can be seen how the forecast performance of the LSTM models for US, Italy, and Germany
are better than those for Spain since the number of training samples for Spain were fewer compared to
the other countries. It is expected that the performance of all the LSTM models would improve over time
as more and more data becomes available for all countries worldwide, thus making more training data
available. The ARIMA model is, however, immune to these problems.
In light of the training set size, the choice of models for forecasting becomes obvious. If there are only a
small number of training samples available, the ARIMA model can be chosen for forecasting. However,
once more and more data is available for training the LSTM models, the best among these models can
be chosen if its performance supersedes that of the ARIMA model.
On the other hand, whereas LSTM models in our experiment were fairly stable even for very short input
sequences of length, 𝑛𝑠 = 3 and 𝑛𝑠 = 6, the sequence length for the ARIMA model is kept at 𝑛𝑠 = 15,

since a short sequence length is deemed to be insufficient for exploring the correlation in the sequence
by ARIMA. This makes LSTM models more attractive if we are dealing with sequences of shorter length.
From Figure 2, it is also apparent that ARIMA models slightly overestimate the numbers while LSTM
models are more likely to underestimate in their forecasts when compared to the actual ground truth
data.
There are some limitations to this work. Out of several possible LSTM models, only five were evaluated in
this study. Moreover, there is a plethora of time series analysis and forecasting algorithms that can be
evaluated for this particular problem. The time series analysis and forecasting presented in this study are
restricted to short term forecasts only. Forecasting over longer terms would require more parameters to
be considered in the modeling that is beyond the scope of this work.
The data that has been made available by the public agencies of different countries might be prone to
errors and the limited testing capabilities for COVID-19 in certain countries are likely to affect the results
of the algorithms, thus yielding lower estimates. Moreover, the availability of testing and rate of infection
within a country might vary between different demographics due to economic conditions, the cost of
testing, and the availability of insurance among the different demographics16. The present study also does
not model the changes in the public health policy of different countries which would possibly affect the
future estimates for the numbers of patients suffering from COVID-19. However, it might be noted that
these changes in public health policy would most likely affect long term forecasts rather than short term
trends.

6 CONCLUSION
COVID-19 is a global public health crisis. Forecasts and predictions of cases for the future are essential for
government agencies and policymakers to combat the situation by planning for the needs of healthcare
personnel and the availability of healthcare equipment and PPEs. In this study, we have presented the
time series analysis and forecasting of the number of COVID-19 cases in 4 countries – United States, Italy,
Spain, and Germany – using the ARIMA model and several LSTM architectures. We have also proposed
the concept of k-period performance metrics designed to evaluate the performance of a time series
analysis model that forecasts for multiple periods in the future. In particular, we have extended the
definition of MAPE and MdSA to define k-period MAPE (kMAPE) and k-period MdSA (kMdSA). Our results
indicate that LSTM models perform comparably with the ARIMA model. However, both models have their
advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of models is dictated by the availability of training samples
as well as the sequence length. Further research would include the development and evaluation of other
time series forecasting models as well as the evaluation of these models as more data becomes available.
