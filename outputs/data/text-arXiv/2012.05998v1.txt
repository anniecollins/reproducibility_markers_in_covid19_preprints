Lifting Lockdown Control Measure Assessment:
From Finite to Infinite-dimensional Epidemic
Models for COVID-19*
Redouane Qesmi and Aayah Hammoumi

Abstract The main focus of this chapter is on public health control strategies which
are currently the main way to mitigate COVID-19 pandemic. We introduce and compare compartmental models of increasing complexity for COVID-19 transmission to
describe dynamics of the disease spread. We begin by considering an SEAIR model
including basic characteristics related to COVID-19. Next, we shall pay attention to
age-structure modeling to emphasis the role of age-group individuals on the disease
spread. A Model with constant delay is also formulated to show the impact of the
latency period on the severity of COVID-19. Since there is evidence that for COVID19 disease, important relationships exist between what is happening in the host and
what is occurring at the population level, we shall link the basic model to in-host
dynamics through the so-called threshold-type delay models. Finally, we will include demographic eﬀects to the most complex models and we will conduct rigorous
bifurcation analysis to quantify possible factors responsible for disease progression.

1.1 Introduction
The SARS-CoV-2, designated as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus2, is a causative agent of COVID-19 disease that ﬁrst emerged in China on December
2019 [28]. Up to date, 213 countries and territories are aﬀected by the disease, with

nearly 19 million conﬁrmed cases and more than 700,000 deaths. Unfortunately,
there are no current eﬀective therapeutic agents or vaccines for treatment of COVID19 and, consequently, public health control strategies that diminish contact between
infectious and susceptible individuals are actually the main way to contain and mitigate the pandemic [36]. Examples of such a control include the personal protective
measures (e.g. hand hygiene, cough or sneeze etiquette and face coverings), social
distancing measures (e.g increasing physical distance from other people, avoiding
social gathering and stay at home) and environmental surface cleaning [12]. However, despite health control interventions seem to be successful in reducing the spread
of the pandemic, they are also responsible of global economic crisis. It is estimated
that COVID-19 could cost the global economy more than $10 trillion [1, 21]. Millions of individuals throughout the world have been forced to reduce their working
hours or have lost their jobs and around 900 million students are aﬀected by national
school closures [30, 33]. Furthermore, because of the isolation and the increase of
social class inequalities, the lockdown is badly lived by the majority of children and
adults who have developed mental health disorders and familial problems [1, 8, 21].
Although many information related to COVID-19, such as its potential to reoccur,
remain unclear, lifting lockdown measure became an urgent need to avoid the worsening of the global crisis caused by COVID-19 [22]. Governments around the world
encountered serious diﬃculties to adopt the best lockdown lifting strategy balancing
between economy recovery and health protection of citizens.
Fortunately, since the beginning of the outbreak of COVID-19, mathematical
modeling proved to be an eﬀective tool to predict the course as well as the severity
of the epidemic and to help decision makers to evaluate the eﬀectiveness of health
control measures (See [4, 13, 15, 20, 32] and references therein). Generally, at the
beginning of an emergent epidemic, the novel pathogenic agent lacks detailed knowledge. Mathematicians begin by using simplest compartmental models to estimate
the key epidemiological parameters (such as the basic reproduction number 𝑅0 , peak
time, peak size, latency period, infectious period, etc) which are necessary to set up
public health strategies and monitor the disease progression [3]. Most such models
consider individuals in a closed population that are classiﬁed according to their
disease status: susceptible (S), latent or Exposed (E), infectious (I) and recovered
(R). These basic models have the great advantage of being easy to investigate but,
on the other hand, often oversimplify the existing complexity of disease processes
which underestimate or overestimate the magnitude of the disease spread. However, more complex models can be considered in case the scientists provide more
epidemiological evidences leading to detailed knowledge of Sars-Cov-2 pathogenic
mechanism and its mode of transmission. Even if they are more diﬃcult to analyze
and need more detailed data, these models could be more realistic since they take
into account more realistic epidemiological properties such as the heterogeneity of
disease transmission, age-subgroups, latent periods and so on. The purpose of this
chapter is to consider and compare diﬀerent deterministic compartmental models of
increasing complexity that will be useful to clarify how Sars-CoV-2 spread within
individuals while considering the relaxation of the compulsory lockdown to prevent
dissemination of the COVID-19 disease.

The main contribution of this chapter is organized as follows. In Section 1.3,
we will consider and investigate an extended basic SEAIR model which is widely
used for COVID-19 disease. Indeed, this model takes into account the standard
epidemiological states such as the exposed individuals to the Sars-CoV-2 virus
which are infected but can not transmit the virus to others. In Section 1.4, we
consider an extension of the previous model with particular focus on an identiﬁed
route of COVID-19 transmission from children to adults and vice versa. In other
words, we present a discrete age-structured model, by separating the population into
two diﬀerent age-subgroups with diﬀerent contact rates, to look at the heterogeneity
of COVID-19 transmission within a population. Indeed, it is proved that children are
less aﬀected by Sars-Cov-2 than adults and play a minor role in disease transmission
[2, 17]. Seniors and person with existing chronic medical conditions develop more
severe form of disease and are more likely to die [34]. Furthermore, individuals with
diﬀerent ages may also have diﬀerent behaviors and behavioral changes which are
crucial in the assessment of control scenarios targeted at particular groups, such as
reopening schools or relaunch of economic activities. The impact of the latent period
on disease transmission is also evaluated in Section 1.5 by incorporating a time delay
to the basic SAIR model instead of considering the latent stage as a model component.
In Section 1.6, we examine a threshold-type delay model by incorporating a series
of smaller Sars-CoV-2 viral loads, due to close contact with infectious individuals,
into the within-host virus dynamics. This type of model can be used for example
to study the impact of COVID-19 exposure to health care workers who are daily in
close contacts with COVID-19 patients, visitors or co-workers in a population and
are more likely to be infected [7]. In Section 1.7, we include vital dynamics to the
constant and threshold-type delay models by assuming that the COVID-19 disease
could persist for a long period. Indeed, with the evidence of sensibility of SarsCoV-2 to climatic factors such as temperature and humidity, scientists think that the
COVID-19 allows a seasonal cycle and could reduce with climate change. But, even
with the arrival of the warm weather, the disease still evolved and could persist for
several months or years. This demonstrates that the climate change is not the main
parameter which inﬂuences the disease transmission but also, the people’s behavior,
the low immunity of individuals to a novel coronavirus and the immunity period
(the amount of time that people remain immune after infection) [9, 11]. We will
then conduct rigorous qualitative analysis including bifurcation investigation of both
models with demographic eﬀect to quantify possible factors responsible for disease
progression and highlight long term qualitative behavior of COVID-19 spread. Next,
in order to help scientists to avoid major blunders and generate models that ﬁt the data
reasonably accurately, we compare in Section 1.8 the proposed models to identify
which one best ﬁts the reported data and provide a better prediction for COVID-19.
Results of our models will help to tackle health concerns that are of great importance
and will draw of the hospitals research and surveillance data to create, optimize, and
parameterize disease models, focusing on COVID-19.

1.2 Data Collection
The data of reported symptomatic infectious cases is collected each day at 11 pm
from the oﬃcial Coronavirus Portal of Morocco [27]. Data information covers the
cumulative number of reported cases from March 2𝑛𝑑 to June 10𝑡ℎ, 2020. The data
from March 2𝑛𝑑 to March 20 (ﬁrst day of lockdown measure) are used to estimate
the basic reproduction number and adjust the investigated models to become closer
to reality, while data from March 21𝑠𝑡 to June 10𝑡ℎ (last day of lockdown measure)
are used to adjust the models and estimate the lockdown rate during this period of
lockdown.

1.3 Basic COVID-19 Model
The population, with size 𝑁, considered in this basic model is stratiﬁed into seven
disease status. Individuals are classiﬁed as susceptible (𝑆), exposed noninfectious
(𝐸) , asymptomatic infectious ( 𝐴), unreported symptomatic infectious (𝐼𝑢 ), reported symptomatic infectious or hospitalized (𝐻), recovered (𝑅) and dead (𝐷).
We formulate the model to describe the course of COVID-19 epidemic under the
assumptions:
1. Reported symptomatic infectious individuals are hospitalized and can not contact
susceptibles anymore.
2. As conﬁrmed by Rothe et al. [24], asymptomatic individuals can infect susceptible
individuals.
3. Conﬁned asymptomatic and conﬁned unreported individuals can still spread the
virus to their families.
4. Exposed infected individuals can not immediately spread the virus to other individuals.
5. As proved by MacIntyre in [18], asymptomatic and symptomatic infectious individuals share the same infection probability.
Taking account of the previous assumptions, the dynamics of COVID-19 can be
described as follows: Individuals are conﬁned at rate 𝑝. Unconﬁned (resp. conﬁned)
susceptibles (1−𝑝)𝑆 (resp. ( 𝑝𝑆) ) contacted with either unreported symptomatic (𝐼𝑢)
or asymptomatic infectious individuals ( 𝐴) are infected with infection probability,
𝛽 𝑁 (resp. 𝛽𝑐 ), and move to the exposed infected class (𝐸). Exposed individuals
then become asymptomatic infectious at rate 𝑘. After an average period 1/𝛿 days the
asymptomatic infectious individuals ( 𝐴) become symptomatic and proceed either to
the unreported symptomatic infectious (𝐼𝑢), at rate 𝛿1 , or to the reported symptomatic
infectious (𝐻) at rate 𝛿2 with 𝛿 = 𝛿1 + 𝛿2 . Once becoming symptomatic, individuals
of class 𝐼𝑢 and 𝐻 remain symptomatic for 1/𝜇 days on average before they are
recovered or dead at rate 𝑑. The parameter 𝛾 corresponds to the lifting rate while
parameter 𝜃 corresponds to the contact reduction, due to wearing masks, washing
hands, and social distancing practices of unconﬁned individuals. The general basic

1.3.1 Reproduction Numbers
The basic reproduction number, 𝑅0 , is the average number of secondary infections
produced when one infectious individual is introduced into a host susceptible population. This quantity determines whether a given disease may spread, or die out in
a population. To compute this number, we assume that 𝑝 = 𝜃 = 𝛾 = 0 and we apply
the next generation matrix method in [31]. We obtain

where 𝑎 is an estimated constant given in Subsection 1.3.2. Here, 𝑅0 can be explained
as follows: Assume that one asymptomatic infectious individual is introduced into the
1
susceptible population. This asymptomatic individual produces, on average, 𝛽 𝑁 𝑆0
𝛿
asymptomatic individuals during his average lifespan 1/𝛿. These asymptomatic
individuals then become unreported symptomatic infectious individuals over their
lifespan 1/𝛿 at a rate 𝛿1 and then each infectious symptomatic produces, on average,
1
𝛽 𝑁 𝑆0 asymptomatic individuals during his lifespan 1/𝜇.

Let us show the formula of 𝑅0 . The linearized system related to infectious individuals , around (𝑆0 , 0, 0, 0) , of system (1.1) is given by

The control reproduction number, 𝑅𝑐 , is an important value, used to determine

be eﬃcient to decrease the number of secondary infections to be less than one.

1.3.2 Parameter and Initial Data Estimation
To estimate the model parameters we will consider two diﬀerent stages. The ﬁrst
stage is between the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic and the ﬁrst time of
containment control (i.e 𝑝 = 0 and 𝜃 = 0) for which we will estimate the initial data
of the model, the parameters related to infection and the basic reproduction number.
The second stage will be during the lockdown period (𝛾 = 0 and 𝜃 = 0) for which
we will estimate the lockdown rate.
Since the ﬁrst and the only symptomatic infectious individual is reported on March
2𝑛𝑑, 2020, which corresponds to 𝑡 = 0, then 𝐻 (0) = 1, 𝑅(0) = 0 and 𝐷 (0) = 0.
For the estimation of 𝛽 𝑁 , 𝐸 (0), 𝐴(0) and 𝐼𝑢 (0) we will use the data of cumulative
reported cases collected from March 2nd to March 20 (before the start of lockdown)
and we follow the procedure by [15]. ∫The cumulative reported infectious population
𝑡
is given, for 𝑡 ≥ 0, by 𝐹 (𝑡) = 𝛿2 0 𝐴(𝑠)𝑑𝑠 + 1. It is obvious that cumulative
reported infectious population increases slowly and then accelerates rapidly with
time. Hence, we will use exponential regression with 95% of conﬁdence level to ﬁnd
an exponential function that best ﬁts the data, from March 2𝑛𝑑 to June 10𝑡ℎ. Using
SPSS software (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) we found that exponential
model given by 𝑏𝑒 𝑎𝑡 with 𝑎 = 0.263 with conﬁdence interval 𝐶𝐼 (0.229 − 0.297) and

𝑏 = 0.507 with 𝐶𝐼 (0.3444 − 0.7475) ﬁts well∫the data with a correlation coeﬃcient
𝑡
given by 𝑅 = 0.97. It follows from 𝐹 (𝑡) = 𝛿2 0 𝐴(𝑠)𝑑𝑠 + 1 = 𝑏𝑒 𝑎𝑡 that
𝐴(𝑡) =

(1.3)

Since the initial susceptible population is not dramatically aﬀected in the early phase
of the epidemic, we will assume that 𝑆(𝑡) ≈ 𝑆(0). Let 𝑆0 := 𝑆(0), 𝐸 (0) := 𝐸 0 ,
𝐴(0) := 𝐴0 and 𝐼𝑢 (0) := 𝐼0 . From the second and the third equations of system (1.1)
and using (1.3) we obtain

Now, using formulas (1.5) and the third equation of system (1.1), we obtain after

𝑎𝐸 0 = 𝛽 𝑁 𝑆0 ( 𝐴0 + 𝐼0 ) − 𝑘𝐸 0
(1.7)
and
𝑎𝐼0 = 𝛿1 𝐴0 − (𝜇 + 𝑑)𝐼0 .

(1.8)

Solving equations (1.6), (1.7) and (1.8) for 𝛽 𝑁 and 𝐼0 lead to
𝛽𝑁 =

and 𝐼0 =

To estimate the transmission rate, 𝛽𝑐 , and the lockdown rate, 𝑝 during the lockdown
period, we assume that 𝛾 = 0 and 𝜃 = 0 and we use the nonlinear least squares solver
“lsqcurveﬁt” in MATLAB R2019b software. The values of the estimated parameters
are summarized in Table 1.1.

where Newcase(𝑖) is the number of new reported cases on the day 𝑖 and 𝑛 is the
number of collected new cases. This number measures the discrepancy between the
data and the estimation model of new reported cases per day and will serve us to
compare the suggested models of this chapter. A small 𝑆𝑆𝑅 indicates a better ﬁt
of the model to the data. A computation of this measure for model (1.1) leads to

1.4 Discrete Age Structure COVID-19 Model
Basic discrete age-structured compartmental models seems to be more appropriate
for COVID-19 disease since it is claimed that adults have a greater risk of transmitting
SARS-CoV-2 virus than children do toward susceptibles (See Section 1.1). This
suggest that in order to give more appropriate description of COVID-19 transmission
it is important to separate the population into two diﬀerent age-subgroups.
The population considered in this section is stratiﬁed into two age categories
and ten disease status. Individuals are classiﬁed as susceptible children (𝑇), susceptible adult (𝑆), exposed noninfectious (𝐸𝑇 ) , exposed noninfectious adult (𝐸 𝑠 ) ,
asymptomatic infectious adult ( 𝐴), asymptomatic infectious children (𝐵), unreported symptomatic infectious (𝐼𝑢 ), hospitalized symptomatic infectious (𝐻), recovered individuals (𝑅) and dead individuals (𝐷). We assume that infected children
do not show symptoms and can still transmit the disease. COVID-19 disease dynamics can be described as follows: Let 𝛽 𝜒 be the transmission rate from infectious
individuals to conﬁned susceptible individuals and 𝛽 𝑁 be the transmission rate from
infectious individuals to unconﬁned susceptible individuals. Then, for 𝑖 ∈ { 𝜒, 𝑁 } ,
susceptibles adults (𝑆) (resp. susceptible children (𝑇)) are infected through contact
with infectious adults ( 𝐴 + 𝐼𝑢 ) at a transmission rate 𝛽𝑖𝑎𝑎 (resp. 𝛽𝑖𝑐𝑎 ) or through contact with infectious children (𝐵) at a transmission rate 𝛽𝑖𝑎𝑐 (resp. 𝛽𝑖𝑐𝑐 ) and move to

the exposed noninfectious adult class (𝐸 𝑠 ) (resp. the exposed noninfectious children
class (𝐸𝑇 ) ). Adult exposed individuals (resp. children exposed individuals) then
become asymptomatic infectious at rate 𝑘 𝑠 (resp. 𝑘 𝑇 ). After an average period 1/𝛿
days the asymptomatic infectious individuals ( 𝐴) become symptomatic and proceed
either to the unreported symptomatic infectious (𝐼𝑢 ), at rate 𝛿1 , or to the hospitalized
individual (𝐻) at rate 𝛿2 with 𝛿 = 𝛿1 + 𝛿2 . Once becoming symptomatic, individuals
of class 𝐼𝑢 and 𝐻 either remain asymptomatic for 1/𝜇 days on average before they
are recovered or remain asymptomatic for 1/𝑑 days on average before they are dead.
Asymptomatic children can either be recovered without being hospitalized at rate
𝛿 or detected and hospitalized at rate 𝜎. The control parameters are as deﬁned in
Section 1.3. The subscripts 𝑐 and 𝑎, respectively, characterize children and adults.

1.4.2 Parameter and Initial Data Estimation
Note that the ﬁrst infected child was reported 22 days since the beginning of the
epidemic. Furthermore, the maximum asymptomatic duration including the exposure
period is about 14 days. Consequently, there were neither exposed nor asymptomatic
infected children under 15 years old at 𝑡 = 0. Thus, the initial data values related
to infected adult individuals are the same as those in system 1.3. Furthermore,
𝐸 0 = 𝐵0 = 0, 𝑇0 = 9683602 and 𝑆0 = 26181589. As mentioned in Section 1.1, we
assume that 𝛽𝑖𝑎𝑐 = 𝛽𝑖𝑎𝑎 , 𝛽𝑖𝑐𝑎 = 𝛽𝑖𝑐𝑐 where 𝑖 ∈ { 𝜒, 𝑁 } . Using the same ﬁtting solver
as in Section 1.3.2, we obtain the parameter values shown in Table 1.2. The 𝑆𝑆𝑅
related to this model is estimated to be 𝑆𝑆𝑅 𝑎𝑔𝑒 = 98.76.

1.5 COVID-19 Model with Constant Delay
In order to enable the study of the eﬀect of the period time, in which infected individuals are asymptomatic and noninfectious, on the COVID-19 dynamics, we will
incorporate the time delay (latency period) in the basic model instead of considering
the noninfectious latent state as a model component. Let 𝜂 denotes the death rate
of noninfectious exposed individuals. Once infected through contact with infectious
individuals at rate 𝛽, the susceptible individuals that survive with probability 𝑒 −𝜂 𝜏
become infectious (able to transmit the infection) when the time since exposure
exceeds an exposure period time 𝜏. The dynamics of the model are described by the
following system of diﬀerential equation with delay

where 𝛼 = (1 − 𝛾) 𝑝 𝛽𝑐 + (1 − 𝜃) (1 − (1 − 𝛾) 𝑝) 𝛽 𝑁 and all the model parameters,
except 𝜂 and 𝜏, are described similarly to those in Section 1.3.

To compute the Basic reproduction number, we apply the survival function approach
described by Heﬀernan, Smith, and Wahl [6]. Let 𝑅01 (respectively, 𝑅02 ) be the
average number of secondary infections produced when one asymptomatic infected
(respectively, symptomatic unreported infected) individual is ∫introduced into the host
∞
virgin population. Following the work in [6], we have 𝑅01 = 0 𝐹 (𝑠)𝑑𝑠 where 𝐹 (𝑠)
is the probability that a newly asymptomatic infected individual has been produced
by an existing asymptomatic infectious individual and lives
∫ for at least time 𝑠. The
𝑠

probability function 𝐹 (𝑠) can be expressed as 𝐹 (𝑠) =

𝑃1 (𝑡)𝑃2 (𝑠, 𝑡)𝑑𝑡, where

𝑃1 (𝑡) is the probability that an asymptomatic infected individual of age 𝑡 infects

be reduced to 𝑅01 = 𝛽𝑁 𝑆𝑁0 𝑒𝛿 .Since asymptomatic individuals can become unreported symptomatic infectious individuals over their lifespan 1/𝛿 at a rate 𝛿1 and

as 𝑅02 = 𝛽𝑁 𝑆𝑁

Similarly, we can obtain the control reproduction number for system (1.13).

1.5.2 Parameter and Initial Data Estimation
Since the parameters 𝛿, 𝛿1 ,𝛿2 , 𝜇 and 𝑑 are not aﬀected by the age then their values
are the same as those in Subsection 1.3.2. Note that since there were no death of
exposed individuals then it is meaningful to assume that 𝜂 = 0. To estimate the initial
data we will use the same process as in Subsection 1.3.2 so that 𝐴(𝑡) will be given
by (1.3) for 𝑡 close to 0. Thus, using the second and the third equations of system
(1.13) we obtain, for 𝑡 close to 0,
𝑎 𝐴(𝑡) = 𝛽 𝑁 𝑆(0) ( 𝐴(𝑡 − 𝜏) + 𝐼𝑢 (𝑡 − 𝜏)) /𝑁 − 𝛿 𝐴(𝑡),

(1.14)

𝐼𝑢 (𝑡 + 𝜃) = 𝐼0 (𝜃) 𝑒 𝑎𝑡 ,

(1.15)

and

where
𝐼0 (𝜃) =

𝛿1
𝑏𝑎 𝑎 𝜃
𝑒 .
𝑎 + 𝜇 + 𝑑 𝛿2

(1.16)

Now, using equations (1.14) and (1.15) and the third equation of system (1.13), we
obtain after simpliﬁcation

𝐴0 𝑒 −𝑎 𝜏 /𝑁 − 𝛿 𝐴0

and
𝑎𝐼0 = 𝛿1 𝐴0 − 𝜇𝐼0 − 𝑑𝐼0 .

(1.18)

Solving equations (1.16), (1.17) and (1.18) for 𝛽 𝑁 and 𝐴0 lead to
𝛽𝑁 =

(𝑎 + 𝛿) (𝑎 + 𝜇 + 𝑑) 𝑎 𝜏
𝛿1
𝑒 and 𝐼0 =
𝐴0 .
𝑎 + 𝜇 + 𝑑 + 𝛿1

Furthermore, the initial data 𝐴0 (𝜃) and 𝐼0 (𝜃) are given for 𝜃 ∈ [−𝜏, 0] by 𝐴0 (𝜃) =
𝛿1
𝑏𝑎 𝑎 𝜃
𝑒 and 𝐼0 (𝜃) =
𝐴0 (𝜃). We will assume, as in Section 1.3, that the
𝛿2
𝑎+𝜇+𝑑
latency duration varies between 6 and 12 hours. Consequently, 𝛽 𝑁 is estimated
to be between 0.4492 and 0.48 with an average of 0.4596. In this case, the basic
reproduction number varies between 2.96 and 3.174 with 3.03 in average. Finally,
by repeating the same above process between the ﬁrst and last day of lockdown we
can estimate the parameters 𝛽𝑐 and 𝑝 (See Table 1.3). Here, the sum of squared

and 𝑆𝑆𝑅 𝜏=0.5 = 95.55.

1.6 COVID-19 Model with Threshold-Type Delay
Threshold delay equations (TDEs) ensue in a natural way in compartmental models
for which the time in residence in a particular compartment is determined by the
stipulation that a ﬁxed threshold load of an entity is racked up during the time spent
in that compartment. A susceptible individual that is ﬁrst exposed to a pathogen
at time 𝑡 − 𝜎 will become infectious at time 𝑡 provided the individual receives a
suﬃcient load of the virus during the time from 𝑡 − 𝜎 to 𝑡. We will assume that
an individual is exposed to an infectious quantum, 𝑐, which is the unit of SARSCoV-2 viral load needed to produce an infection. Therefore, we will assume that the
infectious SARS-CoV-2 viral load will grow, overcoming the non-speciﬁc immune
response. When the pathogen load has increased to a threshold 𝑄, or equivalently,
when the age since exposure is greater than the latency period 𝜏, we then consider
the individual to be infectious. We assume, as mentioned in [7], that the repeated
exposures to smaller viral loads increase the pathogen load in-host. Furthermore,
since transmission occurs from infected individuals, the pathogen load due to an
exposure will depend on the infected population.
Let 𝑟 be the internal growth rate of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, 𝑏 is the number of
eﬀective contacts between an exposed and infectious individuals, 𝑘 is an adjustable
parameter which measures how soon saturation occurs. Following the modeling
approach in [23], the threshold condition is governed by the following formula
Ψ(𝑡) := 𝑐𝑒

where 𝐴𝑡 + 𝐼𝑢,𝑡 are the history functions of the infectious individuals deﬁned for
𝜉 ∈ [−𝜏 ∞ := − max 𝜙 ∈𝐶 𝜏(𝜙), 0] by
𝐴𝑡 (𝜉) + 𝐼𝑢,𝑡 (𝜉) = 𝐴(𝑡 + 𝜉) + 𝐼𝑢 (𝑡 + 𝜉)
and 𝜏 : 𝐶 ↦→ R+ is a decreasing and continuously diﬀerential map onthe space
of continuous functions,𝐶 := 𝐶 ( [−𝜏 ∞ , 0], R+ ) , satisfying 𝜏(0) = 𝑟1 ln 𝑄𝑐 . Furthermore, 𝐹 is the additive SARS-CoV-2 viral load in the exposed individual due
to multiple exposures to infectious individuals which is given, for 𝑥 ≥ 0, by the
following Holling functional response-type 2
𝐺 (𝑥) =

delay 𝜏 is a challenging task. To overcome this diﬃculty we will estimate the
parameters and perform our simulations using constant initial data. Let 𝐶˜ =

(1.22)

It is experimentally shown that the minimal viral load needed for the infection to
occur in hamsters is 1000 particles (See [10] more details). Thus, we assume that
𝑄 = 1000. Furthermore, since the maximal latency duration 𝜏(0) varies between 6
and 12 hours then, from formula (1.22) the viral load, 𝑐, per each contact will vary
between 𝑄𝑒 −𝑟/2 and 𝑄𝑒 −𝑟/4 with an average of 𝑄𝑒 −𝑟/3 . However, another diﬃculty
we encounter for this model is that the parameters 𝑏, 𝑟 and 𝑘 related to COVID-19
disease are still unknown and we are compelled to fairly adjust them to ﬁt the reported
cases. (See Table 1.4). In this case we will be able to follow the same process as the
one in Subsection 1.5.2 to obtain the remaining model parameters (See Table 1.4).
Furthermore we obtain 𝑆𝑆𝑅𝑠𝑑𝑒 = 94.3.

1.7 Models with Demographic Effects
In the previous section we have omitted births and deaths in our description of
models because it was believed that the time scale of of COVID-19 epidemic is
much shorter than the demographic time scale. Indeed, we have used a time scale
on which the number of births and deaths in unit time is negligible. However, as
mentioned in Section 1.1, there is a possibility that the COVID-19 may not go away

1 Lifting Lockdown Control Measure Assessment for COVID-19.

17

after a short time and could stay for years. Thus, we need to think on a longer time
scale and include a birth rate parameter, 𝜋 𝑆 and a death rate parameter 𝑑 𝑆 . In what
follows, we will reconsider models (1.13) and (1.21) including demographic eﬀects
and we shall give a rigorous mathematical analysis to the both models. The reason
for which we select these models is that model (1.13) is shown to be the best one
to ﬁt well the data while model (1.21), as we will see in Subsection 1.7.2, generates
more complicated behavior then the three other models.

The local behavior of the DFE of system (1.23) is given by the following theorem.
Theorem 1. The boundary steady state 𝐸 of system (1.23) is unstable when 𝑅𝑐 > 1
and locally asymptotically stable when 𝑅𝑐 < 1.
Proof. The characteristic equation associated with the DFE is given by

Δ(𝜆) = (𝜆 + 𝑑 𝑆 ) (𝜆 + 𝛿 + 𝑑 𝑆 ) (𝜆 + 𝜇 + 𝑑 + 𝑑 𝑆 ) − 𝛼𝑒 −𝜂 𝜏 𝑆 (𝜆 + 𝜇 + 𝑑 + 𝛿1 + 𝑑 𝑆 ) 𝑒 −𝜆𝜏 /𝑁 .
Then the associated eigenvalues are given by 𝜆 = −𝑑 𝑆 and the roots of
𝛿˜ (𝜆) = (𝜆 + 𝛿 + 𝑑 𝑆 ) (𝜆 + 𝜇 + 𝑑 + 𝑑 𝑆 ) − 𝛼𝑒 −𝜂 𝜏 𝑆 (𝜆 + 𝜇 + 𝑑 + 𝛿1 + 𝑑 𝑆 ) 𝑒 −𝜆𝜏 /𝑁.

Let 𝜆 be any eigenvalue associated to equation (1.26) with nonnegative real part (i.e.
ℜ𝑒 (𝜆) ≥ 0) and assume that 𝑅𝑐 < 1. Then 𝑒 −ℜ𝑒(𝜆) 𝜏 ≤ 1 and
| 𝜆 + 𝛿 + 𝑑 𝑆 || 𝜆 + 𝜇 + 𝑑 + 𝑑 𝑆 |
≤ 𝛼𝑒 −𝜂 𝜏 𝑆/𝑁.
| 𝜆 + 𝜇 + 𝑑 + 𝛿1 + 𝑑 𝑆 |
On the other hand, it follows from 𝑅𝑐 < 1 that
𝛼𝑒 −𝜂 𝜏 𝑆/𝑁 <

𝜇 + 𝑑 + 𝛿1 + 𝑑 𝑆

| 𝜆 + 𝛿 + 𝑑 𝑆 || 𝜆 + 𝜇 + 𝑑 + 𝑑 𝑆 |
is
| 𝜆 + 𝜇 + 𝑑 + 𝛿1 + 𝑑 𝑆 |
increasing. Consequently, the DFE is locally asymptotically stable. On the other
hand if 𝑅𝑐 > 1 then
This is a contradiction since the map 𝜆 ↦→

𝛿˜ (0) = 𝛿 (𝜇 + 𝑑 + 𝑑 𝑆 ) (1 − 𝑅𝑐 ) < 0.
Then 𝛿˜ has one positive root and the DFE is unstable.
The forward transcritical bifurcation of the endemic equilibrium as 𝑅𝑐 moves
through 1 is stated as follows.
Theorem 2. When 𝑅𝑐 < 1, the endemic equilibrium of system (1.23) is locally
asymptotically stable while the DFE is unstable, and for 𝑅𝑐 > 1 the DFE is unique
and locally asymptotically stable. That is, forward transcritical bifurcation occurs
at 𝑅𝑐 = 1.

It follows that all characteristic roots of Δ are negative. Thus, the local asymptotic
stability of the positive steady state immediately follows. Furthermore, from Theorem
1 we deduce the local behavior of the DFE. This completes the proof.

Theorem 3. The DFE 𝐸 = 𝑆, 0, 0 of (1.27) is unstable when 𝑅𝑐 > 1, and locally
asymptotically stable when 𝑅𝑐 < 1.
Proof. The characteristic equation associated with the DFE is given by
Δ (𝜆) = (𝜆 + 𝛿 + 𝑑 𝑆 ) (𝜆 + 𝜇 + 𝑑 + 𝑑 𝑆 ) − 𝛼𝑒 −𝜂𝜈 (0) 𝑆𝑒 −𝜆𝜈 (0) (𝜆 + 𝜇 + 𝑑 + 𝛿1 + 𝑑 𝑆 ) /𝑁

When 𝜈 = 0 then Δ (𝜆) = 𝜆2 + 𝜇 + 𝑑 + 𝛿 + 𝑑 𝑆 − 𝛼𝑆/𝑁 𝜆+𝛿 (𝜇 + 𝑑 + 𝑑 𝑆 ) (1 − 𝑅𝑐 ) .
Furthermore, we have
(𝛿 + 𝑑 𝑆 ) (𝜇 + 𝑑 + 𝑑 𝑆 ) (𝜇 + 𝑑 + 𝛿 + 𝑑 𝑆 ) ( 𝜇 + 𝑑 + 𝛿1 + 𝑑 𝑆 )
𝜇 + 𝑑 + 𝛿1 + 𝑑 𝑆

Thus, the DFE is stable when 𝜈 = 0 and 𝑅𝑐 < 1. Assume that 𝜈 > 0 and let 𝜔 > 0.

a forward transcritical bifurcation, that is for 𝑅𝑐 > 1, 𝑅𝑐 close to 1, the endemic

Therefore, | 1 − 𝑒 −𝜆𝜈 ( 𝐴) |< 1 which is a contradiction since ℜ𝑒(𝜆) ≥ 0. Consequently, the endemic equilibrium is LAS.

Theorem 5. Assume that case (iii) in Proposition 2 holds true. When 𝑅𝑐 = 1, the
system (1.27) undergoes a backward bifurcation. That is, for 𝑅𝑐 > 1, 𝑅𝑐 close to
1, the endemic equilibrium is the unique equilibrium which is locally asymptotically
stable; and for 𝑅𝑐 < 1 𝑅𝑐 close to 1, the DFE together with an endemic equilibria
are locally asymptotically stable whereas a second endemic equilibrium exists and
is unstable.
Proof. When case (iii) hold, then there exists
 at least two positive steady states,
𝐸 𝑚 = 𝑆 𝑚 , 𝐴𝑚 , 𝐼𝑢𝑚 and 𝐸 𝑀 = 𝑆 𝑀 , 𝐴 𝑀 , 𝐼𝑢𝑀 . The selected equilibria 𝐸 𝑚 and 𝐸 𝑀
we will use are the ﬁrst two solutions 𝐴𝑚 and 𝐴 𝑀 of equation 𝜒(𝑦) = 𝛿𝑁 (𝜇 + 𝑑)such
that 𝜒 ′ ( 𝐴 𝑀 ) < 0 and 𝜒 ′ ( 𝐴𝑚 ) > 0. Thus, the proof of the LAS of equilibrium 𝐸 𝑀
is similar to the one of Theorem 4.
The characteristic equation associated to 𝐸 𝑚 satisﬁes
Δ (0) = 𝛼𝑒 −𝜂𝜈 ( 𝐴𝑚 (𝜁 )) ( 𝐴𝑚 (𝜁 ) + 𝐼𝑚 (𝜁 )) 𝑆 𝑚 (𝜁 ) (𝜇 + 𝑑 + 𝑑 𝑆 ) 𝜒 ′ ( 𝐴𝑚 )/𝑁.
Consequently Δ(0) < 0 and, since lim𝜆→∞ Δ(𝜆) = +∞, then there exists 𝜆∗ > 0
such that Δ(𝜆∗ ) = 0. This concludes the proof of the theorem.
The existence of a backward bifurcation is an interesting artifact since this means
that repeated exposures of susceptibles to the SARS-CoV-2 virus can cause bistability dynamics and, subsequently, infection persistence even when the control
reproduction number 𝑅𝑐 is less than unity. An interesting query that emanates from
the backward bifurcation is “What is the maximum eﬀective contact number, 𝑏,
or viral load per each contact, 𝑐, below which the COVID-19 disappear one we
reduce 𝑅𝑐 below one?”. Note that, as mentioned and proved in [23], in the case
of single exposure model (1.27) is a system of constant-delay diﬀerential equations
which is equivalent to system (1.23). Moreover, no backward bifurcation occurs.
Generally, there is a threshold 𝑏 ∗ below which the backward bifurcation disappear
(The proof is similar to the one in [23]). This result could have a signiﬁcant biological
interpretation since, as stated in [10], minimization of exposure to SARS-COV-2 is
key to reducing the chance of infection and developing disease.

1.8 Discussion
Since the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic, numerous mathematical models with
increasing complexity are developed worldwide to understand the course of COVID19 disease. The modeling results have shown a wide large of variations, especially in
the basic reproduction numbers. This lead to ask some questions such as: Why these
variations exist between models? Which model is the most realistic for the COVID19 disease? WHO had reported that the basic reproduction number is estimated to
be between 1.4 and 2.5 [26] while other interesting contributions reported that the
COVID-19 is more transmissible than what WHO mentioned. In [16], the authors
estimated, through a comparison study of 12 diﬀerent results, that the median value of
𝑅0 for COVID-19 is expected to be around 2−3. However, only 6 among these studies
have used mathematical models leading to a higher variation of 𝑅0 (1.5 − 6.49), with
an average of 4.2. Another systematic review in [14] screened 75 mathematical and
statistical models published between December 1𝑠𝑡 2019 and February 21𝑠𝑡 2020
and concluded that the median of 𝑅0 for COVID-19 was 3.77.
Fig. 1.1 Time series plot for
model (1.1), starting from
March 21, 2020, of the numbers of reported individuals
change using diﬀerent lifting rates at diﬀerent times
as follows: 30% of the total
population is lifted on June
10 (dot line) and a fraction 𝛾
of the remaining conﬁned individuals (𝛾 = 0.3, 𝛾 = 0.4,
and 𝛾 = 0.5, solid line,
dashed line and dot-dashed
line respectively) is lifted on
September 1𝑠𝑡 .

In this chapter, we developed, ﬁtted and compared four mathematical models with
increasing complexity, that incorporate lifting lockdown strategy, to check out which
one among them provides the best prediction for COVID-19 disease. We considered
a progressive relaxation of the compulsory lockdown performed in two stages and
supported by a reduction of 60% of the contact rate. In the ﬁrst stage 30 % of the
total conﬁned population lifted the lockdown on June 10th while, in the second stage
another 30% lifted the lockdown on September 1st. Our investigation of the proposed
models showed a small variation of 𝑅0 ranging from 2.06 to 3.03, and according to
the 𝑆𝑆𝑅 measure (see Section 1.3), the best ﬁt of reported data is achieved for the
model with constant delay (1.13) with 𝑆𝑆𝑅 = 92.63. Consequently, our results show
that model (1.13) is the most reliable to estimate the value of 𝑅0 (𝑅0 = 3.03), which
is higher than those estimated by models (1.1), (1.10) and (1.21).

Fig. 1.2 Time series plot for
model (1.10), starting from
March 21, 2020, of the numbers of reported individuals
change using diﬀerent lifting rates at diﬀerent times
as follows: 30% of children and 30% of adults are
lifted on June 10 (dot line)
and a fraction 𝛾 of the remaining conﬁned individuals
((𝛾𝑎 = 0.115, 𝛾𝑐 = 0.8) ,
(𝛾𝑎 = 0.25, 𝛾𝑐 = 0.8) , and
(𝛾𝑎 = 0.39, 𝛾𝑐 = 0.8) , solid
line, dashed line, dot-dashed
line respectively) is lifted on
September 1𝑠𝑡 .

Although it is believed that the discrete structured-age model (1.10) is more
realistic, our investigations show that this model is the least accurate of any of
the models used to estimate the basic reproduction number 𝑅0 since its 𝑆𝑆𝑅 is
the highest one with 𝑆𝑆𝑅 = 98.76. This lead us to think to extend the proposed
models by gathering both age and constant delay factors at once. On the other hand,
using our proposed models, the examination of the lockdown lifting scenario shows
a prominent diﬀerence between disease predictions. Furthermore, no eradication
of COVID19 disease is observed before the end of the year when relaxing the
compulsory lockdown on September 1st. The discrete structure-age model (1.10),
which have estimate the lowest 𝑅0 value, predict a less severe disease persistence
when comparing with the other models. Lifting 30% of the total conﬁned population
on June 10th will lead to a slight second wave of infection followed by a rapid
decrease till the eradication of the disease before the end of the year.

However, if this strategy is accompanied with a second lockdown lifting of at
least 30% of the total conﬁned population (11.5% of adults and 80% of children
under 15 years old) on September 1st then the extinction of the virus cannot happen
( Fig. 1.2) and a third wave could arise. However, it is obvious that the reopening
of primary and junior high schools does not lead to an important wave of infection,
when comparing with models (1.1), (1.13) and (1.21). Figures (1.1), (1.3) and (1.4)
show, however, that no second wave will reoccur but a longer lasting persistence of
the infection occurs when 30% of the population lifted on June 10th.

model (1.21), starting from
March 21, 2020, of the numbers of reported individuals
change using diﬀerent lifting rates at diﬀerent times
as follows: 30% of the total
population is lifted on June
10 (dot line) and a fraction
𝛾 of the remaining conﬁned individuals (𝛾 = 0.3,
𝛾 = 0.4, and 𝛾 = 0.5, solid
line, dashed line, dot-dashed
line respectively) is lifted on
September 1𝑠𝑡 .

However, when comparing with the both basic model (1.1) and constant delay
model (1.13), threshold-type delay model (1.21) show a higher size of reported cases
as well as an important second wave when a second stage of lifting lockdown strategy
occurs on September 1st. Furthermore, it seems that the latency period inﬂuence the
model ﬁtting to data. Figure (1.5) and the 𝑆𝑆𝑅 measure (𝑆𝑆𝑅 𝜏=0.33 = 92.63 ), related
to the delay model (1.13), shows that the constant delay model with latency period
of 8 hours is the best ﬁt to data and, thus, this period gives a better prediction than 6
or 12 hours of latency.

In summary, there are no mathematical models able to correctly capture all
complexity of COVID-19 disease in general. Each model, either simple or complex,
has its own advantages and disadvantages. Besides the availability of data, the choice
of model depends on the goal sought by scientists to answer a question of interest.
Furthermore, the use of complex models does not necessarily provide the most
precise answers than the simplest. Indeed, since many biological and epidemiological
issues related to SARS-CoV-2 remain to be clariﬁed, parameters considered in the
proposed model can be underestimated or overestimated and, consequently, can
lead to wrong results. An unsuccessful evaluation of the disease behavior could
cost serious damage because it lead to an incorrect estimate of the control health
measures that are necessary to contain the disease transmission. However, although
a lot of issues must be considered to provide the built model a maximum of realism,
mathematical modeling remains a crucial tool to understand and control the behavior
of COVID-19 disease.
