ABSTRACT
The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) began in Wuhan,
China in late 2019 and to date has infected over 14M people worldwide, resulting in over 750,000 deaths1 . On March 10, 2020 the
World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a global
pandemic. Many academics and researchers, not restricted to the
medical domain, began publishing papers describing new discoveries. However, with the large influx of publications, it was hard for
these individuals to sift through the large amount of data and make
sense of the findings. The White House and a group of industry
research labs, lead by the Allen Institute for AI, aggregated over
200,000 journal articles related to a variety of coronaviruses and
tasked the community with answering key questions related to the
corpus, releasing the dataset as CORD-19. The information retrieval
(IR) community repurposed the journal articles within CORD-19 to
more closely resemble a classic TREC-style competition, dubbed
TREC-COVID, with human annotators providing relevancy judgements at the end of each round of competition. Seeing the related
endeavors, we set out to repurpose the relevancy annotations for
TREC-COVID tasks to identify journal articles in CORD-19 which
are relevant to the key questions posed by CORD-19. A BioBERT
model trained on this repurposed dataset prescribes relevancy annotations for CORD-19 tasks that have an overall agreement of
0.4430 with majority human annotations in terms of Cohen’s kappa.
We present the methodology used to construct the new dataset and
describe the decision process used throughout.

INTRODUCTION

The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) began in Wuhan,
China in late 2019 and to date has infected over 14M people worldwide, resulting in over 750,000 deaths2 . On March 10, 2020 the
World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a global
pandemic. Many academics and researchers, not restricted to the
medical domain, began publishing papers presenting new discoveries related to COVID-19. Although well intentioned, the huge
increase of publications about COVID-19 made it difficult for medical professionals to sift through the data and identify actionable
insights.
Hoping to encourage a more unified, organized investigation
into the virus, the White House and a group of leading research labs
1 https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/
2 https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/

in industry, lead by the Allen Institute for AI, released the CORD19 dataset in March of 2020 [17]. The dataset contains academic
journal articles relating to a variety of coronavirus and related
viral infections, not only COVID-19, sourced from PubMed Central
(PMC), PubMed, the World Health Organization (WHO), bioRxiv,
medRxiv, and arXiv. Furthermore, the dataset is accompanied by 10
key questions that the community has been tasked with answering.
As a consequence of the CORD-19 dataset not indicating which
journal articles are helpful in answering each of the key questions
posed, many of the initial efforts were positioned as clustering
or data exploration studies [4, 7, 12]. However, some individuals
have taken it upon themselves to assemble well-structured, taskspecific datasets from a subset of documents in CORD-19. Two such
datasets for question answering are CovidQA [13] and RECORD
(Research Engine for COVID Open Research Dataset) [10]. While
these datasets are a valuable resource to the community, their heavy
reliance on human annotation limits their utility and scalability as
each dataset contains less than 150 records.
The information retrieval (IR) community reframed the key questions asked in CORD-19 to more closely resemble a TREC competition, calling the resulting competition TREC-COVID [16]. In each
round of competition contestants are given a list of queries, or tasks,
for which related documents are desired. Contestants then perform
the queries using their proposed model, returning an ordered list
of documents expected to be relevant to the query. To assess the
performance of teams participating in the competition, human annotators prescribe relevancy annotations to journal articles that
are returned most often for each task in TREC-COVID at the end
of each round of competition.
Although these two activities have received much attention from
their respective communities, they are usually viewed in isolation.
That is, efforts towards answering the queries associated with TRECCOVID have not been directly leveraged towards answering the key
questions posed by CORD-19. While valuable human annotations
have been obtained for TREC-COVID tasks, ground-truth labels for
CORD-19 task have yet to be obtained even though it asks similar
questions on the same dataset.
Our initial attempts to train a model to perform both the TRECCOVID and CORD-19 tasks, either through multitask-learning or
transfer learning, proved unfruitful. Learning to perform both sets
of tasks in unison results in inferior performance than if the tasks
were learned separately. This was an indication to us to focus more
so on how annotated data can be repurposed instead of repurposing
a model already trained to perform a specific task.
We therefore present a method for re-purposing the labeled data
for one task, TREC-COVID, for a task for which labeled training

data is unavailable or only available in limited quantities, CORD19. Our method begins by first defining a manual mapping from
TREC-COVID tasks to CORD-19 tasks such that labels for the TRECCOVID task can be reused as labels for the corresponding CORD-19
task. We train a BioBERT model to make relevancy predictions for
each CORD-19 task and compare the model’s performance against
that of three human annotators. We then employ a variety of techniques to refine the mapping between tasks until optimal model
performance is reached.
In total, our contributions are as follows:
• Demonstrate the ability of a BioBERT model to learn to make
relevancy predictions for TREC-COVID tasks, achieving a
true positive rate and true negative rate of 0.75% and 0.88%,
respectively.
• Present a method for repurposing the annotations from
TREC-COVID towards answering the key questions of CORD19, achieving a Cohen’s kappa of 0.443 with majority agreement human annotations.

2 RELATED LITERATURE
2.1 Language Modeling
Language modeling (LM) is a long-studied discipline in Natural
Language Processing (NLP) in which a model is tasked with learning
the underlying distribution and relation between words in a predetermined vocabulary [6]. It has become common practice for
a language model (LM) to first be pre-trained on a large, general
purpose corpus before being fine-tuned for a domain-specific NLP
task. Leveraging a LM in such a capacity has lead to new state-ofthe-art performance in a variety of natural language understanding
(NLU) and natural language inference (NLI) tasks [3, 9, 11]. One of
the more widely adopted pre-trained LM was released in late 2018
by Devlin et al dubbed BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representation
from Transformers) [2]. BERT was trained using two pre-training
tasks: 1) Masked Language Modeling (MLM) and Next Sentence
Prediction (NSP). For MLM, 15% of tokens in the input sequence
were randomly masked and BERT was asked to impute the missing
tokens. In the NSP task, BERT was presented with two sentences
and asked to predict whether or not the appear next to each other
in a source document.
2.1.1 BioBERT. Although the vanilla BERT model was shown to
achieve strong performance on tasks making use of a more general
vernacular, it struggled to adapt to some domain-specific applications which made use of a highly specialized vocabulary. To this end,
Lee et al performed further pre-training of BERT using a corpus
from the bio-medical domain, naming the new model BioBERT [8].
Starting from the weights of the vanilla BERT model, BioBERT was
further pre-trained on an 18B word corpora composed of PubMed
abstracts and full-text articles from PMC. BioBERT was shown
to achieve new state-of-the-art performance on a variety of NLP
tasks tailored to the bio-medical domain including named entity
recognition (NER) and question answering (QA) among others [8].

2.2

COVID-19 and CORD-19

Lead by the Allen Institute for AI and the White House, a consortium of industry leaders aggregated academic journal articles

related to COVID-19 and other coronaviruses, releasing the dataset
to the public as CORD-19 [17]. The dataset and supplemental material are freely available on Kaggle3 .
Sonbhadra et al [12] present a method for identifying journal
articles relevant to each of the 10 CORD-19 tasks. The proposed
method begins by clustering articles in CORD-19 based on their TFIDF embeddings and training a one-class support vector machine
(OCSVM) to identify samples belonging to each centroid. Next,
doc2vec is used to create ebmeddings that represent each centroid
and each Kaggle task. These embeddings are then used to calculate
the cosine similarity, and consequently the association between,
each centroid and Kaggle task. Although this method achieves high
levels of performance with F1 scores approaching 0.999, the ground
truth labels are assumed based on embedding vector similarity
without human confirmation. It shows strong ability to identify
which set of centroids a particular journal was assigned to, but
whether or not the journal articles assigned to that centroid are
truly relevant to the task is not confirmed.
The National Institute of Health (NIH) also compiled a dataset
of articles related to the ongoing pandemic and released to the
community as LitCovid [1]. Articles in this dataset are sourced
from PubMed and exclusively discuss COVID-19. The dataset contains around 8,000 articles each annotated as one or more of the
following categories: General, Transmission, Treatment, Case report, Forecasting, Prevention, Mechanism, and Diagnosis. Gutierrez
et al assessed the performance of a variety of neural architectures
on the dataset, including LSTM, CNN, BERT, BioBERT, and other
transformer-based models [5]. Ultimately, the group found that
BioBERT and the Longformer, a variant of the transformer architecture [15], produced the best results with an micro-F1 score and
accuracy of 81% and 69%, respectively, on the test set. BioBERT consistently outperformed the vanilla BERT models throughout their
experiments, demonstrating the benefit of utilizing a LM fine-tuned
for the biomedical domain.

2.3

Transfer Learning

As defined by Torrey et al, transfer learning (TL) “... is the improvement of learning in a new task through the transfer of knowledge
from a related task that has already been learned” [14]. For a simple,
pertinent example we remind the reader of the process of pretraining a LM on a large, general purpose before fine-tuning it for a
specific task. In doing so, the model first learns general knowledge
about words in the vocabulary being learned before refining it’s
understanding for optimal performance on a specific task.
TL is typically discussed with respect to the model - i.e. a model
learning to perform task B will make use of what it learned in
learning to perform task A. In our experiments, however, we utilized
TL in the data space instead of the model space. Human annotators
prescribed relevancy annotations for journal articles in CORD-19
with respect to TREC-COVID tasks, and using those labels, we
re-purpose the dataset such that it can be used to train a model
to perform a new task. The knowledge obtained from the TRECCOVID annotations is never truly “shared” with the model learning
to prescribe CORD-19 relevancy annotations, but used to re-purpose
the dataset for a new task.

Question Answering

Although CORD-19 on it’s own is a completely unstructured dataset,
some individuals have taken it upon themselves to assemble wellstructured, task-specific datasets from a subset of documents in
CORD-19. Two such datasets are CovidQA [13] and RECORD (Research
Engine for COVID Open Research Dataset) [10]. Both datasets
present a model with a query and a context string, asking the
model to identify the span of text in the context that most accurately responds to the query. Due to the reliance on human labor to
construct these fine-grain, task-specific datasets, the datasets only
contain 124 and 112 question-answer pairs, respectively.

3 DATASETS
3.1 TREC-COVID
The TREC community answered the call to action against COVID19 by announcing the TREC-COVID competition [16]. Similar to
many other TREC competitions, participants are given a set of
queries and asked to find documents that are relevant to the query.
In TREC-COVID, the system returns relevant articles in the CORD19 dataset [17]. In each round of the competition, participants submit a list of articles returned for each query, ordered by predicted
likelihood of relevancy. At the end of each round, human annotators
annotate the articles that were most often returned for each query,
and they are then used to score submissions. As of completion of
round three of the competition, a total of 16,677 unique journal
articles in CORD-19 have received a relevancy annotation with
respect to one or more TREC-COVID tasks.
TREC-COVID began with 30 tasks, or “queries”, and adds 5 tasks
for each round of the competition. Each task is expressed in three
ways: 1) as a query, typically a few words in length, i.e. “coronavirus
origin”, 2) as a question, which poses the query in a slightly longer
form, i.e. “what is the origin of COVID-19”, and 3) as a narrative,
which further expands upon the corresponding question and query,
i.e. “seeking range of information about the SARS-CoV-2 virus’s origin,
including its evolution, animal source, and first transmission into
humans”. The queries for the 40 tasks included in round three of
the TREC-COVID challenge are presented in table 1.

3.2

CORD-19

Organized by the White House, Allen AI, and leading research
groups, this dataset contains almost 200,000 journal articles about
COVID-19 and related coronaviruses, around 80,000 of which contain the full text of the article [17]. The dataset poses 10 “key questions” to the community, presented in table 2.
Journal articles in the CORD-19 dataset come from sources such
as PubMed Central (PMC), PubMed, the World Health Organization
(WHO), bioRxiv, medRxiv, and arXiv. The dataset does not exclusively focus on COVID-19 and includes journal articles relating
to other viruses such as MERS, H1N1, and SARS. New articles are
periodically added to the dataset as they become available. The
version of the dataset used throughout this study, unless otherwise
noted, was published on July 6, 2020.

METHODOLOGY

Although the CORD-19 dataset contains over 80,000 full-text academic articles and poses 10 key questions, it gives no indication
as to which articles are helpful for answering the questions being
asked. However, the TREC-COVID competition is asking similar
questions about the same journal articles and provides human relevancy annotations for each task at the end of each round. Seeing this
opportunity, the backbone of our methodology is the re-purposing
of labeled data for one task, TREC-COVID, for use in a separate,

nodes are only performed once at the beginning of the investigation while actions in blue nodes are iteratively performed until optimal performance is reached.
We first create a manual mapping from TREC-COVID tasks to
CORD-19 tasks and train a BioBERT model to predict whether or
not a journal excerpt is relevant to each CORD-19 task. Next, for
each CORD-19 task 20 journal articles are sampled and three human
annotators gave relevancy annotations for the sampled articles and
corresponding task. These annotations are used to assess model
performance and the mapping between tasks is iteratively refined
until optimal performance is reached. A diagram of the workflow
in our methodology is presented in figure 1.

Table 3: Original manual mapping from TREC-COVID tasks
to CORD-19 tasks

author was asked to give their “best guess” judgement as to which
of the TREC-COVID tasks would best align with each of the Kaggle
CORD-19 tasks. The initial manual mapping was defined using task
descriptions from round 3 of TREC-COVID and is presented below
in table 3.
4.1.1 Constructing Dataset. To frame the problem as a supervised
learning task, we repurpose annotations for TREC-COVID tasks to
serve as ground truth labels for the corresponding CORD-19 tasks.
When constructing the training set for CORD-19 task i, we first
identify the set of journal articles, J , that have received annotations
for TREC-COVID tasks which are mapped on to CORD-19 task i.
Since the majority of CORD-19 tasks have multiple TREC-COVID
tasks mapped to them and a journal article may receive an annotation for more than one TREC-COVID task, it is possible for a
journal article j, j ∈ J , to have multiple, inconsistent labels for
CORD-19 task i appropriated from corresponding TREC-COVID
tasks. For example, if journal article j was annotated as “relevant”
for TREC-COVID task x but “not relevant” for TREC-COVID task
y, and both TREC-COVID tasks x and y are mapped to CORD-19
task i, j would be labeled as both “relevant” and “not relevant” for
CORD-19 task i. If such a situation were to occur, j would not be
included in the training set for CORD-19 task i.
Individual records in the dataset consist of either the abstract or
conclusion of a journal article. If available, the title of the journal
article was prepended to either the abstract or conclusion. Therefore, any individual journal articles in CORD-19 may manifest as
at most two records in the repurposed dataset.
Each item in the newly constructed dataset is accompanied by an
auxiliary sentence corresponding to the key question of the CORD19 task for which the item represents. The input to the BioBERT
model is formatted as follows:
[CLS] JOURNAL TEXT [SEP] AUX. SENTENCE [SEP]
In doing so, the model is learning a task that is similar to it’s NSP
pre-training task.

Manual Task Mapping

The initial mapping between the TREC-COVID tasks and the CORD19 tasks was done manually by one of the authors. Given the full
details of both the TREC-COVID and Kaggle CORD-19 tasks, the

4.2

Human Annotation

In order to gauge a model’s ability to prescribe relevancy predictions for the Kaggle tasks, we require a set of ground truth labels

to compare it’s predictions against. To this end, three human annotators were asked to annotate 20 journal articles for each Kaggle
task resulting in 200 total annotations each. The human annotators
were not experts in the bio-medical domain and were asked to prescribe annotations with respect to the general, medical domain. Put
differently, the text being annotated need not be directly related to
COVID-19 for it to be annotated as relevant if the content of the text
answers the posed question. For example, a paragraph discussing
the transmission of the H1N1 virus is to be marked relevant for
Kaggle task 1 although it is not describing COVID-19 in particular.
This was done to make the model more amenable to generalization
in other viral applications and corpora.
4.2.1 Revising Annotations. As none of the annotators were experts
in the bio-medical domain, the initial annotations were expected
to contain at least some level of noise due to misunderstanding
of domain terminology, Kaggle task definitions and/or scope, and
requirements for a journal to be deemed relevant. After the three
annotators gave their independent annotations, they met with the
project PI to discuss items that the annotators did not agree on the
correct annotation. During this time the group ensured that the
annotators had a common understanding of domain terminology,
task descriptions, and relevancy requirements. If the annotators
could not reach a consensus agreement on their own, the project PI
would cast the deciding vote. Annotators were then asked to revise
their original annotations with the insights from this meeting in
mind. After revisions, the annotations from our three non-expert
annotators had an agreement of 0.3744 in terms of Fleiss’ kappa.
When compared to the majority agreement annotations, the annotators had agreements of 0.6587, 0.7538, and 0.5411 in terms of
Cohen’s kappa.

4.3

Refining Task Mappings

When comparing the predictions of a BioBERT model trained using
the manual mapping with the human annotations, it was clear that
the model was able to identify some sort of meaningful signal in the
data, but higher of levels of performance were desired. To this end
we explored how the data at our disposal, including newly obtained
human annotations for CORD-19 tasks, could be used to refine the
manual mapping between the TREC-COVID and CORD-19 tasks.
4.3.1 TREC-COVID Model. Given that we obtained 20 human annotations for each of the ten Kaggle tasks, we wanted to see if the
documents that were annotated for the Kaggle tasks were also annotated for a TREC-COVID task. As of round 3 of the TREC-COVID
competition, only 9 of the documents that received a human annotation for the Kaggle tasks received an annotation for any TRECCOVID task. However, to make further use of our annotations, we
train another BioBERT model to prescribe COVID-TREC relevancy
annotations for each of the 40 tasks in round 3 of TREC-COVID.
Since we are not expecting this model to be highly competitive in the TREC-COVID competition, we relax the rules of the
competition slightly and reframe the task as a binary instead of
tertiary classification problem. Items in the TREC-COVID dataset
that received an annotation of “somewhat relevant” were adjusted
to have a label of “relevant.” More concretely, the BioBERT model

was asked to predict if a text snippet is either “not relevant” or
“relevant” for a particular TREC-COVID task.
Our TREC-COVID BioBERT model is then applied to each of
the 200 journal articles that received human annotations for the
Kaggle tasks, making relevancy predictions for each of the 40 TRECCOVID tasks. A relevancy prediction less 0.5 was taken as “not
relevant” while any prediction greater than or equal to 0.5 was taken
as “relevant.” These relevancy predictions for the TREC-COVID
tasks can then be viewed with respect to the human relevancy
predictions for the Kaggle tasks, revising the mapping between the
two sets of tasks accordingly.
4.3.2 Automatic Task Mapping. To further refine the manually
prescribed task mappings, we explore a variety of options for automatically mapping tasks in TREC-COVID to those in CORD-19
based on different data sources and data representations. In one
method of obtaining automatic mappings, BioBERT was used to
create an embedding vector for each task in both TREC-COVID
and CORD-19. The similarity of each TREC-COVID task to each
CORD-19 task was measured using cosine similarity.
Additionally, term frequency vectors were created to represent
each of the TREC-COVID and CORD-19 tasks. Articles marked as
relevant to each task were included in the construction of each
embedding vector, with ngrams up to size n=5 considered. Again,
the similarity of each TREC-COVID task to each CORD-19 task
was measured using cosine similarity.

EXPERIMENTS

In all experiments a BioBERT-base-cased model was fine-tuned using
an Adam optimizer with lr=5e −6 , β 1 = 0.9, and β 2 = 0.999. Models
trained to perform the CORD-19 tasks were trained for 20 epochs
while models performing the TREC-COVID tasks were trained for
only 10 epochs. In both cases, a decaying learning rate with a 10%
warmup was employed.

5.1

Manual Mapping

We begin experiments by fine-tuning a BioBERT model to make
relevancy predictions for each CORD-19 task using original manual
mapping between tasks, as presented in table 3. The model had
optimal agreement with the majority annotations with a relevancy
threshold of 50%. The model’s performance, described in terms of
Cohen’s kappa, is presented below in figure 2.

5.2

TREC-COVID Model

When fine-tuning the BioBERT model to make relevancy predictions for the TREC-COVID dataset, the incomplete nature of the
annotations necessitate the problem being framed as a binary, onevs-all classification problem. The model was trained using annotations for round 3 of the TREC-COVID competition and the resulting
performance is described in table 4.
Once trained, the TREC-COVID model is then applied to the
journal articles in CORD-19 that were manually annotated for the
CORD-19 tasks. For each article, the model makes 40 binary predictions as to the relevancy of the article to each of the TREC-COVID
tasks. For an article to be considered relevant for a particular TRECCOVID task, the model must be no less than 50% confident the
article excerpt is relevant.

Next, for each TREC-COVID task we identify the set of journal
excerpts, T, that the TREC-COVID model believes are relevant to
that task. Then, for each CORD-19 task i, we calculate the number of
relevant annotations minus the number of not-relevant annotations
for that task i. The results of this process are presented below in
table 5.

Automatic Task Mapping

As mentioned above, we explored the use of BioBERT and term
frequency embeddings when automatically mapping TREC-COVID
tasks to CORD-19 tasks. The BioBERT model provided by Lee et al is

Table 6: Optimal mapping from TREC-COVID tasks to

used to create the BioBERT embeddings [8]. When using BioBERT
embeddings, one input sequence was generated for each task in
both TREC-COVID and CORD-19. When constructing the input for
TREC-COVID tasks, the input is the task query and for CORD-19
tasks the input is the key question for each task. The results of our
automatic task mapping method using BioBERT embeddings are
presented below in figure 3.
When using term-frequency-based embeddings to calculate an
automatic mapping between tasks, we are not restricted by BioBERT’s
maximum input sequence length, so we can construct an embedding using more information for each task. We therefore create
term-frequency embeddings that make use of articles annotated
as relevant for each task when constructing the embeddings. As
mentioned above, ngrams up to size n=5 are included. The results of
the term-frequency-based automatic task mappings are presented
below in figure 4. In the figure, similarity scores are normalized
with respect to each CORD-19 task.

5.4

Optimal Task Mapping

Using the insights gleamed from applying the TREC-COVID model
and the different methods to automatically map TREC-COVID task
to CORD-19 tasks, we adjusted the originally defined task mapping.
The mapping that lead to optimal performance is described in table
6 and corresponding performance metrics are presented in figure
5. The decision process used when adjusting the mapping will be
further explained in the Discussion sections.

5.5

Performance Assessment

Both the CORD-19 and TREC-COVID competitions were active
during our experiments, releasing new versions of their respective
datasets as more journal articles become available. The majority
of our experiments were performed during round 3 of the TRECCOVID competition, but we wanted to assess the impact of additional annotations with each round of competition. We therefore
trained a BioBERT model to prescribe CORD-19 relevancy annotations using the identified optimal task mapping based on data
from rounds 1-4 of the TREC-COVID competition. Furthermore,
we trained a vanilla BERT model to perform this task as well to
assess the performance that further in-domain pre-training had
on resulting model performance. The performance achieved from

DISCUSSION

In consulting figure 2 we see that a BioBERT model trained to
make relevancy annotations for CORD-19 tasks using the manually
defined task mapping shows promising performance. The model
shows a strong ability to make accurate annotations for CORD-19
task 10, but the same cannot be said for tasks 3, 4, 5, 8, and 9 half of the ten CORD-19 tasks. When compared against majority
annotations, the model has an agreement of 0.2853 in terms of
Cohen’s kappa.
To squeeze more utility out of the human annotations for CORD19 tasks, we consulted the results from applying the TREC-COVID
model to journal articles which received human annotation. In
doing so we are able to gain a better understanding of not only
which TREC-COVID tasks correlate positively with CORD-19 tasks,
but also those that correlate negatively with CORD-19 tasks. For
example, TREC-COVID task 30 (“Is remdesivir an effective treatment for COVID-19?”) was not mapped to CORD-19 task 3 in the
manual mapping. However, in table 5 we see that journal articles
our TREC-COVID model thinks are relevant to TREC-COVID task
30 receive three more “relevant” than “not relevant” human annotations for CORD-19 task 3, suggesting TREC-COVID task 30
should be mapped to CORD-19 task 3. Furthermore, journal articles
that our TREC-COVID model thinks are relevant to TREC-COVID
task 17 receive eight fewer “relevant” than “not relevant” human
annotations for CORD-19 task 1, suggesting the mapping should
be removed. We use these findings to adjust the mapping between
tasks accordingly if the suggested adjustment passes a simple human sanity-check.
Turning the results of the automatic mapping methods to actionable insights required a larger degree of human intervention.
Both of the methods appear capable of identifying seemingly sound
correlations between two sets of tasks, but upon further inspection,
some suggested mappings do not make logical sense. For example, TREC-COVID task 12 had the highest cosine similarity, 0.88,
with CORD-19 task 9 based on BioBERT embeddings. This TRECCOVID task was not manually mapped to CORD-19 task 19 in
the original manual mappings, but was in the optimal mappings.
However, TREC-COVID task 6 had the highest cosine similarity,
0.93 for CORD-19 task 2. When looking at table 5 we see that
journal articles our TREC-COVID model believes are relevant to
TREC-COVID task 6 receive six fewer “relevant” than “not relevant”
human annotations for CORD-19 task 2.
When trained using the optimal mapping from TREC-COVID
tasks to CORD-19 tasks, our BioBERT model had an agreement

CONCLUSION

Facing a global pandemic, researchers and medical professionals
around the world have organized to fight against COVID-19. Although well intentioned, a huge surge in publications made it difficult for health experts to sift through the data and turn new discoveries into actionable insights. Multiple communities assumed
the burden of alleviating this issue, constructing datasets and organizing competitions, but each community had a slightly different
approach to doing so. Although all communities were working
towards a shared goal, artifacts resulting from one community are
not always fully utilized by others, with one example being the
human relevancy annotations from TREC-COVID. In our method
presented above we demonstrate how the annotations for TRECCOVID tasks can be repurposed to answer the key questions being
asked by CORD-19.

relevancy predictions for CORD-19 tasks using the optimal
mappings between the two sets of tasks.

of 0.4430 with majority annotations in terms of Cohen’s kappa.
In comparison with the original mapping, annotator agreement
improved for all CORD-19 tasks except for tasks 4 and 10.
In looking at table 7 we see that the performance of a BioBERT
model is relatively constant regardless of which round of TRECCOVID data was used to construct the training set. This table also
shows the performance improvement which can be realized by pretraining a LM in the domain in which it will be deployed, with the
vanilla BERT model consistently performing worse than BioBERT.
