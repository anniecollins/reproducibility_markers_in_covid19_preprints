Abstract—Can one learn to diagnose COVID-19 under extreme
minimal supervision? Since the outbreak of the novel COVID19 there has been a rush for developing Artificial Intelligence
techniques for expert-level disease identification on Chest Xray data. In particular, the use of deep supervised learning has
become the go-to paradigm. However, the performance of such
models is heavily dependent on the availability of a large and
representative labelled dataset. The creation of which is a heavily
expensive and time consuming task, and especially imposes a
great challenge for a novel disease. Semi-supervised learning
has shown the ability to match the incredible performance of
supervised models whilst requiring a small fraction of the labelled
examples. This makes the semi-supervised paradigm an attractive
option for identifying COVID-19. In this work, we introduce
a graph based deep semi-supervised framework for classifying
COVID-19 from chest X-rays. Our framework introduces an
optimisation model for graph diffusion that reinforces the natural
relation among the tiny labelled set and the vast unlabelled
data. We then connect the diffusion prediction output as pseudolabels that are used in an iterative scheme in a deep net. We
demonstrate, through our experiments, that our model is able
to outperform the current leading supervised model with a tiny
fraction of the labelled examples. Finally, we provide attention
maps to accommodate the radiologist’s mental model, better
fitting their perceptual and cognitive abilities. These visualisation
aims to assist the radiologist in judging whether the diagnostic
is correct or not, and in consequence to accelerate the decision.

I. I NTRODUCTION
INCE the outbreak of the novel coranavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), there have been more
than 30 million confirmed infected cases and more than 1
million deaths has been reported worldwide (as on September
1st). This threat has encouraged joint efforts to obtain accurate
early detection of COVID-19 to try and limit the spread of the
pandemic.
Whilst real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) COVID-19 test is the current gold standard
for diagnostis, this type of test has demonstrated several limits
and burdens. Firstly, it is prone to false negatives that heavily

rely on the sample acquisition characteristics including insufficient quantities and location (nasal, throat or sputum) [1], [2].
Secondly, the limitation of several world regions in obtaining
fast accessibility to the test. The use of imaging techniques,
including computerised tomography and chest x-rays, has
been suggested as a parallel option to RT-PCR test. Clinical
manifestation of COVID-19 is that of a respiratory infection,
which is associated with viral pneumonia. To distinguish viral
pneumonia from bacterial pneumonia is a challenging task.
This task becomes even harder when a large number of
suspected patients need to be screened. This time consuming
task strains already limited medical resources, thus reducing
the efficiency of the diagnostic.
Computerised tomography (CT) has been a focus of attention in the literature for COVID-19 e.g. [3], [4]. However, the
burden imposed in terms of infection control using CT scan
suites and the inefficiencies relating to room decontamination
and access restriction from several world regions make CT
challenging to be used as a routinely basis – despite its high
sensitivity [5]. Due to its wide availability and inexpensive
screening, a great focus has been placed on Chest X-rays
(CXR) for both clinical and AI areas e.g. [6]–[9]. These advantages make CXR a perfect alternative and complement to the
RT-PCR. Despite the CXRs advantages, accurate interpretation
still remains a challenge [10]. This is because the accuracy of
the interpretation relies on the radiologist’s expertise level and
there is still a substantial clinical error on the outcome [11].
Therefore, there is an urge for fast automated evaluations of
CXRs, to quickly explore the vast amount of data which will
save time in evaluating the diseases.
For the task of classifying COVID-19 using CXRs data,
there has been a fast development of deep learning techniques e.g. [12]–[16], in which supervised learning is the goto paradigm. However, the performance of these techniques
strongly rely on a large and representative corpus of labelled
data. In the medical domain and in particular with a new
disease, this might be a strong assumption in the design of
a solution, as it involves scarce annotations that might contain
strong human bias. The current leading supervised model for
COVID, COVID-Net [9], has reported promising results with
a sensitivity of 91% for COVID-19. Hence there is still plenty
of room for improvements, namely on how to use the vast
amount of available unlabelled data to prevent labelling errors
and uncertainties from affecting the classification output.
Motivated by the above limitations in current techniques, we
address the following problem – Can one get a robust classifier

2

with performance higher or comparable to the current leading
supervised technique for COVID-19 using far less labels? To
answer to this question we propose a deep semi-supervised
framework to go beyond human bias and the limited amount of
labelled data. We remark that many deep SSL techniques e.g.
[17]–[20], have only been considered for natural images. No
work has evaluated the performance outside this domain, by
considering the fundamental differences between natural and
medical images [21]. This paper extends our work in [22] with
noticeable differences. Firstly, we construct the graph based on
the initial embeddings coming from a deep net, making for an
accurate first construction. Secondly, we use our optimisation
diffusion model as means for generating pseudo-labels that
can be updated iteratively in a trained deep net. Moreover,
unlike the pseudo-label perspective of [23], our technique is a
graph based approach and the pseudo-labels are computed by
our diffusion model rather than the network. Our contributions
are as follows:
• We propose a deep semi-supervised framework, in which
we highlight:
– An optimisation model with strong class priors for
multi-class graph diffusion, which is based on normalised and non-smooth p = 1 Dirichlet energy. Our
method offers theoretical guarantees and efficient
solving.
– The connection of our diffusion model to the generation of meaningful pseudo-labels, which avoids
the current SSL trend on the use of consistency
regularisation.
We show that our framework reinforces the natural relation among the tiny labelled set and the vast unlabelled
data.
• We evaluate our technique with several numerical, statistical and visual results using an unified dataset that
contains highly diverse samples from different sources.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first graph based
deep semi-supervised technique proposed for identifying
COVID-19. Moreover, we also report explainable results
from our prediction scores to assist and accelerate the
radiologist diagnosis.
• We demonstrate that our technique reports higher sensitivity in COVID-19 and global performance than the
current leading deep supervised technique for such application whilst requiring far less labelled data.
II. R ELATED W ORK
The recent problem of classifying CXRs for COVID-19 has
observed a fast growing in the literature. Existing techniques
are reviewed in this section.
A. Chest X-ray Classification for COVID-19
The task of classifying CXRs has been widely investigated
in the community. The go-to paradigm to address this problem
is deep learning [24], [25], [25], [26]. The fast development
of these techniques has been motivated by the release of
several benchmarking datasets including ChestXray14 [24]

and CheXpert [27], in which a large number of annotated
samples from different pathologies (classes) are contained in
each dataset. With new diseases such as COVID-19, where
the annotated data is limited, one needs to rethink the whole
design of the techniques. In this work, we motivate the power
of semi-supervised learning for COVID-19. In what follows,
we review related COVID-19 and SSL techniques.
The bulk of literature addressing the task of classifying
CXRs for COVID-19 is largely based on deep supervised
learning e.g. [9], [12]–[16], [28], and several techniques arise
every single day. Most of approaches apply pre-trained off-theshelf networks; in which diverse generic architectures, including ResNet [29], DenseNet [30] and VGG [31]. Existing works
thus leverage on fine tuned networks and networks trained
from scratch on CXRs data. However, there are fundamental
differences between natural and medical image classification
including features and data size. Hence, as shown in [21],
transfer learning might offer little benefit to performance due
to the over-parameterisation of standard models. Moreover, the
samples available for COVID-19 are scarse in comparison to
other type of pneumonia, and one needs to deal with highly
imbalanced datasets.
The key assumption of supervised techniques is a wellrepresentative labelled dataset, and in new diseases, such as
COVID-19, this core assumption is a strong one. Moreover,
the available annotations might be far from being a definite
expression of ground truth [32]. Therefore, by using deep
supervised learning techniques are prone to labelling error
and uncertainty that adversely affect the classification output.
Although transfer learning [33] and Generative Adversarial
Networks [34] mitigate, at some level, the lack of a large and
representative dataset, they weakly account for the mismatch
between expert annotation and ground truth annotation, which
is generated by human bias and uncertainty, and the performance can be limited due to the differences among datasets
as demonstrated in [21].
Motivated by the above-mentioned drawbacks in deep supervised learning and with the goal of generating a high
sensitivity technique that largely decrease the need for large
annotation set, we introduce a deep semi-supervised technique
for the application to COVID-19 identification, which to our
knowledge it is the first in its type. In the next subsection we
discuss recent techniques in deep SSL for other domains and
how they differ to ours.
B. Semi-Supervised Classification for Medical Images
Semi-supervised learning has been applied in the medical
domain since its early developments, in which model based
techniques have been the main focus of attention e.g. [35]–
[39]. These approaches have demonstrated the potential of
SSL- but the generalisation of the feature space along with
the computational requirements have raised limitations. Recently, with the advent of deep learning, deep semi-supervised
learning has been investigated.
In the past few years, there has been a silent revolution
in deep SSL techniques, e.g. [18]–[20], that have sought
to combine the theoretical underpinning of SSL [40] with

the generalisation and feature extraction of deep neural networks. The largest trend for new deep SSL methods involves
consistency regularisation [17]–[20]. The core idea of this
perspective is to, for both labelled and unlabelled examples,
induce perturbations δ and then add a regularisation term to the
loss function such that the prediction of the model is invariant
to the perturbation, i.e. f (x + δ) = f (x). The main variety
between approaches stem from how to generate perturbations
δ. The definition of perturbations is indeed a complex problem,
and no work has ever evaluated the performance of consistency
based approaches outside the natural image domain.
To the best of our knowledge, there has been no deep
SSL approach proposed for COVID-19 analysis. The potential
performance of SSL has nevertheless been shown in our prior
work [22] on CXRs analysis. We readily competed with SOTA
supervised techniques for identification of several pathologies
in CXRs, using a small fraction of the available labels. In this
work, we extend this framework to build upon the concept of
pseudo-labels, first introduced in [23]. However, compared to
that initial work, there are now several key differences since a
graph based approach is considered and the pseudo-labels are
predicted from our diffusion model rather than the deep net.
III. G RAPH X-COVID F RAMEWORK
This section presents the three parts of our proposed technique: i) data representation and robust graph construction,
ii) optimisation model for graph diffusion and iii) driving
optimisation that connects our diffusion model with deep nets.
The overview of our GraphXCOVID is illustrated in Fig. 1.
Problem Definition. Given a small amount of labelled data
DL = {(xh , yh )}lh=1 with provided labels L = {1, .., L}
and yh ∈ L, and a large amount of unlabelled data Xu =
{xk }nm=l+1 . The whole set of data is thus X = XL ∪ XU ,
where XL = {x1 , ..., xl }. We seek to infer a function
f : X n 7→ Y n such that f gets a good estimate for {xk }nm=l+1
with minimum generalisation error.

In particular, in a deep semi-supervised setting, one seeks
to minimise a functional of the form:
labelled set

min
θ

z X
(x,y)∈DL

unlabelled set

}|
{
{
zX }|
LS (x, y; θ) + γ
LU (x; θ),

(1)

x∈Xu

where LS is the per example loss for the labelled set (e.g.
standard cross-entropy) and LU denotes a loss defined on the
unlabelled set (e.g. consistency loss). Moreover, γ ∈ R+ is a
weighting parameter to balance the two terms, and θ is the
network parameters to estimate.
The current go-to perspective in deep SSL is to apply
consistency regularisation for LU in (1), which enforces invariant network predictions with respect to perturbations on
the unlabelled data Xu , e.g. [17]–[20] However, the definition
of such δ-pertubations, e.g. flip-and-shift, rotate, posterise and
sharpness, is not trivial. In this work, we avoid the explicit
definition of such δ by taking a proxy-based perspective. In
particular, we rely on the concept of pseudo-labels [23] ŷi for
images of the unlabelled set xi ∈ Xu . In this work, the pseudolabels are generated by optimising our graph-based model. Our
framework is an iterative two-part technique, the first part concerns pseudo-label generation, including graph representation
(see Subsection A) and label diffusion (Subsection B). The
second step deals with the update of the generated pseudolabels (Subsection C).
A. Feature Extraction & Graph Construction
The most common data representation is a Euclidean or
grid-like structure. We rather define our data in a nonEuclidean domain with a graph. This framework offers different benefits including mathematical properties such as sparseness which allows for fast computation, and the ability to
correct initially mislabelled data by smoothing the embeddings. We represent the dataset X as a graph, where each
node is an image, to produce pseudo-labels. Then, unlike pure
model-based approaches or pure deep learning techniques, we

4

examples. For each image, our method also assigns a score
reflecting the uncertainty of the produced pseudo-label (see
subsection C). To do this, we first generate the pseudo-labels
through an optimisation model based on the normalised graph
p-Dirichlet energy expressed as:

introduce a hybrid model – that is, a combination between a
model-based (energy model) and a deep learning framework.
A deep network fθ is considered for updating the pseudolabels generated by our optimisation model. It is initialised
from the tiny labelled set (x, y) ∼ DL by minimising:
LS (XL , YL ; θ) :=

l
X

`H (fθ (xh ), yh ),

(2)

h=1

where the loss function `H is cross entropy, which is the most
common choice for classification tasks. This optimisation process only involves the provided small labelled set to construct
the initial graph (i.e. it is run once as initialisation).
More precisely, a given set of data (or features) can be
represented as an undirected weighted graph by G = (V, E, W)
composed of n nodes V = {v1 , ..., vn }, which are connected
by edges E = {{vi , vj } : vi , vj ∈ V} with weights wij =
S(i, j) ≥ 0 that correspond to some similarity measure S
between the features of nodes i ∈ V and j ∈ V, and wij = 0
if (i, j) ∈
/ E. In our setting, a node vi represents an image
of the set xi ∈ X. A fundamental question when using graph
based approaches is how to effectively extract representative
features to construct a robust graph. In order to avoid the
sensitive task of hand-crafted feature selection, we rely on
embeddings automatically produced by (2). Hence we reduce
the potentially large generalisation error that appear when
extracting features on a small training set XL .
We consider as feature extractor the function ϕθ : X → RP ,
given by the bottleneck of the current network fθ , that maps
the input to some feature space of dimension P . To construct
our graph, we compute, for each sample, the set of descriptors
by ci = ϕθ (xi ) ∈ RP for xi ∈ X, and connections are created
through the k nearest neighbours (k-NN) approach in RP . An
illustration of extracted features is given in Fig. 2.
Notice that the model fθ and the feature extractor ϕθ are
updated (subsection C) through the exposition to pseudo-labels
of unlabelled data. The graph thus evolves along our process.
We now detail how pseudo-labels are obtained on the graph
by following a transductive strategy.
B. Label Diffusion as Pseudo-Labelling
Pseudo-labels are estimated through a diffusion process
on the whole graph containing both labeled and unlabelled

(3)
where the degree of the node i is denoted by di , and the
weights are computed from the descriptors described in previous section. The minimisation of this energy allows the
diffusion of a labelling variable u. Whilst techniques in this
line have been reported in the medical domain e.g. [36], [37],
[41] and in the pure machine learning community e.g. [42],
[43], they only seek to use eigenfunctions of a normalised
Dirichlet energy based on the graph Laplacian for p = 2 or
only approximate p → 1. However, latter machine learning
works [44] has demonstrated that using the non smooth p = 1
Dirichlet energy (related to total variation) achieves better
performance for label propagation.
With this motivation in mind, we introduce an optimisation
model based on the normalised and non smooth p = 1 Dirichlet energy. Model (3) is thus defined as ∆1 (u) = |W D−1 u|,
where D is the diagonal matrix containing the degrees di and
the m × n matrix W encodes the m edges in the graph. Each
of these edges is represented on a different line i of the matrix
W , with the value wij (resp. −wij ) on the column i (resp. j).
We now detail our multi-class model that will be applied to
L = 3 classes: 0: Healthy, 1: Pneumonia and 2: COVID-19.
For each class k = 1 · · · L, we set a variable uk that contains
the node values for class k and denote u = [u1 , · · · uL ]. For
unlabelled nodes
PL i k> l, we couple the L variables with the
constraint:
k=1 ui = 0, ∀i > l. We make the standard
assumption that there exists a non empty set of labelled nodes
Ik ⊂ {1 · · · l} for each class k. For these nodes, we set uki ≥ 
0
if i ∈ Ik (positive response for the class), and uki ≤ − if
i ∈ Ik and k 0 6= k (negative output for the other classes).
Under such constraints, we seek to minimise the multi-class
functional [45] that contains the sum of normalised ratios :

where t is a time index associated to the step ∆t > 0. This
process diffuses information from labelled nodes to unlabelled
ones. To avoid trivial solutions [46], [47], we apply shifting
uk,(t+1) = uk,(t+1) − median(uk,(t+1) ) and normalisation
u(t+1) = u(t+1) /||u(t+1) || steps at the end of each iteration.
From (5), one can see that the solution uk,(t+1) satisfies:

(6)

so that we get a reduction of the normalised ratio
∆1 (uk,(t) )/|uk,(t) | along iterations k. When L = 1, the
scheme uk,(t) converges to a bivalued function that naturally
segments the graph [47]. Note that the same behaviour is
observed when L > 1, but we can only guarantee the
decrease of (6), without considering more computationally
expensive schemes [48]. Once uk has converged to some
u∗ = [u∗,1 , · · · , u∗,L ], he label of each node is finally given
by ybi = argmaxj u∗,j
i . In practice, our model (5) is solved
using an accelerated primal dual algorithm [49]. Our generated
pseudo-labels are denoted YbU = {b
yk }nk=l+1 and used to update
the classification network fθ as explained in the next section.
Notice that, unlike [23] where the pseudo-labels are inferred
from a given deep net, we compute them from our optimisation
model through label diffusion.
C. Deep Graph Pseudo-Labelling Update
Although our graph diffusion model (5) generates relevant
pseudo-labels [22], one can further decrease the uncertainty
over time. This can be achieved if we consider the two major
bottlenecks in real-world problems. A first prevalent issue in
the medical domain is to face highly imbalanced class samples.
As illustrated in Fig. 3, this is particularly true in the COVIDx
dataset. The second one is to deal with inferred pseudo-labels
with different levels of uncertainty. As it has been shown in
several works e.g. [50]–[53], these problems can be mitigated
by weighting the importance over the inferred pseudo-labels
and the classes.
The problem of classifying with a highly imbalanced dataset
has been widely studied in the literature, e.g. [50], [54]. We
apply a common strategy for imbalanced class population [50],
[55] and add a weighting factor inversely proportional to the
effective number of samples for class k : ωk ∝ 1/En , n ∈ Z>0
where En is the total number of samples. For the second problem, we associate an uncertainty weighing factor, υi , to each
uŷi generated in the diffusion process. We use entropy as the
measure for uncertainty, given by υi = 1 − (H(uŷi )/ log(L)),
where H refers to the entropy and uŷi is normalised beforehand with respect to the values in u∗i .
We finally define the main driving optimisation (i.e. estimation of network parameters) as:
min

n

υi ωybi `H (fθ (xi ), ybi ),

(7)
the loss in (7) is connected with model (1) but unlike the
typical consistency loss, for LU , we are using the philosophy
of pseudo-labels which are generated by our diffusion model.

several challenges due to the highly imbalanced classes, in which COVID-19
samples are significantly less than the Pneumonia and Healthy classes.

Let us summarise the overall process. We first optimise (2)
for a set of epochs, this serves for extracting the embeddings
from the deep net to construct a graph. We then perform
(5) to diffuse the small labelled set to the unlabelled data.
The output of this process is the generation of pseudo-labels
for the unlabelled set. These pseudo-labels are then used to
optimise (7), which in turn updates the model parameters. The
whole process (feature extraction, graph update, pseudo label
diffusion, network update) is then iterated.
IV. E XPERIMENTAL R ESULTS
In this section, we detail the set of experiments conducted
to validate our technique.
A. Dataset Description
We evaluate our approach on the COVIDx Dataset which
was introduced in [9]. The dataset is composed of a total
of 15,254 CXR images. The official partition only considers
13,975 CXR images across 13,870 patients, with a training
set composed of 13,675 images and a test test of 300 (1579
for the test set on the full dataset). This dataset is, up to our
knowledge, the largest and most diverse one for COVID-19.
COVIDx indeed merges five different datasets repositories:
COVID-19 image data collection [8], Actualmed COVID-19
Chest X-ray Dataset Initiative [56], COVID-19 Chest X-ray
Dataset Initiative [57], RSNA Pneumonia Challenge dataset
[24], [58] and COVID-19 Radiography Database [59].
The COVIDx dataset conatin thress classes: Healthy, Pneumonia and COVID-19. The class breakdown, for the full and
official partition CXR images, is illustrated in Fig. 3. As it
can be observed from these plots, it is a highly imbalanced
dataset, in which COVID-19 samples are much smaller than
for the other other two classes.

B. Evaluation Methodology & Implementation Details
We validate our proposed technique as follows. First we
evaluate the performance of our approach compared to supervised techniques including the leading fully supervised paper
in the field COVID-Net [9]. These comparisons include VGG16 [31], ResNet-18 and ResNet-50 [29], InceptionV3 [60]
and DenseNet-121 [30]. The selection of these architectures
follows the same line of motivation as in [9]: they offer a
clear advantage for dealing with the unique traits of COVID.
Our experiments are then conducted using: i) the official
partition, in which the test set is 300 samples split evenly
across the classes; ii) the full COVIDx dataset, in which
the main differences with respect i) is that the test set is
composed of 1,579 samples (see Fig. 3); and iii) an additional
random partition. We ran all the experiments under the same
conditions, and followed standard pre-processing protocol to
normalise the images to have zero mean and unit variance.
The images we resized to the resolution 480×480.
The evaluation is addressed from both qualitative and quantitative points of view. The former is based on visual outputs of
our classification. The latter present the per class computation
of sensitivity, positive predictive value and F1-scores. The
overall performance is computed in terms of accuracy and
error rate. Furthermore, for sake of completeness and guided
by the field of estimation statistics, we report along with the
error rate the confidence intervals (95%) of all techniques.
Finally, we performed a data ablation study of our SSL method
by using 10%, 20% and 30% of labels.
We now give implementation details. For the COVIDNet [9] technique, we used the implementation and parameters
provided by the authors. In particular, we considered the

latest suggested model COVIDNet-CXR3-B. For the compared
techniques, we used weight decay= 5e-4, momentum= 0.9
and learning rate 1e-2 (1e-3 for [23], and ResNet-18 for a
fair comparison). For our technique, the k-NN neighborhood
graph has been built with k = 50. A ResNet-18 architecture
has been used for the deep network fθ . In practice, we used
a total number of epochs of 210 with and a weight decay of
2 × 10−4 and learning rate was set to 5e-2 decreasing with
cosine annealing. Furthermore, we follow standard protocol in
semi-supervised learning to report our results, we randomly
select the labelled samples over five repeated times, that isone has five different splits. We then report the mean error
over the splits. All techniques were implemented in PyTorch
and using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) as optimiser.
C. Results & Discussion
We begin by evaluating the different methods on the
official COVIDx partition. As a baseline comparison, we

consider six supervised techniques: VGG-16 [31], ResNet18 and ResNet-50 [29], InceptionV3 [60], DenseNet-121 [30]
and COVID-Net [9]. To the best of our knowledge, there
exists no semi-supervised technique dedicated to COVID19 identification that we can compare. Hence, for the sake
of fairness, we also adapted one semi-supervised technique,
Pseudo-Labelling [23], that has a philosophy close to ours.
The supervised methods use the full training set, whereas the
SSL techniques only consider 30% of the labelled set.
We provide a detailed quantitative analysis to understand
the performance of the different techniques. The per class
metrics across the official data partition are thus reported
in Table I. Concerning positive predictive values, we observe that our GraphXCOVID approach performs the best for
healthy and pneumonia classes and it readily competes with
COVID-Net in the COVID-19 class. Due to design limitations,
VGG-16 performed the worst, whereas ResNet-50 presents
performances closer to GraphXCOVID thanks to its residual
architecture. We also observe that excepting for the COVID-19
class, InceptionV3 and DenseNet-121 both sightly outperform
ResNet-50. In order to show the robustness of our technique,
we also considered the full COVIDx dataset, a scenario closer
to a real medical setting. We compared our method with
the supervised approach of COVID-Net, the second better
method on the official partition. As reported in Table II,
GraphXCOVID here performs better for all classes and all
considered metrics, while only using 30% of the labelled set.
The second evaluation is done in terms of sensitivity. As
shown in tables I and II, GraphXCOVID reports the highest
values for pneumonia and COVID-19. For COVID-19, the
true positive proportion is significantly higher for our method
(0.94) and COVID-Net (0.92) than for other ones (≤0.88).

Fig. 5. From top to bottom. Error rate comparison (95%CI) of our technique
using different label set counts. Error rate vs epochs (i.e iterative process
displayed at the center part of Fig. 1) using 30% of labels.

This observation is confirmed with the sensitivity results on
the highly imbalanced full dataset (see Table II).
To give a view of the relative performance of all techniques,
the F1-scores are respectively reported in Tables I and II for
the official and full partitions. It still underlines that VGG-16,
ResNet-50, DenseNet-121 and InceptionV3 are not sufficiently
competitive, whereas COVID-Net and our GraphXCOVID
technique are readily performing in a similar level. However,
looking deeper into the performance of these two last techniques, we observe that within a highly imbalanced scenario
(see Table II), our approach outperforms COVID-Net.
We also compare our technique to a SSL technique, with
similar philosophy than ours but different in design, PseudoLabelling [23]. This technique generates the pseudo-labels
directly from the network whilst our approach considers labels
coming from the diffusion model. From Table I, one can observe that G RAPH XCOVID offers a substantial improvement
over Pseudo-Labelling for all metrics. Overall, we achieve
better accuracy with an improvement of 8%, and reduce the
error rate (±1.20CI) by more than half as displayed in Fig
4. The improvement comes from two parts. The first major
benefit is related to pseudo-labels generation. The work of [23]
provides naive pseudo-labels with the network itself, while
our technique generates more certain ones that are iteratively
updated using both our diffusion models and the network,
along with a uncertainty weight. Secondly, our technique also
accounts for imbalanced class distribution.
To further support the previous results and give a global
performance view, we compute the error rate and the confidence intervals for each model. The results are reported in
Fig. 4 for the official and a random partition of this set. For
both experiments, VGG-16 reported the worst performance
followed by ResNet-18. Our model performed the best among
all the compared models, reporting an error of 5.4 ± 1.1 at the
95% confidence level. As for the other criteria, COVID-Net
ranked second, reporting an error of the model of 6.7±1.23 at
the 95% confidence level. One can also observe from the top
of Fig. 4 that supervised techniques are highly variable at the

that the model has clearly separated normal x-rays from injected x-rays as well as distinguished between pneumonia and COVID-19.

change of partition. Such approaches are indeed heavily reliant
on the training set being well-representative and balance. In
comparison, the variation is negligible with our SSL approach.
In order to analyse the robustness of our model, we run
an ablation study for different label counts. In Fig. 5 (top),
we present the error rates and confidence intervals obtained
by GraphXCOVID with 10%, 20% and 30% of the available
labels. Why do not increase the percentage of labels? First, we
want to use the lowest possible number of labels. Secondly, we
seek to keep the advantage of transductive inference. Indeed,
as pointed out in early works e.g. [61], the benefit of a
transductive model is decreased when a large number of labels
is considered. This effect was observed in our experiments. We
finally illustrate in Fig. 5 (bottom), the behaviour of our model
along iterations. Around 200 epochs were required to reach a
stable error rate when considering 30% of labels.
A visual illustration of the result is next provided in Fig. 6,
where the probability scores of our technique are reported and

compared with the human prediction (GT). One can see that
the obtained classifier fθ easily differentiate between classes.
However, the probability scores (from Fig. 6) are not enough to
assist the radiologist in making the decision. To accommodate
with this issue, we use a Gradient-weighted Class Activation
Mapping [62] type solution to highlight abnormal and normal
areas in the lungs, in which Pneumonia and COVID-19 are
linked to abnormally regions. Samples outputs of the attention
maps are displayed in Fig. 7 and compared with the human
prediction (GT). The attention maps aims to accommodate
with the mental model on how the radiologists work in a
clinical scenario. Therefore, we project the attention only in
the lungs areas. This tool is designed to help, in a friendly
user-interface, the radiologist judging whether the diagnostic
is correct or not, and in consequence to accelerate the decision.
From the aforementioned findings, we emphasise a central
message: the strong performance when using far less labelled
data than the compared techniques is a core strength of our

V. C ONCLUSION
In this work, we propose a graph-based deep semisupervised framework for classifying COVID-19 Chext X-ray
images based on an optimisation model for label diffusion.
Through the minimisation of a normalised and non-smooth
p = 1 Dirichlet energy, the model generates meaningful
pseudo-labels that are iteratively used to update a deep
net. To our knowledge, this is the first graph based deep
semi-supervised technique for COVID-19 analysis. From our
results, we demonstrated that our technique reports higher
sensitivity in COVID-19 and better global performances than
the current leading deep supervised technique, while requiring
a very reduced set of labels. We also provide attention maps
as means to visualise the output of our technique. These
visualisation aims to assist the radiologist in judging whether
the diagnosis is correct. With this work, we encourage a
new line of research on deep semi-supervised learning for
novel disease prediction, as for COVID-19. Such approaches
alleviate the need for a large labelled dataset, which is costly
and time consuming to produce especially for emerging pan-
