ABSTRACT
Disinformation campaigns on social media, involving coordinated
activities from malicious accounts towards manipulating public
opinion, have become increasingly prevalent. Existing approaches
to detect coordinated accounts either make very strict assumptions
about coordinated behaviours, or require part of the malicious accounts in the coordinated group to be revealed in order to detect the
rest. To address these drawbacks, we propose a generative model,
AMDN-HAGE (Attentive Mixture Density Network with Hidden
Account Group Estimation) which jointly models account activities
and hidden group behaviours based on Temporal Point Processes
(TPP) and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), to capture inherent
characteristics of coordination which is, accounts that coordinate
must strongly influence each other’s activities, and collectively appear anomalous from normal accounts. To address the challenges of
optimizing the proposed model, we provide a bilevel optimization
algorithm with theoretical guarantee on convergence. We verified
the effectiveness of the proposed method and training algorithm
on real-world social network data collected from Twitter related
to coordinated campaigns from Russia’s Internet Research Agency
targeting the 2016 U.S. Presidential Elections, and to identify coordinated campaigns related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Leveraging
the learned model, we find that the average influence between coordinated account pairs is the highest. On COVID-19, we found
coordinated group spreading anti-vaccination, anti-masks conspiracies that suggest the pandemic is a hoax and political scam.

In recent times, the persistent abuse of social media for spreading disinformation and influencing public opinion and social outcomes has become an increasingly pressing problem [20]. It has
largely been used as a tactic to influence elections [2], public perception on social issues such as social distancing policies related
to COVID-19 [21] and other local and global events. The issue has
gained even more relevance during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, where increased reliance on social media for information
related to healthcare and policies, has made it an easy target for
large-scale disinformation campaigns [21]. The earliest reported
cases of disinformation campaigns surfaced when investigations
by the U.S. congress found coordinated accounts operated by Russia’s “Internet Research Agency” (IRA) or Russian “troll farm" on
social media to influence the 2016 U.S. Election by promotion of

INTRODUCTION

Woodstock ’18, June 03–05, 2018, Woodstock, NY

disinformation, and politically divisive narratives [2]. Identification
of coordinated accounts used to manipulate social media is critical.
To address this crucial task, earlier approaches have tried to
uncover coordinated accounts based on their individual behaviours,
from account features and participation in disinformation promotion [1], or collective group behaviours, such as activities synchronized in time [4, 17]. However, they all face inherent limitations. The
methods relying on disinformation cues or automated behaviours
to detect coordinated actors fall short in detecting human operated
accounts that instead use persuasion, defamation, and polarization to manipulate opinions (characteristics noted in coordinated
influence operations [13]).
Existing methods exploiting collective behaviours heavily rely
on assumed features of coordinated behaviour e.g. similar sequence
of hashtags as coordination signature or activities synchronized in
time [17, 24, 28]. However such features can be inconsistent [30],
limiting generalization to unseen accounts. Moreover, reliance on
hand-crafted coordination signatures can only capture a limited
range of behaviours, and are ineffective at reducing false positives,
making strict assumptions on coordinated groups which need not
hold true. Fig. 1 shows an example of accounts officially suspended
by Twitter and their activities observed in COVID-19 data (also
identified as coordinated with our method). The time differences of
coordinated activities observed from the accounts is diverse, with
less than 6 hours in one case to more than half a week in another.
In this work, to address these shortcomings we propose to model
the following inherent characteristics of coordination:
• Strong hidden influence. If accounts coordinate to amplify
social media posts or target specific individuals, there should
be a strong hidden (latent) influence between their activities.
Significant recent computational propaganda is produced
and operated by political operatives and governments [25].
• Highly concerted activities. The collective behaviours of
coordinated accounts should be collectively anomalous, from
other normal accounts on the network with less organized
activity patterns (i.e., observations that deviate from normal
when generated by a different mechanism [10]).
To capture them, we propose AMDN-HAGE (Attentive Mixture
Density Network with Hidden Account Group Estimation),
an unsupervised generative model for identification of coordinated
accounts, which jointly models account activities and hidden account groups based on Neural Temporal Point Processes (NTPP) and
Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). To learn the latent interactions
or influence between account activities, we model the distribution
of future activities conditioned on past activities of all accounts
with temporal differences, and jointly capture collective anomalous
behaviour by simultaneously learning the group membership of
accounts. To address the joint optimization, we propose a bilevel
optimization algorithm using both stochastic gradient descent and
expectation-maximization, from observed activity traces.
As AMDN-HAGE directly learns account representations and
hidden groups from activity traces with only account ids and activity timestamps in an unsupervised manner, it does not require
knowledge of partially uncovered accounts in coordinated groups,
or predefined individual features, although they can also be plugged

in easily if necessary. Furthermore, unlike the existing models relying on strict group behaviour hypothesises like timestamp synchronization, our model only assumes that coordinated accounts are
an anomalous group with concerted activities, allowing more datadriven identification of coordinated groups. In addition to above
advantages on effectiveness, by incorporating an explicit attention
module, we enable our model to learn and output the strength of
latent interactions between accounts on the network. In general,
our contributions are the following,
• We propose AMDN-HAGE to detect coordinated campaigns
from collective group behaviours inferred from account activities based on NTTP and GMM.
• We provide a bilevel optimization algorithm for joint learning of activity trace modeling (NTPP) and social group modeling (GMM) with theoretical and empirical guarantee.
• Extensive experiments on real-world Twitter data about
known coordinated campaign verify our method is highly
effective on coordination detection. From learned model we
find identifiable patterns of coordinated accounts such as
the influence between them is highest but also decay fastest.
• We apply the method to identify unknown coordinated campaigns in COVID-19 data, and find coordinated group of
Spanish and English accounts (NoMask, NoVaccine, NoALaVacuna, NoAlNuevoOrdenMundia, QAnon) about no masks,
no vaccine, no new world order conspiracies, opposing Bill
Gates, that suggest COVID-19 is a hoax and political scam.

RELATED WORK

The problem of disinformation and social media abuse has reduced
trust in online platforms. Efforts to combat false and misleading information have been widely studied in many different contexts [20]
ranging from detection of false information from content features
and the responses to it on social media, to understanding the diffusion patterns [19] and accounts involved in its spread [7]. Different
from social bots and individual malicious accounts, a growing area
of research is the detection of coordinated accounts (coordinated
disinformation or influence campaigns), also called “troll farms",
orchestrated by group of human and/or bot accounts that are made
to work jointly to promote disinformation or other narratives [12].
The main techniques to identify coordinated accounts are:
Individual behaviours. Existing works mainly uses two kinds
of individual behaviours. The first one is the participation in disinformation spreading [18, 19]. For instance, Ruchansky et al. propose
a fake news detection model that assigns a suspiciousness score to
accounts based on their participation in fake news cascades [18].
The second kind are individual characteristics such as deceptive
linguistic features, number of shared links, hashtags and device of
posting and cross-platform activity [1, 11, 29]. Apart from above
pre-defined features, the activity traces of troll accounts have been
found useful for understanding malicious behaviours. In recent
work, the tweet, retweet and reply patterns of Twitter accounts are
utilized to infer the incentives or rewards behind their activities, formulated as an inverse reinforcement learning problem [12]. Based
on the estimated rewards, the authors found that the behaviours of
trolls was different from regular users as they appeared to perform
their activity regardless of the responses.

Identifying Coordinated Accounts on Social Media through Hidden Influence and Group Behaviours

Collective behaviours. Approaches that examine the collective or group behaviours as a whole to detect anomalous malicious
accounts are related to our approach. Cao et al. and Gupta et al.
cluster accounts that take similar actions around the same time,
based on the assumption that malicious account activities are synchronized in time [4, 9]. Other works cluster or partition a account
similarity graph defined over hand-crafted features assumed to be
indicative of coordinated behaviours, including the sequence of
hashtags or articles shared collectively by a large group of accounts
[17, 24]. The significant limitation of such approaches is that the
assumption on synchronization or hand-crafted features used to
define coordination might not hold. In contrast, we propose to automatically learn and detect coordinated behaviours from observed
account activities by learning the latent account interactions.

3 TASK DEFINITION AND PRELIMINARIES
3.1 Task Definition
In this section, we introduce the task of detecting coordinated
accounts in social networks from collective group behaviours of the
accounts. Coordinated campaigns are orchestrated efforts where
accounts collude to inorganically spread and amplify the spread
of specific narratives for opinion manipulation, and the task we
address is to identify such coordinated accounts.
In this work, we propose AMDN-HAGE (Attentive Mixture Density Network with Hidden Account Group Estimation), an unsupervised generative model for coordination detection. It jointly models
account activity traces and latent account groups, to learn collective group behaviours from observed account activities, and detect
coordinated accounts with collective anomalous behaviours.
Activity traces: The only input we consider are the activity
traces of accounts on the social network. An activity trace can be
represented as a sequence of events ordered in time, which can
be formulated as 𝐶𝑠 = [(𝑢 1, 𝑡 1 ), (𝑢 2, 𝑡 2 ), (𝑢 3, 𝑡 3 ), · · · (𝑢𝑛 , 𝑡𝑛 )]. Each
tuple (𝑢𝑖 , 𝑡𝑖 ) corresponds to an activity by account 𝑢𝑖 at time 𝑡𝑖 . The
activities represent account actions on the network such as posting
original content, re-sharing, replying, or reacting to other posts.
In order to provide platform/language independent detection,
we do not include the type of action, or features such as content
of the post, and account metadata, although additional available
features can be easily incorporated in the method. The basic input
is the most easily available for any social network. Furthermore,
the only assumption we make on the coordinated campaign is that:
• Compared to normal accounts, the number of coordinated
accounts is quite small (i.e., collectively anomalous).
• Coordinated users have highly concerted activity patterns
Hidden Account Group: In real social networks, accounts with
similar activities form social groups, that can constitute normal
communities as well as coordinated groups. Supposing that there
are 𝑁 groups in the account set 𝑈 , we can define a membership
function 𝑀 : 𝑈 → {1, · · · , 𝑁 }, which projects each account 𝑢𝑖 to its
group index. This membership in many cases is hidden or unknown
[3]. Acquiring 𝑀 can help us identify collective anomalous group
behaviours to detect coordinated groups. In this work, we aim to
learn the hidden groups from only the observed activity traces.

Temporal Point Process

A temporal point process (TPP) is a stochastic process whose realization is a sequence of discrete events in continuous time 𝑡 ∈ R+
[5]. The history of events in the sequence up to time 𝑡 are generally
denoted as 𝐻𝑡 = {(𝑢𝑖 , 𝑡𝑖 )|𝑡𝑖 < 𝑡, 𝑢𝑖 ∈ U} where U represents the
set of event types (here, accounts). The conditional intensity function 𝜆(𝑡 |𝐻𝑡 ) of a point process is defined as the instantaneous rate
of an event in an infinitesimal window at time 𝑡 given the history
i.e. 𝜆(𝑡 |𝐻𝑡 )𝑑𝑡 = E[𝑑𝑁 (𝑡)|𝐻𝑡 ] where 𝑁 (𝑡) is the number of events
up to time 𝑡. The conditional density function of the 𝑖 th event can
be derived from the conditional intensity [6] as
 ∫ 𝑡

𝑝 (𝑡 |𝐻𝑡 ) = 𝜆(𝑡 |𝐻𝑡 ) exp −
𝜆(𝑠 |𝐻𝑡 )𝑑𝑠
(1)
𝑡𝑖−1

In social network data, the widely used formulation of the conditional intensity is the multivariate Hawkes Process (HP) [32],
Í
defined as 𝜆𝑖 (𝑡 |𝐻𝑡 ) = 𝜇𝑖 + 𝑡 𝑗 <𝑡 𝛼𝑖,𝑗 𝜅 (𝑡 − 𝑡 𝑗 ), where 𝜆𝑖 (𝑡 |𝐻𝑡 ) is the
conditional intensity of event type 𝑖 at time 𝑡 with base intensity
𝜇𝑖 > 0 and mutually triggering intensity 𝛼𝑖,𝑗 > 0 capturing the
influence of event type 𝑗 on 𝑖 and 𝜅 is a decay kernel to model influence decay over time. 𝜇 and 𝛼 are learnable parameters. Since HP’s
fixed formulation and few learnable parameters limit its expressive
power, recent works propose to model the intensity function with
neural networks [6, 14, 16, 22, 31, 33].

COORDINATION DETECTION METHOD

In order to capture the latent influence between account’s activities,
and collective behaviours of coordinated groups, as well as diversity
in coordinated activities from such accounts, we introduce the
proposed model AMDN-HAGE.
AMDN-HAGE consists of two components: an Attentive Mixture Density Network (AMDN) that models observed activity traces
as a temporal point process and a Hidden Account Group Estimation (HAGE) component that models account groups as mixture
of multiple distributions. An overview is shown in Figure 2. The
two components share the account embedding layer and reflect the
complete generative process that the accounts are first drawn from
multiple hidden groups and then interact with each other so that
activity traces are observed. Using the observed activity traces, we
can learn the generative model by maximizing the likelihood function of the joint model, and acquire not only account embeddings
but also a activity trace model and group membership function.
Denoting the account embeddings as 𝐸, the parameters in AMDN as
𝜃 𝑎 and the parameters in HAGE as 𝜃𝑔 , the joint likelihood function
can be written as:
log 𝑝 (𝐶𝑠 , 𝑈 ; 𝜃𝑔 , 𝜃 𝑎 , 𝐸) = log 𝑝 (𝐶𝑠 |𝑈 ; 𝜃𝑔 , 𝜃 𝑎 , 𝐸) + log 𝑝 (𝑈 ; 𝜃𝑔 , 𝜃, 𝐸)
= log 𝑝 (𝐶𝑠 |𝑈 ; 𝜃 𝑎 , 𝐸) + log 𝑝 (𝑈 ; 𝜃𝑔 , 𝐸)
(2)
𝑝 (𝐶𝑠 |𝑈 ; 𝜃 𝑎 , 𝐸) is the probability density that the activity traces
are observed given a known account set, and 𝑝 (𝑈 ; 𝜃𝑔 , 𝐸) is the
probability density that we observe the account set drawn from the
latent hidden social groups. With the account embeddings and the
learned membership, we obtain collectively anomalous groups as
latent groups with anomalous distributions having small variance
or size compared to the rest of the accounts, to detect coordination.

the end, we apply layer normalization, dropout and feed-forward
layer to 𝐻𝑎𝑡𝑡𝑛 to get output 𝐻𝑜𝑢𝑡 ∈ R𝐿×𝑑 . To maintain ordering of
the history events, we represent the position information of the 𝑖-th
event as an 𝑚-dim position encoding 𝑃𝐸𝑝𝑜𝑠=𝑖 with trigonometric
integral function following [23].
Account and time encoding. We also represent account type and
time (𝑢𝑖 , 𝑡𝑖 ) using learnable account embedding matrix 𝐸 ∈ R |𝑈 |𝑥𝑚

feature maps 𝜙 with multiple periodic functions of different frequencies 𝜔 to embed inter-event times.

In this section, we introduce the AMDN component (Attentive Mixture Density Network) to model account activities for coordination
detection. AMDN consists of two parts: a history encoder and an
event decoder. Suppose we are modeling the activity (𝑢𝑖 , 𝑡𝑖 ), the history encoder represents all the activities that happened before 𝑡𝑖 as
a vector 𝐻𝑡𝑖 . Then the event decoder, which is the conditional density function, predicts (𝑢𝑖 , 𝑡𝑖 ) based on the history representation
𝐻𝑡𝑖 and the known account set. This encoder-decoder architecture
models activities with likelihood 𝑝 (𝐶𝑠 |𝑈 ; 𝜃 𝑎 , 𝐸) factorized as:
log 𝑝 (𝐶𝑠 |𝑈 ; 𝜃 𝑎 , 𝐸) =

all the above properties. We use masked self-attention [23] (with additional temporal encoding for handling irregular inter-event times)
to encode the event history for interpretable influence between past
and future events (alternative to the recurrent neural network used
in [22]), but still use a log-normal mixture distribution as event
decoder to model the conditional density of the next event given
the history (similar to [22]), achieving all properties.
Encoding event sequences with masked self-attention. Let
𝜏 ∈ R+ represent inter-event time, 𝑝 (𝜏 |𝐻𝜏 ) the conditional density.
History 𝐻𝜏 is encoded with a neural network to automatically
extract useful features, similar to other neural point process models.

The input 𝑋𝑖 (to the attention head) of
event (𝑢𝑖 , 𝑡𝑖 ), is a
concatenation of event, position and temporal embedding,

Event history context vector. The attention mechanism gives us
representations of each event using attention over events prior to it.
We can use the representation of the last event or a recurrent network layer over the attention outputs 𝐻𝑜𝑢𝑡 ∈ R𝐿𝑥𝑑 to summarize
events histories into context vectors 𝐶 ∈ R𝐿𝑥𝑑 where 𝐿 is event
sequence length. Each 𝑐𝑖 ∈ 𝐶 is a context vector encoding history
of events up to 𝑡𝑖 i.e. history 𝐻𝑡𝑖 of the temporal point process.

We provide architecture details in the following paragraphs.
4.1.1 AMDN architecture and training. In Table 1, we summarize
existing point process models (detailed in Appx.); these models suffer from different drawbacks with a trade-off on flexible intensity
function (better expressive power), closed-form likelihood (reducing gradient noise in training) and interpretable influence (explicit
influence score on event pairs). For modeling coordinated accounts,
above properties are all useful. Thus, we develop AMDN, which has

Conditional probability density function. With the encoded
event history (context vector), the event decoder (learnable conditional density function 𝑝 (𝜏 |𝐻𝜏 )) is used to generate the distribution
of the next event time conditioned on the history.
While we can choose any functional form for 𝑝 (𝜏 |𝐻𝜏 )), the only
condition is that it should be a valid PDF (non-negative, and integrate to 1 over 𝜏 ∈ R+ ). To maintain a valid PDF, exponential or
other distributions with learnable parameters are generally used
in point process models [6, 22, 32]. We define the PDF as mixture

Identifying Coordinated Accounts on Social Media through Hidden Influence and Group Behaviours

of log-normal distributions since the domain of 𝜏 ∈ R+ is nonnegative (as in [22]), and mixture distributions can approximate
any density on R arbitrarily well [22] not restricted to exponential
or other monotonic functions. The conditional PDF is defined as,

4.3

Modeling Hidden Groups

For modeling the hidden social groups from the observed activity traces, we model the hidden groups of accounts as a mixture
of 𝑁 Gaussian multivariate distributions (GMM) in the account
embedding space.
Formally, the 𝑖-th social group is modeled as a Gaussian distribution N (𝜇𝑖 , Σ𝑖 ) where 𝜇𝑖 is the cluster mean and Σ𝑖 is the covariance
matrix. Since the group membership of accounts is unknown, we assume that the account embeddings are drawn from the mixture, as
Í
embedding 𝐸𝑢 𝑗 of account 𝑢 𝑗 is distributed as 𝑖 𝑝 (𝑖)N (𝐸𝑢 𝑗 ; 𝜇𝑖 , Σ𝑖 ),
where 𝑝 (𝑖) represents prior probability of group 𝑖.
Hidden group estimation: A notable difference from general
Gaussian mixture models, is that we define the GMM over the
learnable account embeddings (latent space), as compared to over
observed variables. Therefore, the optimization and learning of
AMDN-HAGE requires bilevel optimization for jointly learning the
model parameters and account embeddings (as discussed in the next
section). The model proposed here aims to capture latent or hidden
groups from activity traces, rather than from observed account
features. This is because coordination patterns (like, activities of
coordinated accounts might strongly influence each other) remain
in activity traces and provide information about their collective
behaviours, enabling identification of coordinated hidden groups.
For modeling distinct groups of coordinated and normal accounts, we used tied covariance Σ for all groups. Denoting the
parameters (means, the shared covariance, and prior) of GMM as
𝜃𝑔 , the log-likelihood of social group modeling over accounts 𝑈 is:

Jointly Learning

For joint learning, we maximize following log-likelihood:

(11)
Above loss function has a trivial infinite asymptotic solution where
all embedding vectors equal to the mean of a cluster and det(Σ) = 0.
To avoid this solution, we constraint det(Σ) to be greater than a
small constant 𝜆, lower bounding the loss function.
The log-likelihood (Eq 11) is a function of parameters 𝜃 𝑎 , 𝜃𝑔 , 𝐸. In
this, the optimization of the second term (Gaussian mixture of the
shared latent embeddings), is a constrained optimization problem.
Therefore, directly optimizing the joint likelihood with Stochastic
Gradient Descent (SGD) or its variants like ADAM does not respect
the constraints on mixture weights (normalized non-negative) and
covariance (positive definite), leading to invalid log-likelihood in
training (ablation study of loss with ADAM is in the expt section).
To address above disadvantages, we provide an equivalent bilevel
optimization formulation to solve the joint learning problem:
𝜃 𝑎∗ , 𝐸 ∗ = argmax𝜃𝑎 ,𝐸 [log 𝑝 (𝐶𝑠 |𝑈 ; 𝜃 𝑎 , 𝐸) + max𝜃𝑔 (log 𝑝 (𝑈 ; 𝜃𝑔 , 𝐸))]
(12)
𝜃𝑔∗ = argmax𝜃𝑔 log 𝑝 (𝑈 ; 𝜃𝑔 , 𝐸 ∗ )
(13)
Above bilevel optimization can be solved with iterative optimization.
In each iteration, we first freeze 𝐸 and 𝜃 , then estimate 𝜃𝑔 with EM
algorithm. After that, we freeze 𝜃𝑔 and use SGD (or its variant) to
optimize 𝐸 and 𝜃 𝑎 . Since the log-likelihood of latent embeddings
is optimized in the second term (Eq. 11), we require initialization
of embeddings by pre-training 𝐸 and 𝜃 𝑎 on observed sequences by
maximizing the first term in the objective function, before jointly
optimizing the two terms. Detailed algorithm is in Algorithm 1.
A generic concern to such alternating optimization algorithm is
its convergence. Therefore, we give following theoretic guarantee
that the proposed algorithm leads the model to converge at least
on a local minimum or a saddle point with appropriate selection of
the gradient based optimizer (denoting 𝐿(𝜃 𝑎 , 𝐸, 𝜃𝑔 ) as the negative
log-likelihood (loss function)).

conditions can be guaranteed when our loss function is L-smooth
and we apply standard Gradient Descent Algorithm with learning
rate lower than 𝐿1 [15]. But in practice, since finding strict local
minimum is not as important as training speed and generalization,
we can alternatively apply Adam or other variants.

EXPERIMENT RESULTS

We verified the effectiveness of the proposed method AMDN-HAGE
and training algorithm on real datasets collected from Twitter related to coordinated accounts by Russia’s Internet Research Agency,
and for identification and analysis of coordination in COVID-19.
We provide data collection, baselines and model variants. Details
of implementation and experiment settings, are in the Appendix.1

5.1

Data Collection

5.1.1 Russia’s Internet Research Agency (IRA) coordinated campaign.
2752 Twitter accounts were identified by the U.S. Congress2 as coordinated accounts operated by the Russian agency (referred to
as “troll farm") to manipulate the U.S. Election in 2016. The social
media posts (activities) of subset of these accounts were available
through paid Twitter API access by the academic community to
study coordinated account detection [2, 12]. We obtained the collected dataset from Luceri et al. which contains 312 of the Russian
coordinated accounts (referred to as coordinated “trolls") with their
1.2M tweets, and also includes 1713 normal accounts that participated in discussion about the U.S. Election during which the
coordinated trolls were active (collected based on election related
keywords using Twitter API); accounts in the collected dataset were
active accounts with at least 20 active and passive tweets 3 [12].
Activity traces: Activity traces 𝐶𝑠 are constructed from the
tweets, as any account’s posts and subsequent engagements from
others (retweets, replies to the post) forming a time-ordered sequence of activities. The account set (2025 accounts) and activity
traces are utilized to train AMDN-HAGE, and a held-out 15% of
sequence subsets are used as validation loss of the model.
5.1.2 COVID-19 pandemic. Due to concerns around disinformation and social media abuse around COVID-19, we collect social
media posts from with keywords related to COVID-19, using Twitter’s streaming API service from March 1 to July 22, 2021. We use
the collected 119,298 active accounts, that have at least twenty
active and passive collected tweets, and their 13.9M tweets.
Unknown coordination: The COVID-19 data does not have
any labeled coordinated groups, unlike the IRA dataset. But it is
important to examine if we can uncover any unknown coordinated

campaigns. We run AMDN-HAGE on the full 119k account set with
their activity traces as in the IRA dataset, and examine tweets from
identified coordinated groups, and the overlap of accounts with
suspended Twitter accounts (manually suspended by Twitter for
violations of platform policies). There can be violating accounts
that have not yet been found and suspended by Twitter. Also, accounts that are suspended can be due to various reasons (e.g. spam,
automation, multiple accounts) but Twitter suspensions are not
restricted to coordinating accounts. Thus we cannot use Twitter
suspensions to estimate precision-recall on coordination detection.

5.2

Baselines and Model Variant

We compare against existing approaches that utilize account activities to identify coordinated accounts. The baselines - extract
features of coordination from account activities and use them for
supervised or unsupervised detection of coordination, based on
both individual or collective behaviours.
(1) Unsupervised Baselines: Co-activity clustering [18] and Clickstream clustering [24] are based on pre-defined activity features. Co-activity models joint activity in content sharing,
and Clickstream clustering models patterns in post, retweet
and reply actions. The SOTA approach is IRL [12] based
on inverse reinforcement learning to extract features from
activity traces, for clustering coordinated accounts.
(2) Supervised Baselines: IRL(S) [12] is sota supervised variant
of inverse reinforcement approach which trains a supervised
classifier on extracted features from activity traces (with
labeled subset of accounts).
We add another baseline using HP (Hawkes Process) [32] to
learn account features unsupervised from activity traces. HP(S) is
the supervised variant. HP models the influence between accounts
with an additive function. This baseline serves as a ablation of
the proposed model to show that latent influence and interaction
patterns for coordinated group is more complex and neural point
process can better extract these coordination features.
For ablation of different components of proposed model AMDNHAGE, we also compare with (i) AMDN (without hiden group
estimation), which only learns the activity trace model; we can
use it to extract account embeddings and cluster with GMM or
KMeans to identify the coordinated group as anomalous group. (ii)
AMDN-HAGE directly uses the jointly learnt GMM to output the
group membership. AMDN-HAGE + Kmeans instead uses account
embeddings from AMDN-HAGE with KMeans clustering to find
the anomalous coordinated group. (iii) To compare with supervised
setting (IRL (S) [12]), we similarly train a classifier on extracted
features i.e., learned account embeddings to detect coordinated
accounts (assuming subset of labeled coordinated and normal accounts are available for training). The variants are AMDN + NN
and AMDN-HAGE + NN which use a two-layer MLP classifier on
extracted embeddings from AMDN and AMDN-HAGE resp.

Results of Coordination Detection

Detection results on IRA dataset: We evaluate on two settings unsupervised and supervised (as in earlier work [12]). In both, the
the proposed model is trained as unsupervised from activity traces
to obtain the group membership and account embeddings.

In the unsupervised, the group membership is directly used to
report anomalous coordinated group. In supervised, the learned
embeddings are used as features to train a classifier (to predict
coordinated from normal accounts). The classifier is trained on
subset of labeled coordinated and normal accounts in IRA dataset,
with rest (stratified 20% in 5-folds) held-out for evaluation.
Table 2 provides results of model evaluation against the baselines averaged in 5-fold stratified cross-validation on the labeled
normal and coordinated accounts in the IRA dataset over five random seeds. We compare the Average Precision (AP), area under the
ROC curve (AUC), and F1, Precision, Recall, and MacroF1 at 0.5
threshold, and maxF1 at threshold that maximizes it. AMDN-HAGE
outperforms other methods on both unsupervised and supervised
settings, due to its ability to capture coordination characteristics
with diverse account behaviours by learning latent influence and
hidden group behaviours, without pre-specifying features relied on
by other baselines.
Moreover, the coordination features learned with the proposed
method are robust to unsupervised or supervised setting, unlike
IRL and IRL(S) [12] (where even though IRL(S) can learn useful
features, it performs poorly in unsupervised setting). In comparison,
because AMDN-HAGE models the more intrinsic behaviours of
coordination, it can extract patterns that can effectively identify
anomalous coordinated groups in an unsupervised manner. The
margin is larger on unsupervised than supervised setting, where
group behaviours are more important, since there is no known set
of coordinated accounts to train classifiers from extracted features.
Ablation of proposed model and training: Besides baselines,
we also compare AMDN-HAGE with its variants to verify the importance of the joint learning and optimization algorithm.
To verify the importance of joint learning, in Table 2, AMDNHAGE is compared with AMDN, which only learns the activity
trace model, without hidden group estimation. Proposed model
AMDN-HAGE captures consistently better coordination behaviours,
indicating that modeling group or collective behaviour jointly is
useful over only modeling the latent influence between account
pairs through observed activity trace modeling.

ing proposed algorithm.

Figure 3: Comparison of bilevel optimization and Adam.

To demonstrate the effectiveness of the bilevel training algorithm,
we present the validation loss (negative log-likelihood on held-out
15% of activity traces) in the training process, comparing direct
optimization of the joint log-likelihood using Adam (variant of SGD)
and our proposed bilevel algorithm in Fig. 3. As we can see, for the
proposed optimization, the loss on the validation set in both the
pre-training and joint training stage decline and finally converge.
However, in direct optimization with Adam the validation loss
decreases to a point but breaks as it reaches an invalid parameter
point. Without constraints, Adam reaches a covariance matrix that
is not positive definite, and an invalid log-likelihood (NaN).

Analysis of Coordination Detection

5.4.1 Uncovering characteristic behaviours from influence structure.
In this section, we examine the latent influence structure and account interactions learned by AMDN-HAGE on the IRA data. The
latent influence is captured by the interpretable attention weights
of the model, between account activities in observed traces. Higher
attention paid by an event (account activity) on a history event (earlier activity from any account), indicates that the history event has
a stronger triggering influence on the future event in consideration.

In Fig4a, we compute the aggregate influence between account
pairs learned with AMDN-HAGE over 5 random seeds (as average
attention weight from account interactions over all activity traces).
The strongest influence ties are between coordinated (“trolls") (T) accounts, and the least influence is between normal (“non-trolls (NT)")
and coordinated (T) accounts and their activities. In Figure 4b, the
learned account embeddings of coordinated and normal accounts
with AMDN-HAGE in the IRA data is visualized. As we see, coordinated accounts form an anomalous cluster distinct from normal
accounts, reflecting our model captures coordinated behaviours.
In Fig. 5a and 5b, we examine how influence weights of account
pairs vary with time difference. In the two figures, each point represent an account pair appearing in the same activity sequence.
Blue points refer to coordinated (T) pairs and green points refer
to normal account (NT) pairs. The influence weights (y-axis) correspond to the time difference between activities of two accounts
appearing in the sequence (x-axis) is shown for all points in Fig. 5a
to reflect the overall trend. In Fig. 5b, we only plot points with
highest influence weight in each time difference range of 24 hrs
to reflect the trend on strongly interacting pairs in each window.
From both figures, we can see that influence weights are higher
for shorter time differences between account activities. However,
the influence decreases faster for coordinated pairs than normal
account pairs with the passage of time between their activities.

This phenomenon suggests that compared to normal social influence, the coordination is more temporal. Meanwhile, it is noticeable that a small fraction of coordination last even longer than
2000 hours (nearly 3 months), reflecting that the assumption on
synchronization may fail in detecting such long-term coordination.
5.4.2 Uncovering coordinated groups in COVID-19 data. As mentioned earlier, the data collected on COVID-19 does not contain
a ground-truth set of labeled coordinated accounts. But, we can
use the proposed method AMDN-HAGE to uncover any suspicious
coordinated accounts with analysis of features. AMDN-HAGE is
trained on observed account activities in the COVID-19 data of
119𝑘 accounts. The method identifies two anomalous clusters of accounts (based on clustering silhouette scores, provided in appendix).
We inspect the feature distribution in each account group.
In Table 3, we compare the distribution of suspended Twitter
accounts. Twitter additionally labels some suspended accounts as
state-backed i.e, accounts Twitter finds as linked to state-sponsored
operations (such as from Russia, etc. that tried to interfere with politics in other countries) [8]. In addition, we consider the “coupled"
accounts in the collected data that bidirectionally engage with Twitter’s state-backed accounts, and “targets" as accounts mentioned
(or targeted) by state-backed accounts in their tweets. Amongst all
the 119k accounts, the distribution of Twitter accounts (Suspended,

State-backed, Coupled) was between 1.5-2 times higher than by
random chance in the identified anomalous clusters, even when the
number of such accounts to be found from the large set of collected
accounts is small. For Targets, the distribution is more uniform,
since targeted accounts unlike Coupled only capture a unidirectional engagement attempt from state-backed accounts, which is
expected because state-backed accounts attempt to manipulate and
thus mention or engage with other normal accounts.
In Fig 6, we find most frequent hashtags in tweets posted by
accounts in the groups, and plot the top hashtags unique to each
group (hashtags of the smaller anomalous cluster is provided in
the appendix). We find that the prominent top hundred hashtags in
the coordinated group promote anti-mask and anti-vaccine (“NoMasks", “NoVaccine", “NoALaVacuna"), and anti-science theories
(“Plandemic", “Covid-Hoax"), and contain hashtags associated with
“QAnon" (“WWG1WGA"), a notorious far-right conspiracy group.
In Table 4 we use topic modeling to find the most representative
disinformation tweets posted by the anomalous accounts. We find 4
topic clusters within tweets that are linked to low-credibility (disinformation) news sources. The table shows tweets closest to the topic
cluster centers. The narrative in the hashtags and topics suggests
strong presence of tweets in Spanish and English (NoALaMascarillaObligatori, NoALaVacuna, NoAlNuevoOrdenMundia, NoVaccine)
about no new world order, no masks, no vaccine, and QAnon, all
opposing Bill Gates, and suggesting that COVID-19 is a hoax and
deep state or political scam to monetize vaccines.

CONCLUSIONS

In this work, we proposed a technique to detect coordinated accounts based on their collective behaviours, inferred directly from
their activities on social media. The proposed method is independent of linguistic, metadata or platform specific features, and hence
can be generalized across platforms and languages or countries
from where disinformation campaigns originate. Such features can
also be easily incorporated in the proposed model.
With analysis on Russian Interference and COVID-19 datasets,
we investigated the behaviours of identified coordinated accounts,
finding that influence between coordinated accounts is higher, and
influence between coordinated pair of accounts decreases faster
than non-coordinated pairs over time. In the COVID-19 data, we
identified coordinated groups, and analysis suggests that the main
narrative in the coordinated group is that COVID-19 is a hoax and
political scam, with anti-vaccine, anti-mask social media posts.

Details of Experiments

Implementation details We use activity sequences of maximum

pre-train step of training algorithm (Fig. 7). For the shared covariance matrix of HAGE part, we constrain it to be a diagonal matrix.
The second term of the loss is scaled for embedding dimension and

entirely in PyTorch and use Adam with 1e-3 learning rate and 1e5 regularization to optimize. We train for max 1000 epochs with
early stopping based on validation likelihood of sequences (75/15/10

Number of Clusters

Figure 7: Selection of number of clusters based on silhouette
scores in COVID-19 and IRA datasets.

Here we provide the details of our baselines:
Also, we present some numeric results and statistic properties
we found on the COVID-19 dataset. We compare the distribution of
account creation years in COVID-19 dataset for each identified accounts group or cluster. As we can see, the ratio of accounts created
in recent years is higher in the two detected anomalous clusters,
which is consistent to the reality that coordinated campaigns are
raised in recent years. Also, we present the hashtag distribution
in the C1 cluster in Figure 9. Surprisingly, although the ratio of
suspended coordinated users in this cluster is significantly higher

% Accounts Created / Year

(1) Co-activity clustering [18]. Co-activity features to identify
coordinated groups as accounts that repeatedly share the
same contents, was proposed in Ruchansky et al. Account features are extracted using SVD on a binary event-participation
matrix (of accounts and its posts i.e., tweets, retweets, replies).
Clustering on the features are used to detect coordination.
(2) Clickstream clustering [17, 24]. It is proposed by Wang et al.
to analyze account behaviours, and is based on hierarchical clustering of accounts with similar activity patterns to
identify coordinated groups. Similarity between activities is
represented based on post, reply and re-share patterns.
(3) IRL (S) [12]. SOTA approach is based on inverse reinforcement learning to discover motives of coordinated accounts
from rewards estimated from activity traces. Estimated rewards are used as features for detection. IRL(S) trains AdaBoost on these features on a labeled subset of coordinated
and normal accounts. Luceri et al. reported different classifiers in their paper, including two-layer MLP and AdaBoost,
with the latter outperforming others on their features.
(4) IRL [12]. We also compare an unsupervised variant of the
SOTA IRL approach based on clustering with GMM or Kmeans clustering to detect coordinated groups.

Identifying Coordinated Accounts on Social Media through Hidden Influence and Group Behaviours

Figure 9: Hashtag distribution for cluster C1 (COVID-19 dataset).
than normal, the hashtags look not like disinformation contents or
topics. Upon further inspection, we find the political hashtags like
“Resist" or “Resistance" in the top-50 unique hashtags of this cluster,
refer to U.S. liberal political movement against the reigning president, and have not been linked to disinformation or conspiracies.
This phenomenon suggests coordination may not be specific to
disinformation spreading. In normal information spreading, there
could be the influence from coordinated campaigns.

Details of Neural Point Process Models

Methods SAHP [31] and THP [33] (Table 1 require Monte Carlo
sampling to estimate an integral in the likelihood function used
in MLE, as their intensity formulation does not have closed form
solutions. This leads to more noisy approximation of gradients in
training the model. On the other hand, HP [32], RMTPP [6] define
specific functional forms, e.g. exponential for intensity parameterization to have closed form likelihoods but are limited in the
flexibility of the selected functional form of the intensity. LogNormMix [22] and FullyNN [16] alleviate these issues by modeling the
conditional density and cumulative density getting flexibility and
closed-form likelihoods. However, the neural network parameterizations in RMTPP, LogNormMix, FullyNN are based on recurrent
neural networks and cannot be directly used to examine the influence between events and event types, which is possible in the other
methods. We address this by modeling the conditional density function with interpretable neural network parameterizations, so that
the influence structure can be learned and examined to understand
coordinated behaviours of malicious accounts, and still have the
same form for the point process conditional PDF as LogNormMix.

Thus, we obtain

(𝑖)

, 𝐸 (𝑖−1) , 𝜃𝑔 ) ≤ 𝐿(𝜃 𝑎

(15)

Then, from the second condition, we know that:
(𝑖)

(𝑖)

(𝑖−1)

𝐿(𝜃 𝑎 , 𝐸 (𝑖) , 𝜃𝑔 ) ≤ 𝐿(𝜃 𝑎

(𝑖)

, 𝐸 (𝑖−1) , 𝜃𝑔 )

(16)

Therefore, we have:
(𝑖)

𝐿(𝜃 𝑎 , 𝐸 (𝑖) , 𝜃𝑔 ) ≤ 𝐿(𝜃 𝑎

(17)

which means the loss function monotonically decreases. Since we
constraint the variance of the mixture model in both point processing model and social group model larger than a constant 𝜖, the loss
function is bounded by a constant 𝐶 on a given activity trace set:
(𝑖)

(𝑖)

𝐿(𝜃 𝑎 , 𝐸 (𝑖) , 𝜃𝑔 ) ≥ 𝐶

(18)

Thus the loss function converges when 𝑖 increases. Then we prove
that the loss function converges at a local minimum or a saddle
point. First when the parameters converges, we have:
(𝑖)

(𝑖)

(𝑖+1)

𝐿(𝜃 𝑎 , 𝐸 (𝑖) , 𝜃𝑔 ) = 𝐿(𝜃 𝑎

(𝑖+1)

, 𝐸 (𝑖+1) , 𝜃𝑔

(19)

Thus:
