We introduce the Generalized Rescaled Pólya (GRP) urn, that provides three different generative models for a chi-squared test of goodness of fit for the long-term probabilities of clusterized
data, with independence between clusters and correlation, due to a reinforcement mechanism, inside each cluster. We apply the proposed test to a “big” dataset of Twitter posts about COVID-19
pandemic: in a few words, for a classical χ2 test the data result strongly significant for the rejection
of the null hypothesis (the daily sentiment rate remains constant), but, taking into account the
correlation among data, the introduced test leads to a different conclusion. Beside the statistical
application, we point out that the GRP urn is a simple variant of the standard Eggenberger-Pólya
urn, that, with suitable choices of the parameters, shows “local” reinforcement, almost sure convergence of the empirical mean to a deterministic limit and different asymptotic behaviours of the
predictive mean.

Introduction

The standard Eggenberger-Pólya urn (see [23, 34]) has been widely studied and generalized (some
recent variants can be found in [3, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 16, 18, 19, 25, 26, 32, 33]). In its simplest form,
this model with k-colors works as follows. An urn contains N0 i balls of color i, for i = 1, . . . , k,
and, at each discrete time, a ball is extracted from the urn and then it is returned inside the urn
together with α > 0 additional balls of the same color. Therefore, if we denote by Nn i the number
of balls of color i in the urn at time n, we have
Nn i = Nn−1 i + αξn i

for n ≥ 1,

where ξn i = 1 if the extracted ball at time n is of color i, and ξn i = 0 otherwise. The parameter
α
Pnregulates the reinforcement mechanism: the greater α, the greater the dependence of Nn i on
h=1 ξh i .
The “Rescaled” Pólya (RP) urn model, presented in [3], is characterized by the introduction
of the parameter β, together with the initial parameters (b0 i )i=1,...,k and (B0 i )i=1,...,k , next to the
parameter α of the original model, so that
Nn i = b0 i + B n i

with

Bn i = βBn−1 i + αξn i

n ≥ 1.

Therefore, the urn initially contains b0 i +B0 i balls of color i and the parameter β ≥ 0, together with
α > 0, regulates the reinforcement mechanism. More precisely, the term βBn−1 i links Nn i to the
“configuration” at time n−1 through the “scaling” parameter β, and the term αξn i links Nn i to the
outcome of the extraction at time n through the parameter α. Note that the case β = 1 corresponds
to the standard Eggenberger-Pólya urn with an initial number N0 i = b0 i + B0 i of balls of color
i. When β ∈ [0, 1), this variant of the Eggenberger-Pólya urn shows the following features: (i) a
“local” reinforcement, i.e. a reinforcement mechanism mainly based on the last observations, (ii)

a long-term almost sure convergence of the empirical mean n=1 ξn i /N to the deterministic limit

Pn
p0 i = b0 i / i=1 b0 i , and (iii) a chi-squared goodness of fit result for the long-term probabilities
{p0 1 , . . . , p0 k }. In particular, regarding the point (iii), we have that the chi-squared statistics

where N is the size of the sample, pbi = Oi /N , with Oi the number of observations equal to i in

the sample, is asymptotically distributed as χ2 (k − 1)λ = Γ( k−1
2 , 2λ ), with λ > 1. This constant
λ, due to the presence of correlation among units, mitigate the effect of the sample size N in
(1), that multiplies the chi-squared distance between the observed frequencies and the expected
probabilities. Indeed, the observed value of the chi-squared distance has to be compared with the
“critical” value χ21−θ (k − 1)λ/N , where χ21−θ (k − 1) denotes the quantile of order 1 − θ of the
chi-squared distribution χ2 (k − 1). This aspect is important for the statistical applications in the
context of a “big sample”, when a small value of the chi-squared distance might be significant, and
hence a correction related to the correlation between observations is desirable (see, for instance,
[10, 12, 15, 24, 27, 30, 36, 40, 41, 43]).
In this work, we replace the two parameters α and β by two sequences (αn )n and (βn )n , in
order to give more flexibility to the model and capture different asymptotic behaviours. We call
this new variant of the Eggenberger-Pólya urn Generalized Rescaled Pólya (GRP) urn. Besides
the Eggenberger-Pólya urn and the RP urn, the GRP urn model also includes as special cases the
models illustrated in [28] and [38].
Referring to the above issues (ii)-(iii), we show that, with a suitable choice of the model parameters, we still have the almost sure convergence of pbi = Oi /N to the probability p0 i , together with a
chi-squared goodness of fit result, where the effect of the sample size N is weakened by the presence
of correlation. More precisely, we present a case where, as before, the chi-squared statistics (1) is
asymptotically distributed as χ2 (k − 1)λ, with λ > 1, and another case where it is asymptotically
distributed as χ2 (k − 1)N 1−2e λ, where λ > 0 may be smaller than 1, but e is always strictly smaller
than 1/2. In particular, in the second case, the critical value for the chi-squared distance becomes
χ21−θ (k − 1)λ/N 2e , where, although the constant λ may be smaller than 1, the effect of the sample
size N is mitigated by the exponent 2e < 1. Summing up, the GRP urn provides three models
(the RP urn introduced and studied in [3] and the other two analyzed in the present work), each
of them presenting different limit features and all of them suitable as theoretical frameworks for
a chi-squared test of goodness of fit for the long-term probabilities of correlated data, generated
according to a reinforcement mechanism. It is worthwhile to underline that the results proven in
this work do not cover (and are not covered by) those obtained for the RP urn in [3]. Moreover, as
explained in the following Section 2, the techniques required here and in [3] are completely different.
Regarding issue (i), we show that the provided examples exhibit a broader sense local reinforcement, in the sense that the “weight” of the observations is eventually increasing with time.
Finally, we underline that the almost sure convergence of the predictive mean ψn i = E[ξn+1 i =
1| “past”] is typically proven for urn models, in order to apply “stochastic approximation central
limit theorems”, where it is assumed as an hypothesis. In the GRP this kind of convergence is
not always guaranteed (see, for instance, the RP urn model, where we have a random persistent
fluctuation of the predictive mean) or it is not easy to check if it holds or not (see Section 8 for
more details). Therefore, in these cases, different proof arguments are necessary.
The sequel of the paper is so structured. In Section 2 we set up our notation, we define the
Generalized Rescaled Pólya (GRP) urn and we discuss its relationships with previous models. In
Section 3 we provide the main result of this work, that is the almost sure convergence of the
empirical means to the deterministic limits p0 i and the goodness of fit result for the long-term
probabilities p0 i , together with comments and examples. In Section 4 we state two convergence
results for the empirical means, which are the basis for the proof of the main theorem, and Section
5 collects some related simulations. In Section 6 we describe a possible statistical application of
the GRP urn and the related results in the context of a big sample, inspired by [3, 12, 35]. More

3

precisely, it is a chi-squared test of goodness of fit for the long-term probabilities of clusterized data,
with independence between clusters and correlation, due to a reinforcement mechanism, inside each
cluster. We apply the proposed test to a dataset of Twitter posts about COVID-19 pandemic [2].
Given the null hypothesis that the daily sentiment rate of the posts is the same for all the considered days (suitably spaced days in the period February 20th - April 20th 2020), performing a
classical χ2 test, the data result strongly significant for the rejection of the null hypothesis, while,
taking into account the correlation among posts sent in the same day, the proposed test leads to
a different conclusion. All the shown theoretical results are analytically proven. The proofs are
left to Section S1 in the Supplementary Material [1], except for the proof of Theorem 4.2, which
is methodologically new and emphasizes new techniques of martingale limit theory and so it is
illustrated in Section 8. Finally, in the Supplementary Material we also provide some complements,
some technical lemmas and some recalls about stochastic approximation theory and about stable
convergence. When necessary, the references to the Supplementary Material are preceded by an
“S”, so that (S1.2) will refer to the equation (S1.2) in [1].

The Generalized Rescaled Pólya (GRP) urn

In all the sequel, we suppose given two sequences of parameters (αn )n≥1 , with αn > 0 and
Pk
(βn )n≥0 with βn ≥ 0. Given a vector x = (x1 , . . . , xk )> ∈ Rk , we set |x| =
i=1 |xi | and
P
k
kxk2 = x> x = i=1 |xi |2 . Moreover we denote by 1 and 0 the vectors with all the components
equal to 1 and equal to 0, respectively.
The urn initially contains b0 i + B0 i > 0 distinct balls of color i, with i = 1, . . . , k. We set
b0 = (b0 1 , . . . , b0 k )> and B0 = (B0 1 , . . . , B0 k )> . We assume |b0 | > 0 and we set p0 = |bb00 | . At
each discrete time (n + 1) ≥ 1, a ball is drawn at random from the urn, obtaining the random
vector ξn+1 = (ξn+1 1 , . . . , ξn+1 k )> defined as
(
1 when the extracted ball at time n + 1 is of color i
ξn+1 i =
0 otherwise,
and the number of balls in the urn is so updated:
Nn+1 = b0 + Bn+1

with

Bn+1 = βn Bn + αn+1 ξn+1 ,

(2)

which gives (since |ξn+1 | = 1)
|Bn+1 | = βn |Bn | + αn+1 .
Therefore, setting

rn∗

= |Nn | = |b0 | + |Bn |, we get

rn+1
= rn∗ + (βn − 1)|Bn | + αn+1 ,

that is
Moreover, setting F0 equal to the trivial σ-field and Fn = σ(ξ1 , . . . , ξn ) for n ≥ 1, the conditional
probabilities ψn = (ψn 1 , . . . , ψn k )> of the extraction process, also called predictive means, are
ψn = E[ξn+1 |Fn ] =

n ≥ 0.

(5)

It is obvious that we have |ψn | = 1. Moreover, when βn > 0 for all n, the probability ψn i results
increasing with the number of times we observed the value i, that is the random variables ξn i are
generated according to a reinforcement mechanism: the probability that the extraction of color i

occurs has an increasing dependence on the number of extractions of color i occurred in the past
(see, e.g. [39]). More precisely, we have

|b0 | + |B0 | j=0 βj + h=1 αh j=h βj
Qn−1
The dependence of ψn on ξh depends on the factor f (h, n) = αh j=h βj , with 1 ≤ h ≤ n, n ≥ 0.
In the case of the standard Eggenberger-Pólya urn, that corresponds to αn = α > 0 and βn = 1
for all n, each observation ξh has the same “weight” f (h, n) = α. Instead, if the factor f (h, n)
increases with h, then the main contribution is given by the most recent extractions. We refer to
this phenomenon as “local” reinforcement. For instance, this is the case when (αn ) is increasing
and βn = 1 for all n. Another case is when αn = α > 0 and βn < 1 for all n. The case βn = 0
for all n is an extreme case, for which ψn depends only on the last extraction ξn (recall that
Qn−1
conventionally j=n = 1). For the next examples, we will show that they exhibit a broader sense
local reinforcement, in the sense that the “weight” of the observations is eventually increasing with
time.
By means of (5), together with (2) and (3), we have

The particular case when βn = β = 0 for all n corresponds to a version of the so-called “memory-1
senile reinforced random walk” on a star-shaped graph introduced in [28]. The case αn = α > 0 and
βn = β = 1 for all n corresponds to the standard Eggenberger-Pólya urn with an initial number
N0 i = b0 i + B0 i of balls of color i. When (αn ) is a not-constant sequence, while βn = β = 1
for all n, the GRP urn coincides with the variant of the Eggenberger-Pólya urn introduced in [38]
(see also [39, Sec. 3.2]). Instead, when β 6= 1, the GRP urn does not fall in any variants of the
Eggenberger-Pólya urn discussed in [39, Sec. 3.2]. The case when αn = α > 0 and βn = β ≥ 0 for
all n corresponds to the Rescaled Pólya (RP) urn introduced and studied in [3]. When (βn ) is not
identically equal to 1, since the first term in the right hand of the above relation, the GRP urn does
not belong to the class of Reinforced Stochastic Processes (RSPs) studied in [4, 6, 5, 20, 21, 22].
Indeed, the RSPs are characterized by a “strict” reinforcement mechanism such that ξn i = 1 implies
ψn i > ψn−1 i and so, as a consequence, ψn i has an increasing dependence on the number of times
we have ξh i = 1 for h = 1, . . . , n. When (βn ) is not identically equal to 1, the GRP urn does
not satisfy the “strict” reinforcement mechanism, because the first term is positive or negative
according to the sign of (1 − βn ) and of (ψn − p0 ). Furthermore, we observe that equation (7)
recalls the dynamics of a RSP with a “forcing input” (see [4, 20, 42]), but the main difference relies
on the fact that the GRP urn model also allows for the two cases:

Different kinds of sequences (n )n and (δn )n provide different kinds of asymptotic behaviour of

almost sure convergence of the empirical mean Oi /N = n=1 ξn i /N toward the constant p0i =
b0 i /|b0 |, together with a chi-squared goodness of fit result. In particular, the quantities p0 1 , . . . , p0 k
can be seen as a long-run probability distribution on the possible values (colors) {1, . . . , k}.
It is worthwhile to point out that the two cases studied in the present work do not include
(and are not included in) the case αn = α > 0 and βn = β ∈ [0, 1), studied in [3]. Moreover, the
techniques employed here and in [3] are completely different: when βn = β ∈ [0, 1) as in [3], the
jumps ∆ψn do not vanish and the process ψ = (ψn )n converges to a stationary Markov chain and
so the appropriate Markov ergodic theory is employed; in this work, we have |∆ψn | = o(1), so that
the martingale limit theory is here exploited to achieve the asymptotic results. Obviously, the two
techniques are not exchangeable or adaptable from one contest to the other one.

the probability p0 i , together with a chi-squared goodness of fit test for the long-term probabilities
p0 1 , . . . , p0 k . More precisely, we prove the following result:
Theorem 3.1. Assume p0 i > 0 for all i = 1, . . . , k and suppose to be in one of the following cases:
a) n = (n + 1)− and δn = cn , with  ∈ (0, 1] and c > 0, or

We note that λ is a constant greater than 1 in case a); while, in case b), it is a strictly positive

As a consequence, we have N 1−2e λ > 1 for N large enough.
In the next two examples we show that it is possible to construct suitable sequences (αn )n and
(βn )n such that the corresponding sequences (n )n and (δn ) converge to zero with the same rate or
with different rates and satisfy the assumptions a) or b) of the above theorem, respectively.

The case when (n )n and (δn )n in (8) go to zero with different rates is typically neglected in
SA literature. To our best knowledge, it is taken into consideration only in [37], where the weak
convergence rate of the sequence (ψn ) toward a certain point ψ ∗ is established under suitable
assumptions, given the event {ψn → ψ ∗ }. No result is given for the empirical mean ξ N , which
instead is the focus of the present paper, as shown in the following theorem (proven in Section 8):
Theorem 4.2. Take n = (n + 1)− and δn ∼ c(n + 1)−δ , with  ∈ (0, 1), δ ∈ (/2, ) and c > 0.

Simulations

In this section, we provide some simulations related to Theorem 4.1 and Theorem 4.2 stated above.
More precisely, we have simulated the model in the two different cases following Example 3.2 and
Example 3.3. In both cases, we have k = 3, b0 = p0 = (0.167, 0.333, 0.5) (in order to show possible
asymmetries in the convergence) and N in {100, 316, 1 000, 3 162, 10 000, 31 623, 100 000} (unformly
spaced in log-scale). Each sinulation is made with 1 000 independent replicas.
Firstly, we show for both the theorems the convergence of the empirical mean ξ N to p0 , by
PN
plotting the mean value of the empirical mean ξ N = n=1 ξn i /N , for i = 1, 2, 3 and the different
values of N , together with its standard deviation.
Then, we consider the CLT. To this regard, we point out that, as shown in the analytical proofs,
we have

N 1/2−(−δ) ξ N − p0 = DOM + REM ,
where DOM is a “dominant factor” converging to the Gaussian distribution with the appropriate
variance, while REM is a remainder part which is eventually negligible.

Finally, we show that in any set of data the CLT is experimentally found for N 1/2−(−δ) ξ N − p0
with a Gaussian distribution of the form N (0, λ̂Γ), where λ̂ = λ̂(, δ) is the standard deviation computed with the simulated data.

Simulations of Theorem 4.1

The results of Theorem 4.1 are here shown simulating the model by means of Example 3.2 with
n = δn = (1 + n) , where  ∈ {0.30, 0.40, 0.50, 0.85, 1.00} and c = 1.
Fig. 1 shows the convergence of the empirical means to p0 .
For what concerns the CLT, we observe that

N ξ N − p0 = (c + 1) N ξ N − ψ N −1 − N DN ,

where the first term tends to N (0, (c + 1)2 Γ) and the remainder term N DN tends to 0 only when
 < 1. Indeed, when  = 1, we have a different value for the constant λ in Theorem 4.1. These
facts are summarized in Fig. 2 and Fig 3.


Finally, Fig. 4 shows the convergence in distribution of N ξ N − p0 to a Gaussian distribution of the form N (0, λ̂Γ), where λ̂ = λ̂(, δ) is the standard deviation computed with the simulated
data.

Simulations of Theorem 4.2

We have simulated the model following Example 3.3 with k = 3, b0 = p0 = (0.167, 0.333, 0.5)
(so that c = 1) and different values for the parameters  and δ. The total number of performed
(independent) replications is again 1 000.

Finally, Fig. 8 shows the convergence in distribution of N 1/2−(−δ) ξ N − p0 to a Gaussian
distribution of the form N (0, λ̂Γ), where λ̂ = λ̂(, δ) is the standard deviation computed with
simulated data. For some values of  and δ, the constant λ̂ is not equal to the theoretical value
1/[1 + 2( − δ)], because the term (13) goes to 0 slowly. However, it is worth to note that this
issue does not matter for the statistical application of the result, since, as described in Section 6,
we estimate the pair (η = 2( − δ), λ) from the data.

Statistical applications

In a big sample the units typically can not be assumed independent and identically distributed,
but they exhibit a structure in clusters, with independence between clusters and with correlation
inside each cluster [12, 17, 29, 35, 44, 45]. The model and the related results presented in [3] and
in the present paper may be useful in the situation when inside each cluster the probability that
a certain unit chooses the value i is affected by the number of units in the same cluster that have
already chosen the value i, hence according to a reinforcement rule. Formally, given a “big” sample
{ξ n : n = 1, . . . , N }, we suppose that the N units are ordered so that we have the following L
clusters of units:
( `−1
)
`

C` =
Nl + 1, . . . ,
Nl ,
` = 1, . . . , L.

Therefore, the cardinality of each cluster C` is N` . We assume that the units in different clusters
are independent, that is
[ξ1 , . . . , ξN1 ], . . . , [ξP`−1 Nl +1 , . . . , ξP`l=1 Nl ], . . . , [ξPL−1 Nl +1 , . . . , ξN ]

are L independent multidimensional random variables. Moreover, we assume that the observations
inside each cluster can be modeled as a GRP satisfying case a) or case b) of Theorem 3.1. Given
certain (strictly positive) intrinsic probabilities p∗0 1 (`), . . . , p∗0 k (`) for each cluster C` , we firstly
want to estimate the model parameters and then perform a test with null hypothesis

Estimation of the parameters

The model parameters are , δ and c. However, as we have seen, the fundamental quantities are
η = 2( − δ) and λ given in (11). Moreover, recall that in case a), we have η = 0 and λ > 1 and, in
case b), we have η ∈ (0, 1) and λ > 0. Therefore, according the considered model, the pair (η, λ)

We immediately observe that, when all the clusters have the same cardinality, that is all the
N` are equal to a certain N0 , then we cannot hope to estimate η and λ, separately. Indeed, the

ln(L(η, λ)) → −∞ for λ → +∞ and λ → 0. Thus, the log-likelihood function has maximum value
on the closure S of S and its maximum points are stationary points belonging to (0, 1) × (0, +∞) or

COVID-19 epidemic Twitter analysis

We illustrate the application of the above statistical methodology to a dataset containing posts
on the on-line social network Twitter about the COVID-19 epidemic. More precisely, the dataset
covers the period from February 20th (h. 11pm) to April to 20th (h. 10pm) 2020, including tweets
in Italian language. More details on the keywords used for the query can be found in [14]. For every
message, the relative sentiment has been calculated using the polyglot python module developed
in [46]. This module provides a numerical value v for the sentiment and we have fixed a threshold
T = 0.35 so that we have classified as a tweet with positive sentiment those with v > T and
as a tweet with negative sentiment those with v < −T . We have discarded tweets with a value
v ∈ [−T, T ].
We are in the case k = 2 and the random variables ξn = ξn 1 take the value 1 when the sentiment
of the post n is positive. We have partitioned the data so that each set Pd collect the messages of the
single day d, for d = 1(February 20st), . . . , 61(April 20th) and then, in order to obtain independent
clusters, we have set C` = P1+3(`−1) , for ` = 1, . . . , 21 = L. Therefore N` is the total number of
PL
tweets posted during the day 1 + 3(` − 1) and N = `=1 N` = 699 450 is the sample size. Inside
each cluster, the “sentiment” associated to each message is driven by a reinforcement mechanism,
that can be modeled by means of a GRP: the probability to have a tweet with positive sentiment is
increasing with the number of past tweets with positive sentiment and the reinforcement is mostly
driven by the most recent tweets (see [2]).
Our purpose is to test the null hypothesis H0 : p0 (`) = p0 for any `. Therefore, taking
PN
p∗0 1 (`) = p∗0 = n=1 ξn /N for each `, we have firstly estimated the model parameters and then
PL
we have performed the chi-squared test based on the aggregate statistics `=1 Q` and its corre1

b
λ = 2.728098 (in Fig. 9 we plot the function (16)).
The contingency table and the associated statistics for testing H0 is given in Table 1. The
obtained χ2 -statistics for a usual χ2 -test is 5507.803, which is significant at any level of
Pconfidence.
L
Under the proposed GRP model and the null hypothesis, the aggregate statistics
`=1 Q` has
L−1 1
(asymptotic) distribution Γ( 2 , b ) and the corresponding p-value associated to the data is equal
2λ
to 0.4579297. The null hypothesis that the daily sentiment rate of the posts is the same for all the
considered days is therefore strongly rejected with a classical χ2 test, while the same hypothesis is
accepted if we take into account the reinforcement mechanism of correlation given in GRP model.
Finally, in Fig. 10 there are the values of the single statistics Q` . We have tested the inde-

Proof of Theorem 4.2

PN

For all the sequel, we set ψ N −1 = n=1 ψn−1 /N and θ N −1 = n=1 θn−1 /N . To the proof of
Theorem 4.2, we premise some intermediate results.
Lemma 8.1. Under the same assumptions of Theorem 4.2, we have E[kθn k2 ] = O(n−2δ ) → 0.
Proof. We observe that, starting from (8), we get
kθn+1 k2 = θn+1 > θn+1 = (1 − n )2 kθn k2 + δn2 k∆Mn+1 k2 + 2(1 − n )δn θn > ∆Mn+1
and so
E[kθn+1 k2 |Fn ] = (1 − n )2 kθn k2 + δn2 E[k∆Mn+1 k2 |Fn ] .

(17)

Hence, setting xn = E[kθn k ], we get

/2. Applying Lemma S4.4 (with γn = 2n ), we find

that lim supn xn ≤ lim supn ζn . On the other hand, since (∆Mn+1 )n is uniformly bounded and
2

2n /δn2 ∼ c−2 n−2(−δ) → 0, we have ζn = O(n + δn2 −1

we obtain N e E |RN | = O(N e−(1−) ) = O(N δ−1/2 ) → 0 when δ < 1/2. However, in the considered
cases 1) and 2), we might have δ ≥ 1/2. Therefore, we need other arguments in order to prove the
last statement. To this purpose, we observe that, by Lemma 8.1, we have E[ |θn | ] = O(n/2−δ )

p0 . In particular, when  ∈ (1/2, 1) and δ ∈ (1/2, ), we have θN −→ 0, that is ψN −→ p0 .
Note that, when  ∈ (1/2, 1) and δ ∈ (1/2, ), we have the typical asymptotic behaviour of
the predictive mean of an urn process, that is its almost sure convergence. In the complementary
case, it seems to us not so easy to check if this type of convergence holds true. Therefore, for
the proof of Theorem 4.2 in this last case, we will employ a different technique, which is based on
the L2 -estimate of Lemma 8.1 for the predictive mean ψN and the almost sure convergence of the
corresponding empirical mean ψ N −1 .
Proof. Let us distinguish the following two cases:

22

1)  ∈ (1/2, 1) and δ ∈ (1/2, ) or
2)  ∈ (0, 1) and δ ∈ (/2, min{, 1/2}] \ {}.
For the case 1), we observe that, by (17), we have
E[kθn+1 k2 |Fn ] ≤ (1 + 2n )E[kθn k2 |Fn ] + δn2 E[k∆Mn+1 k2 |Fn ].
P 2
Therefore,
since (∆Mn+1 )n is uniformly bounded and, in case 1), we have

consequence, it converges almost surely to a certain random variable. This limit random variable
is necessarily equal to 0 because, by Lemma 8.1, we have E[kθn k2 ] = O(n−2δ ) → 0. Hence, we
have the almost sure convergence of θN to 0 and, consequently, the almost sure convergence of
θ N −1 to 0 follows by Lemma S4.2 and Remark S4.3 (with cn = n and vN,n = n/N ), because
E[θn−1 |Fn−2 ] = (1 − n−2 )θn−2 → 0 almost surely.
a.s.
For the case 2), we use Lemma 8.2, that gives the decomposition (18), with RN −→ 0. Indeed,
PN −1 δn
by this decomposition, it is enough to prove that the term n=0 n ∆Mn+1 /N converges almost
surely to 0. To this purpose, we observe that, if we set

and so θ N −1 −→ 0.
Proof of Theorem 4.2. Set e = 1/2 − ( − δ) ∈ (0, 1/2) and λ = c2 /[2(1 − e)] = c2 /[1 + 2( − δ)].
Moreover, let us distinguish the following two cases:
1)  ∈ (1/2, 1) and δ ∈ (1/2, ) or
2)  ∈ (0, 1) and δ ∈ (/2, min{, 1/2}] \ {}.
Almost sure convergence: In case 1), by Lemma 8.3, ψN converges almost surely to p0 . Therefore,
the almost sure convergence of ξ N to p0 follows by Lemma S4.2 and P
Remark S4.3 (with cP
n = n and
vN,n = n/N ), because E[ξn+1 |Fn ] = ψn → p0 almost surely and n E[kξn k2 ]n−2 ≤ n n−2 <

In case 2), we use a different argument. Take γ ∈ [0, e) and set

and so Theorem S1.1 holds true with V = Γ (see Remark S1.2). Therefore, the first term in the

s

N e θ N −1 −→ N (0, λΓ) ,

(21)

then the proof is concluded.

0). Therefore, it is enough to prove that the term n=1 YN,n stably converges to the Gaussian
kernel N (0, λΓ), with λ = c2 /[2(1 − e)] = c2 /[1 + 2( − δ)]. To this purpose, we observe that
PN
E[YN,n |Fn−1 ] = 0 and so n=1 YN,n converges stably to N (0, λΓ) if the conditions (c1) and (c2) of
Theorem S6.1, with V = λΓ, hold true. Regarding (c1), we note that δn−1 /n−1 ∼ cn−δ = cn1/2−e

(22)

Therefore, in case 1), condition (22) immediately follows by the almost sure convergence of ψn to p0 .

Supplemental Materials
In this document we collect some proofs, complements, technical results and recalls, useful for [S01].
Therefore, the notation and the assumptions used here are the same as those used in that paper.

Proofs and intermediate results

We here collect some proofs omitted in the main text of the paper [S01].

S1.1

Proof of Theorem 3.1

The proof is based on Theorem 4.1 (for case a)) and Theorem 4.2 (for case b)). The almost
sure convergence of Oi /N immediately follows since Oi /N = ξ N i . In order to prove the stated
convergence in distribution, we mimic the classical proof for the Pearson chi-squared test based on
the Sherman Morison formula (see [S18]), but see also [S16, Corollary 2].
We start recalling the Sherman Morison formula: if A is an invertible square matrix and we
have 1 − v > A−1 u 6= 0, then
(A − uv > )−1 = A−1 +

A−1 uv > A−1
.
1 − v > A−1 u

∗
Given the observation ξn = (ξn 1 , . . . , ξn k )> , we define the “truncated” vector ξn
= (ξn∗ 1 , . . . , ξn∗ k−1 )> ,
given by the first k − 1 components of ξn . Theorem 4.1 (for case a)) and Theorem 4.2 (for case b))
give the second order asymptotic behaviour of (ξn ), that immediately implies

with YN,n = N −1/2 ∆Mn . For the convergence of n=1 YN,n , we observe that E[YN,k |Fk−1 ] = 0
and so, by Theorem S6.1, it converges stably to N (0, V ) if the conditions (c1) and (c2)√
hold true.
Regarding (c1), we note that max1≤n≤N |YN,n | ≤ √1N max1≤n≤N |ξn − ψn−1 | = O(1/ N ) → 0.

Proof of Theorem 4.1

By Lemma S4.2 (with cn = n and vN,n = n/N ), Remark S4.3 and Theorem S5.1, we immediately
get ξ N → p0 almost
surely. Indeed, we have E[ξn+1 |Fn ] = ψn → p0 almost surely and

Regarding the central limit theorem for ξ N , we have to distinguish the two cases 1/2 <  ≤ 1 or
0 <  ≤ 1/2. In the first case, the result follows from Theorem S5.3, because (10) and the fact that
E[∆Mn+1 ∆Mn+1 > |Fn ] = diag(ψn−1 ) − ψn−1 ψn−1 > → Γ almost surely; while for the second
case the result follows from Theorem S1.1. Indeed, we have

where D N = c ξ N − ψ N −1 − ψ N −1 − p0 . By Theorem S1.1, the term (c+1) N ξ N − ψ N −1
stably converges to N (0, (c + 1)2 Γ) (note that assumption (S1.3) is satisfied with V = Γ, √
because
ψn → p0 almost surely). Therefore, in order to conclude, it is enough to show that N DN
converges in probability to 0. To this purpose, we observe that, by (8) with δn = cn , we have
ψn − ψn−1 = n−1 [c(ξn − ψn−1 ) − (ψn−1 − p0 )]
and so
DN =

Moreover, we note that n=1 (ψn − ψn−1 ) = limN ψN − ψ0 = p0 − ψ0 < +∞ and, by Lemma

Case

P
In this section we provide some results regarding the case n n < +∞, even if, as we will see, this
case is not interesting for the chi-squared test of goodness of fit. Indeed, as shown in the following
result, the empirical mean almost surely converges to a random variable, which does not coincide
almost surely with a deterministic vector.
P+∞
a.s.
Theorem S2.1. If n=0 n < +∞, then ξ N −→ ψ∞ , where ψ∞ is a random variable, which is
not almost surely equal to a deterministic vector, that is P (ψ∞ 6= q0 ) > 0 for all q0 ∈ Rk .
P+∞
Proof. When n=0 n < +∞, the sequence (ψn ) is a (bounded) non-negative almost supermartingale (see [S17]) because, by (8), we have
E[ψn+1 |Fn ] = ψn (1 − n ) + n p0 ≤ ψn + n p0 .

n n ) < +∞, the stochastic process (ψn ) is a non-negative
quasi-martingale and so it converges almost surely (and in Lp with p ≥ 1) to a certain random
variable ψ∞ .
The almost sure convergence of ξ n to ψ∞ follows by Lemma S4.2 and Remark
P S4.3 (with cn = n
and vN,n = n/N ), because E[ξn+1 |Fn ] = ψn → ψ∞ almost surely and n≥1 E[kξn k2 ]n−2 ≤
P

n≥1 n
In order to show that ψ∞ is not almost surely equal to a deterministic vector, we set
yn = E[kψn − p0 k2 ] − kE[ψn − p0 ]k2 =

k
X

V ar[ψn i − p0 i ]

i=1

and observe that, starting from (8), we get
ψn+1 − p0 = (1 − n )(ψn − p0 ) + δn ∆Mn+1
and so
kE[ψn − p0 ]k2 = E[ψn − p0 ]> E[ψn − p0 ] = (1 − n )2 kE[ψn − p0 ]k2
and
E[kψn+1 − p0 k2 ] = E[(ψn+1 − p0 )> (ψn+1 − p0 )]
= (1 − n )2 E[kψn − p0 k2 ] + δn2 E[k∆Mn+1 k2 ] .
Hence, we obtain
yn+1 = (1 − n )2 yn + δn2 E[k∆Mn+1 k2 ] = (1 − 2n )yn + ζen

(S2.4)

with ζen = 2n yn + δn2 E[k∆Mn+1 k2 ] ≥ 0. It follows that, given ñ such that n < 1/2 for n ≥ ñ, we
QN −1
have yN ≥ yñ n=ñ (1 − 2n ) for each N ≥ ñ and so

P+∞
The above exponential is strictly greater than 0 because n=ñ ln(1 − 2n ) ∼ −2 n=ñ n > −∞.
Therefore, if yñ > 0, then we have y∞ > 0. This means that ψ∞ − p0 , and consequently ψ∞ ,
is not almost surely equal to a deterministic vector, that is P (ψ∞ 6= q0 ) > 0 for all q0 ∈ Rk . If
e then, by (S2.4), we get
yñ = 0, that is if ψñ is almost surely equal to a deterministic vector ψ,
e 2] > 0 ,
yñ+1 = δn2 E[k∆Mn+1 k2 ] = δñ2 E[kξñ+1 − ψk
e is different from a vector of the canonical base of Rk by means of
because δn > 0 for each n and ψ
the assumption b0 i + B0 i > 0 and equality (5). It follows that we can repeat the above argument
replacing ñ by ñ + 1 and conclude that ψ∞ is not almost surely equal to a deterministic vector.
As a consequence of the above theorem, if we aim atP
having the almost sure convergence of
+∞
ξ N to a deterministic vector, we have to avoid the case n=0 n < +∞. However, for the sake
of completeness, we provide a second-order convergence result also in this case. First, we note
that Theorem S1.1 still holds true with V = diag(ψ∞ ) − ψ∞ ψ∞ > . Indeed, assumption (S1.3) is
satisfied by Lemma S4.2 and Remark S4.3 (with cn = n and vN,n = n/N ), because of the almost
sure convergence of ψn to ψ∞ . Moreover, we have the following theorem:
Theorem S2.2. Suppose to be in one of the following two cases:

Set e = 1/2 and λ = 1 in case a) and e = δ − 1/2 ∈ (0, 1/2) and λ = c2 /[2(1 − e)] = c2 /(3 − 2δ) in

The case n = 0 (that is βn = 1) for all n corresponds to the case considered in [S15], but in

An example of the case a) of Theorem S2.2 with (ψN − ψ∞ ) = oP (N −e ) is the RP urn with
αn = α > 0 and βn = β > 1 (see [S02]). Indeed, in this case, we have n ∼ c β −n and δn ∼ cδ β −n ,
where c > 0 and cδ > 0 are suitable constants, and (ψN − ψ∞ ) = O(β −N ). We conclude this
section with other two examples regarding the case n = 0 (that is βn = 1) for all n.

cαn+1 = c(n + 1) , with c = P

satisfied. We also observe that n δn2 < +∞ and so ψ∞ i is not concentrated on {0, 1} and has no
atoms in (0, 1) (see [S15, Th. 2 and Th. 3]). More precisely, we have

Since δ > 3/2, we get (ψN − ψ∞ ) = o(N −1/2 ). This fact can also be obtained as a consequence
of Theorem S2.5 below. Indeed, this theorem states that the rate of convergence of ψN to ψ∞ is
N −(δ−1/2) .
Note that, since βn = 1 for all n, the factor f (h, n) in (6) coincides with αh and so, in this case,
it is decreasing.

of Theorem S2.2 is satisfied. We also observe that n δn < +∞ and so ψ∞ i is not concentrated on
{0, 1} and has no atoms in (0, 1) (see [S15, Th. 2 and Th. 3]). Moreover, by Theorem S2.5 below,
we get that N e (ψ N − ψ∞ ) −→N 0, c2 (2e)−1 Γ , where e = δ − 1/2. Hence, applying Theorem

N e ξ N − ψ∞ −→ N 0, c2 [2e(1 − e)]−1 Γ .
Finally, note that, as before, since βn = 1 for all n, the factor f (h, n) in (6) coincides with αh and
so, in this case, `(h) = ln(f (h, n)) = ln(αh ) ∼ ln(δh−1 ) + bhα ∼ bhα − bα(1 − α) ln(h). Hence,
there exists h∗ such that h 7→ `(h) is increasing for h ≥ h∗ . Since maxh≤h∗ `(h) ≤ C, for a suitable
constant C, the contributions of the observations until h∗ are eventually smaller than those with
h ≥ h∗ , that are increasing with h.

Proof. We want to apply Theorem S6.2. To this purpose, we recall that, when n = 0 for all n, the
process (ψn ) is a martingale with respect to F. Moreover, it converges almost surely and in mean
to ψ∞ . Therefore, in order to conclude, it is enough to check conditions (c1) and (c2) of Theorem
S6.2. Regarding the first condition, we note that

using that (x + y)+ ≤ x+ + y + , we have for n ≥ n∗

When n = (1 + n)− , condition (i) is obviously verified, because we have limn n2 /eu(1+n) = 0.
Finally, condition (ii) is always satisfied when n is decreasing, as it is in the case n = (1 + n)− .
Indeed, we simply have supn≤j≤m(tn +T ) j /n = n /n = 1.

For the case  ∈ (1/2, 1], we refer to [S09, Th. 2.1] (with h = Id, U∗ = c2 Γ and γ∗ = 1) and [S14,
Th. 1] (with H = −Id, γn = σn = n and so γ0 = 1 and β = ). For the case  ∈ (0, 1/2], we
refer to [S11, cap.10, Th. 2.1] (with A = −Id). The key assumption for applying this theorem is
√
θn / n tight. On the other hand, in the considered setting, this last condition is satisfied because
of [S11, Th. 4.1]. Note that the limit distribution corresponds to the stationary distribution of the
diffusion
dUt = (−Id + c()) Ut dt + cΓ1/2 dWt ,
where W = (Wt )t is a standard Wiener process and
(
0 for  < 1
c() =
1/2 for  = 1.
Therefore the limit covariance matrix is determined by solving the associated Lyapunov’s equation
[S14], that, in the considered case, simply is

−Σµθ + Σθ = −cΓ
−Σθ = −c2 Γ
and so the proof is concluded by solving this system.

Stable convergence

This brief section contains some basic definitions and results concerning stable convergence. For
more details, we refer the reader to [S05, S07, S10] and the references therein.
Let (Ω, A, P ) be a probability space, and let S be a Polish space, endowed with its Borel σ-field.
A kernel on S, or a random probability measure on S, is a collection K = {K(ω) : ω ∈ Ω} of
probability measures on the Borel σ-field of S such that, for each bounded Borel real function f
on S, the map
Z
ω 7→ Kf (ω) =

f (x) K(ω)(dx)

is A-measurable. Given a sub-σ-field H of A, a kernel K is said H-measurable if all the above
random variables Kf are H-measurable. A probability measure ν can be identified with a constant
kernel K(ω) = ν for each ω.
On (Ω, A, P ), let (Yn )n be a sequence of S-valued random variables, let H be a sub-σ-field of
A, and let K be a H-measurable kernel on S. Then, we say that Yn converges H-stably to K, and
we write Yn −→ K H-stably, if
weakly

P (Yn ∈ · | H) −→ E [K(·) | H]

for all H ∈ H with P (H) > 0,

where K(·) denotes the random variable defined, for each Borel set B of S, as ω 7→ KIB (ω) =
K(ω)(B). In the case when H = A, we simply say that Yn converges stably to K and we write
Yn −→ K stably. Clearly, if Yn −→ K H-stably, then Yn converges in distribution to the probability

S 14

distribution E[K(·)]. The H-stable convergence of Yn to K can be stated in terms of the following
convergence of conditional expectations:
E[f (Yn ) | H]

σ(L1 , L∞ )

−→

Kf

(S6.8)

for each bounded continuous real function f on S. In [S07] the notion of H-stable convergence
is firstly generalized in a natural way replacing in (S6.8) the single sub-σ-field H by a collection
G = (Gn ) (called conditioning system) of sub-σ-fields of A and then it is strengthened by substituting
the convergence in σ(L1 , L∞ ) by the one in probability (i.e. in L1 , since f is bounded). Hence,
according to [S07], we say that Yn converges to K stably in the strong sense, with respect to
G = (Gn ), if
P
E [f (Yn ) | Gn ] −→ Kf
for each bounded continuous real function f on S.
We now conclude this section recalling some convergence results that we apply in our proofs.
From [S10, Th. 3.2] (see also [S07, Th. 5 and Cor. 7] or [S05, Th. 5.5.1 and Cor. 5.5.2]), we get:
Theorem S6.1. Given a filtration F = (Fn )n , let (YN,n )N,n be a triangular array of random
variables with values in Rk such that YN,n is Fn -measurable and E[YN,n |Fn−1 ] = 0. Suppose that
the following two conditions are satisfied:
(c1) E [ max1≤n≤N |YN,n | ] → 0 and
PN
> P
(c2)
n=1 YN,n YN,n −→ V , where V is a random variable with values in the space of positive
semidefinite k × k-matrices.
PN
Then n=1 YN,n converges stably to the Gaussian kernel N (0, V ).
From [S07, Th. 5, Cor. 7, Rem. 4] or [S05, Th. 5.5.1, Cor. 5.5.2, Rem. 5.5.2]), we obtain:
Theorem S6.2. Let (Ln ) be a Rk -valued martingale with respect to the filtration F = (Fn ).
a.s., L1

Suppose that Ln −→ L for some Rk -valued random variable L and
(c1) ne E[supj≥n |Lj−1 − Lj | ] −→ 0 and
P
P
(c2) n2e j≥n (Lj−1 − Lj )(Lj−1 − Lj )> −→ V , where V is a random variable with values in the
space of positive semidefinite k × k-matrices.
Then

ne Ln − L −→ N (0, V )

stably in strong sense w.r.t. F.

Indeed,P
following [S07, Example 6], it is enough to observe that Ln − L can be written as
Ln − L = j≥n (Lj − Lj+1 ).
Finally, the following result combines together a stable convergence and a stable convergence in
the strong sense [S04, Lemma 1].
Theorem S6.3. Suppose that Cn and Dn are S-valued random variables, that M and N are kernels
on S, and that G = (Gn )n is an (increasing) filtration satisfying for all n
S
σ(Cn )⊂Gn and σ(Dn )⊂σ ( n Gn ) .
If Cn stably converges to M and Dn converges to N stably in the strong sense, with respect to G,
then
[Cn , Dn ] −→ M ⊗ N
stably.
(Here, M ⊗ N is the kernel on S × S such that (M ⊗ N )(ω) = M (ω) ⊗ N (ω) for all ω.)

S 15

This last result contains as a special case the fact that stable convergence and convergence in
probability combine well: that is, if Cn stably converges to M and Dn converges in probability to a
random variable D, then (Cn , Dn ) stably converges to M ⊗ δD , where δD denotes the Dirac kernel
concentrated in D.
