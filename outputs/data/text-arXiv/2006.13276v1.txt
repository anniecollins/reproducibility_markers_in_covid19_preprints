Abstract
The current pandemic, caused by the outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID19) in December 2019, has led to a global emergency that has significantly
impacted economies, healthcare systems and personal wellbeing all around the
world. Controlling the rapidly evolving disease requires highly sensitive and specific diagnostics. While real-time RT-PCR is the most commonly used, these
can take up to 8 hours, and require significant effort from healthcare professionals. As such, there is a critical need for a quick and automatic diagnostic
system. Diagnosis from chest CT images is a promising direction. However,
current studies are limited by the lack of sufficient training samples, as acquiring annotated CT images is time-consuming. To this end, we propose a new
deep learning algorithm for the automated diagnosis of COVID-19, which only
requires a few samples for training. Specifically, we use contrastive learning to
train an encoder which can capture expressive feature representations on large
and publicly available lung datasets and adopt the prototypical network for classification. We validate the efficacy of the proposed model in comparison with
other competing methods on two publicly available and annotated COVID-19
CT datasets. Our results demonstrate the superior performance of our model
for the accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 based on chest CT images.

1. Introduction
The latest coronavirus, COVID-19, was initially reported in Wuhan, China
toward the end of 2019 and has since spread rapidly around the globe, leading to
a worldwide crisis [1]. As an infectious lung disease, COVID-19 leads to severe
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and is accompanied by a series of
side effects that include a dry cough, fever, tiredness, shortness of breath, etc.
As of May 24th 2020, more than 5.4 million individuals have been confirmed
as having COVID-19, with a roughly 6.3% case fatality rate around the world,
according to the World Health Organization

1

around the world.

So far, no effective treatment for COVID-19 has been found. One of the
major hurdles is the lack of efficient diagnosis methods. Therefore, an accurate and rapid diagnosis platform is urgently required to conduct COVID-19
screening and prevent its further spread. Currently, most tests are based on
real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). However,
each PT-PCR test can take several hours to produce results. With the current
spread rate of COVID-19, this is not acceptable. Further, the limited number
of test kits makes this situation even more serious (Shan et al., 2020; Narin
et al., 2020). Recent studies show that the RT-PCR suffering from low sensitivity and low accuracy, repeated entries are required (Long et al., 2020; Ai et al.,
2020). This infers that patients will not be able to be confirmed on time which
increases the potential risk of spreading.
In order to address these challenges, scientists around the world are trying to develop new diagnostic systems. Some studies (Bernheim et al., 2020;
Li and Xia, 2020) have demonstrated that chest computed tomography (CT)
imaging can help in diagnosing COVID-19 rapidly. Salehi et al. (Salehi et al.,
1 https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports

2

2020) concluded that chest CT imaging is sensitive when diagnosing COVID-19
even when patients do not have clinical symptoms. Specifically, three typical
radiographic features including consolidation, pleural effusion and ground class
opacification can be easily observed (Huang et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Shi
et al., 2020a) on COVID-19 patients CT images.
With this in mind, several methods based on chest CT images been developed
for diagnosing COVID-19. For instance, Butt et al. (Butt et al., 2020) adopted
a convolutional neural Network (CNN) to classifier patient’s CT images. In
addition, there are a few works use the 3D CNN to conduct the diagnosis of
COVID-19 as well based on chest CT scans (Gozes et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020;
Zheng et al., 2020). Mei et al. (Mei et al., 2020) adopted the ResNet to conduct
the rapid diagnosis of the COVID-19. Besides the diagnosis, lots of works are
using the segmentation technique to conduct the detection (Chen et al., 2020a;
Shi et al., 2020b; Chen et al., 2020d). All those existing methods are trained
based on the limited available samples which have small number of patients and
may not have capability to generalize to new patients. It is well-known that, the
lack of labelled training data is the common problem, while deep learning based
methods generally require a large volume of data to accurately train the models.
Many research efforts have been sought for alleviating this problem such as data
augmentation or through generative adversarial network (GAN) (Zhao et al.,
2019; Akkus et al., 2017; Oliveira et al., 2017; Pereira et al., 2016).However, these
methods are highly sensitive with the parameter selection. Hand-tuned data
augmentation methods like rotation may lead to over-fitting (Eaton-Rosen et al.,
2018) and the generated images by GAN can not simulate the real patient which
may introduce unpredictable bias in testing phase (Zhao et al., 2019). Recently,
few-shot learning has been attracting much attention in medical image analysis.
In general, few-shot learning aims to leverage existing data to classify new tasks
from similar domains. The basic workflow for few-shot learning is first pretraining an embedding network on a large dataset (e.g. ImageNet) and then finetuning the weights of this network, finally applying it into a unseen small dataset
(He et al., 2020). However, the performance is limitedly improved. One reason
3

lies in the ImageNet contains a broad range of categories of images and pre-train
on ImageNet usually might bring in unrelevant information, so as not to learn
a effective embeddings for improving lung-specific feature representation. On
the other hand, pre-training on ImageNet causes high computational cost, for
example, ImageNet-1B normally required more than 50 GPU days.
To address this challenge, we develop an end-to-end trainable deep few-shot
learning framework to make an accurate prediction with minimal training Chest
CT Images. Specifically, we fist use the instance discrimination task to enforce
model to discriminate two images are the same instance or not. We generate
different views of the same images to augment the original dataset. As the goal
at this stage is increasing variances other than discrimination, we can avoid the
disadvantages of data augmentation mentioned previously.
We then deploy a self-supervised strategy (Oord et al., 2018) powered with
momentum contrastive training to further boost the performance. The key idea
is to build a dynamic dictionary to perform key, query look-up where the keys
are sampled from data and encoded by the encoder. However, the key in dictionary is noisy and inconsistent due to the back-propagation (He et al., 2019).
The momentum mechanism is applied to mitigate this effect by updating key
encoder and query encoder in different scales. Finally, we utilized two public
lung datasets to pre-train an embedding network and employ the prototypical
network (Snell et al., 2017) to conduct the few-shot classification, which learns
a metric space where the classification can be performed by measuring the distances to the derived prototypical representation of each class. The extensive
experiments on two new datasets demonstrate that our model provides a promising tool for quick COVID-19 diagnosis with very limited available training data.

2. Problem Definition
Due to the shortage of the annotated COVID-19 CT images, the normal classification methods may not able to work properly. Based on that, we formulate
the COVID-19 diagnosis problem as a few-shot classification problem. The few-

4

shot learning is designed for the case which only a few samples available in a new
class on a classification task. The few-shot learning can be defined as a M -way,
C-shot episodic task (Vinyals et al., 2016) where M represents the number of
classes and C represents number of samples available for each class. The training
set which never seen before can be represented as D = {(x0 , y0 ), · · · , (xd , yM )},
d is the number of samples in this dataset. We randomly selected the support
set and query set from D: i) The support set S can be partially or fully made up
of M classes but only contain C +1 samples each. ii) We randomly select 1 sample from the C + 1 samples to form the test set (query set). Hence, COVID-19
diagnosis can be represented as a two-way, C-shot learning problem.

3. Methodology
In this section, we will introduce our proposed self-supervised COVID-19
diagnosis method. The overall flowchart is illustrated in Fig. 1. We will describe
the three major components of our method which include data augmentation,
representation learning and the few-shot classification.
3.1. Data Augmentation
Data augmentation has been widely used in unsupervised representation
learning and supervised learning (Parkhi et al., 2012; Donahue and Simonyan,
2019; Donahue et al., 2014). A few existing approaches define the contrastive
classification task as changing abd image’s structure. For instance, Hjelm et
al. (Hjelm et al., 2018) and Bachman et al. (Bachman et al., 2019) used globalto-local view for contrastive learning as shown in the first example in Fig 2.
Meanwhile, Oord et al. (Oord et al., 2018) and Henaff et al. (Hénaff et al.,
2019) achieved neighbor prediction using the adjacency view (middle example,
Fig 2). Those two methods can be view on the first two images on 2. Besides,
we also introduce the over-lapping view which is the third image on Fig 2.
In this study, we apply a stochastic data augmentation T which will randomly transfer a given example image x into two different views denoted as

xi , xj . We consider the pair xi , xj as positive. In this study, we apply two
simple augmentation strategies in sequence: 1) random cropping, followed by
a resizing operation back to the original size with random flipping. 2) random
cropping with color distortions followed by a resizing operation. When a new
image is fed into the model, one of the above methods to perform is randomly selected for augmentation. This process is repeated twice to generate two different
views.
Note that we implement color distortions using the torchvision2 package in
PyTorch (Paszke et al., 2019).

A, C, E views will have random color distortions applied while B, D, F will not change if the
method (2) is chosen. All the cropped sections will be resized back to the original input image
size. For the instance discrimination task, the goal, given B, D, F,is to, determine whether or
not A, C, E are in the same instances.

3.2. Contrastive Visual Embedding
Using contrastive learning to learn visual embeddings was first explored by
Hadsell et al. (Hadsell et al., 2006). The task can be defined as: Given an
image set {I = i1 , · · · , ip }, xi ∈ Rd , the goal is to find a mapping function
G : Rd 7→ Ra , a  d to satisfy:
s(G(x), G(x+ )  s(G(x), G(x− )

(1)

where s(·, ·) is a function used to measure the similarity between two inputs. G
is designed for dimension reduction and representation learning. Finally, x+ , x−
represent the positive and negative samples which means x+ being similar to x
and x− dissimilar. It is worth to mentioned that, the contrastive learning is a
type of unsupervised learning. A simple framework for the contrastive learning
was proposed by Chen et al. (Chen et al., 2020b). The framework learns the
representations by maximizing the agreement between differently augmented
views xi , xj of the same data example x via a contrastive loss in the latent space.
We adopt this framework in our model. Specifically,our representation learning
stage consists of three modules: encoder, projection head and the contrastive
loss function.
Encoder. The neural network based encoder f (·) can extract representations
from the augmented images. This framework is flexible to adopt any type of
7

network architecture without constraints. In this study, we adopt ResNet (He
et al., 2016) to obtain the representation hi , hj , hi = f (xi ) = ResNet(xi ) where
hi is the Rd output of the average pooling layer.
Projection Head. The project head g(·) is a function that can map the
resulting representation int oapplication space of the contrastive loss. The most
common projection head used is the multilayer perceptron (MLP) with one
hidden layer (Chen et al., 2020b,c). In this case, we can express the zi (as well
as zj ) as:
zi = g(hi ) = W 2 σ(W 1 hi )

(2)

where W 1 , W 2 are the weights of the hidden layer and output layer respectively.
The σ(·) is the non-liner ReLU activation function which can be defined as:


0 x ≤ 0
(3)
ReLU(x) =

x x > 0
We will examine the effectiveness of this projection head in Section 4.
Contrastive Loss Function. The contrastive loss function is defined for the
contrastive pre-text task. We only consider the instance discrimination task (Wu
et al., 2018) in this study. Given a set {xk } including a positive pair xi , xj , the
contrastive task aims to identify xj in set {xk }k6=i for a given xi .
We define the contrastive task on pairs of augmented images from a randomly
selected minibatch with N samples. The augmentation process results in 2N
data points. To create the contrastive task, we need enough negative samples
to construct the loss function. Similar to Chen et al. (Doersch and Zisserman,
2017), we treat the other 2N − 2 examples as the negative samples. The similarity function s(·, ·) can be defined as the cosine similarity:
s(v, u) =

v| u
kvkkuk

(4)

where v, u are two vectors. Based on this, we can define the loss function for a
pair of positive samples (i, j) as:
Li,j = − log P2N

exp(s(zi , zj )/τ )

k=1

1k6=i exp(s(zi , zk )/τ )
8

(5)

Here 1k6=i ∈ {0, 1} is the indicator which have value of 1 when k 6= i and
0 otherwise, and τ is the temperature parameter. This loss is known as the
normalized temperature-scaled cross entropy loss (Sohn, 2016; Bachman et al.,
2019; Oord et al., 2018). However, Eq.(5) only considers the positive samples
and ignores negative samples. This may lead to potential bias. To avoid this,
we introduce the momentum mechanism into our model.
Contrastive learning can also be expressed as training an encoder to conduct
a dictionary lookup task. Consider an encoded query q and encoded samples
xi , ..., xk which are the keys of the dictionary. If the query q is similar to the
sample x+ this means there is a match. For the negative samples x− , there is
no match in the dictionary. Based on this definition, He et al. proposed an
unsupervised learning-based framework MoCo (He et al., 2019), by adopting
contrastive learning.
Based on the above definition, the goal of contrastive learning is to build a
discrete dictionary for high-dimensional continuous inputs. The core of MoCo
is maintaining a dictionary with a queue. The benefit of this is that the encoder can reuse the encoded keys from the previous mini-batch. In addition,
the dictionary can be much larger than the mini-batch and easy to adjust. As
the number of samples that can be included in the dictionary is fixed, once the
dictionary is full, it will progressively remove the oldest records. In this way, the
consistency of the dictionary can be maintained as the oldest samples are often
out-of-date and inconsistent with the new entries. Another approach, called
Memory Bank (Wu et al., 2018), tries to store the historical records of the encoded samples. This approach maintains a bank of all the representations of the
dataset. The dictionary then randomly samples from the memory bank directly
for each mini-batch without back-propagation. However, this method will lead
to inconsistency when sampling. To overcome this, back-propagation should be
conducted to keep the sampling step up-to-date. A simple solution is to copy
the key encoder fk from query encoder fq without the gradient. However, the
encoder changes constantly which can lead to a noisy key representation and
poor results. The momentum contrast was address to relief this problem, using
9

a different method to update the gradient for fk :
θk ←
− mθk + (1 − m)θq .

(6)

where θk is the parameter for fk , θq is the parameter for fq and m ∈ [0, 1) is the
momentum coefficient. We use the back-propagation to update the parameter
θq and use Eq.(6) to update θk . Benefiting from the momentum coefficient, the
θk ’s update is smoother than θq . Based on the different update strategies, the
query and key will be encoded by different encoders eventually.
Based on the above discussion, we use the dictionary as a queue to allow
the encoder to reuse the previous encoded sample. The loss function for the
pre-trained model can be written as:
L = − log

exp(q, k + )/τ
P
.
+ k− exp(q, k − )/τ

exp(q, k + )/τ

(7)

Different from Eq.(5), here we need to consider the queue and the negative cases,
so we slightly modify the loss function to fulfil this requirement by introducing
the positive examples k + and negative examples k − , where qk = k + ∪ k − . In
the instance discrimination pre-text task, a positive pair is formed when a query
q and a key k are augmented from the same sample; otherwise, a negative pair
is created. Once the pre-training step is finished, we extract the pre-trained
encoder f (·) and integrate it into our classification module.
3.3. Prototypical Network for Few-Shot Classification
Another step in our workflow is classification. In this stage, meta-learning is
applied to fine-tune the pre-trained encoder to fit the class changes required by
few-shot learning. Then we use the Prototypical Networks (Snell et al., 2017) to
conduct the few-shot classification. The prototypical network learns an embedding that maps all inputs into a mean vector c in the latent space to represent
each class. The goal of the pre-trained encoder is to similar images close and
dissimilar images separate in the latent space. The prototypical network has a
similar aim so it to fine-tune our pre-trained encoder. For class m, the centroid

10

embedding features can be written as:
cm =

1
|S|

X

ψ(xd )

(8)

(xd ,yM )∈S

where ψ(·) is the embedding function from the prototypical network. As the
prototypical network is a metric based learning method, we use the Euclidean
distance to produce the distribution for all classes for a query q.
exp(−d(ψ(q), cm ))
.
0
m0 exp(−d(ψ(q), cm )

p(y = m|q) = P

(9)

Eq.(9) is based on the softmax function over the distance between a query set’s
embedding and the features of the class. The loss function for this stage can be
defined as:
Lmeta = d(ψ(q), cm ) + log(d(ψ(q), cm0 ))

(10)

3.4. Training Strategy
Algorithm 1 shows the whole pre-training workflow of our model.

4. Experiments
4.1. Datasets
We evaluate our proposed model using two publicly available annotated
COVID-19 CT image datasets: (1) COVID-19 CT provided by Zhao et al. (Zhao
et al., 2020) and (2) a dataset provided by the Italian Society of Medical and
Interventional Radiology3 , processed by MedSeg4 . The proposed model requires
proper pre-training. Different from existing methods like Self-Trans (He et al.,
2020) that use the ImageNet to pre-train the model, we use DeepLesion (Yan
et al., 2018) and the Lung Image Database Consortium Image Collection (LIDCIDRI)5 to pre-train our model. DeepLesion contains over 32,000 lung CT images, while LIDC-IDRI has 244,617. Both datasets are public datasets and

focus on lung diseases. We use those two datasets without labels to pre-train
the encoder network.
When dividing the support and query sets for classification, we divide the
dataset at a patient-level instead of CT level to avoid any possible over-fitting.
We report the basic statistics for the COVID-19 CT dataset and MegSeg in
Table 1.
We combine the two datasets for testing. Note that all CT images were resized
to 512 × 512 using opencv26 .

4.2. Experimental Settings
For pre-training, we use the SGD optimizer with a weight decay of 0.0001 and
momentum of 0.9. The momentum update coefficient is 0.999. The mini-batch
size is set to 256 in eight GPUs. The initial learning rate is 0.03. The number
of epochs is 200, and the learning rate is multiplied by 0.1 after 120 and 160
epochs, as described in (Wu et al., 2018). The encoder is ResNet-50. The twolayer MLP projection head has a 2048-D hidden layer with a ReLU activation
function. The weights are initialized using He initialization (He et al., 2015),
and the temperature parameter τ is set to 0.07. For the classification stage,
we follow the default settings of the prototypical net. The experiments were
conducted on eight GPUS which includes six NVIDIA TITAN X Pascal GPUs
and two NVIDIA TITAN RTX.
4.3. Evaluation and Results
We evaluate our approach by using four metrics: i) Accuracy, which measures the percentage of correctly classified samples over the whole dataset; ii)
Precision, which measures the percentage of true positives (TP) over all predicted positive samples; iii) Recall, used to measure the percentage of TPs over
all positive samples; and iv) Area-under-the-curve (AUC) which measures the
relation between FPs and TPs. For fair comparison, we train and test all baseline methods on COVID-19 CT and MegSeg dataset directly by using 10-fold
cross-validation at a patient-level with cross-entropy loss function. The results
are shown in in Table 2. We find that two-way, one-shot method achieves very
similar result to the ResNet-50 trained on the COVID-19 dataset. In addition,

we also provide the visualization of the learned feature on figure3. As aforementioned, our method is based on few-shot learning. We are interested in how
the number of shots affect model’s performance. Based on that, we conduct a
few experiments to explore the relationship between the performance and the
number of shots. We use the ResNet-50 as the baseline methods. The results

It is not hard to find that when the number of shots increasing, the performance
increasing gradually. Specifically, when the number of shots is larger than 3,
the result of our model is better then that of ResNet-50. These results show
indicate that the pre-trained encoder can capture the features from unknown
images very well.
4.4. Ablation Study
In this section, we conduct the ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of each component. The default setting is two-way, one-shot and the
ResNet-50 use the same setting as previous section. In summary, we want to
answer the following research questions: 1) What if pre-trained was conducted
on ImageNet? 2) How data augmentation and projection head affect the performance? 3)How important of the fine-tuning stage?
15

First, we are interested in the pre-training dataset selection. We thus conduct
the experiments again using ImageNet for pre-training on default setting. The
results can be found in Table 4. As expected, we find that the performance

is worse when the model is pre-trained by ImageNet. As discussed before, an
extra step may be required to conduct transfer learning from common items to

Next, we discover the role of the data augmentation and projection head
played in our model. We’ve conducted the experiments on our model without
projection head and without augmentation. The result can be found in Table 5.
As we can see, the data augmentation have the significant effect with the result

and the projection head can boost the performance. Finally, we want to examine
the effect of the fine-tuning process. To investigate this problem, we first pretrain the embedding network and make some modifications with the few-shot
classification stage by replace the prototypical network with frozen features
liner classifier. The frozen features linear classifier means we directly apply the
linear classifier into the learned embedding network without any weights update
procedure. Result can be found in Table 6.

5. Conclusion
Nowadays, CT imaging attracts more and more attention as a screening tool
for diagnosing COVID-19. It provides a visualization for community to monitor
patient’s progression and can help to evaluate the severity of COVID-19 (Shan
et al., 2020). However, the lack of the annotated CT scans are the biggest
challenge. In this study, we proposed a new deep-learning based method which
can be used for automatic screening of COVID-19 with limited samples. And it
proved that such method achieves superior performance than ResNet-50 when
the number of available samples is larger than three. ResNet is a well-known
and widely used supervised learning model on medical image area. As a selfsupervised method which belongs to unsupervised learning field, the results are
better than ResNet would be remarkable.
