ABSTRACT
Objective: We aim at developing a hybrid model for earlier and more accurate predictions for the
number of infected cases in pandemics by (1) using patients' claims data from different counties and
states that capture local disease status and medical resource utilization; (2) utilizing demographic
similarity and geographical proximity between locations; and (3) integrating pandemic transmission
dynamics into a deep learning model.
Materials and Methods: We proposed a Spatio-Temporal Attention Network (STAN) for pandemic
prediction. It uses a graph attention network to capture spatio-temporal trends of disease dynamics
and to predict the number of cases for a fixed number of days into the future. We also designed a
dynamics-based loss term for enhancing long-term predictions. STAN was tested using both realworld patient claims data and COVID-19 statistics over time across the US counties.
Results: STAN outperforms traditional epidemiological models such as Susceptible-InfectiousRecovered (SIR), Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR), and deep learning models on
both long-term and short-term predictions, achieving up to 87% reduction in mean squared error
compared to the best baseline prediction model.
Conclusions: By combining information from real-world claims data and disease case counts data,
STAN can better predict disease status and medical resource utilization.
Keywords: pandemic prediction, deep learning, graph attention network

OBJECTIVE
Pandemic diseases such as the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been spreading
rapidly across the world and poses a severe threat to global public health. Up to July 2020, COVID19 has affected 14.1 million people and caused more than 597K deaths over the world[1], and caused
significant disruption to people's daily life as well as substantial economic losses. Therefore, it is
critical to predict the pandemic outbreak early and accurately to help design appropriate policies
and reduce losses.
Many epidemiological models (e.g., susceptible-infected-removed (SIR), susceptible-exposedinfected-removed (SEIR)), and deep learning models (e.g., Long Short Term Memory networks LSTM) have been applied to predict the COVID-19 pandemic [1-4]. However, they face three major
challenges: (1) They usually build a separate model for each location (e.g., one model per county)
without incorporating geographic proximity and interactions with nearby regions. Or the forecasts
only depend on some observed patterns from other locations[2, 3], while inter-regional interactions
are not directly modeled. In fact, a location often shows similar disease patterns with its nearby
locations or demographically similar locations due to population movements or demographic
similarity [5]. (2) Existing models are mainly built on COVID-19 case report data. These data are
known to have severe under-reporting or other data quality issues. (3) Epidemiological models such
as SIR and SEIR are deterministic models. They use a set of differential equations to fit the entire
curve of disease counts. These models are determined by only a few parameters, making them
unable to capture complex short-term patterns such as superinfection or time-varying infectivity[4].
Conversely, deep learning-based models can only predict known data patterns and lead to accurate
predictions only within a short time period. Therefore, while there are techniques that allow for
either short-term or long-term predictive models of disease outbreaks, existing models do not
provide accurate models over both time horizons.
In this work, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Attention Network (STAN) for pandemic
prediction using real-world evidence such as claims data and COVID-19 case surveillance data. We
map locations (e.g., a county or a state) to nodes on a graph and construct the edges based on
geographical proximity and demographic similarity between locations. Each node is associated with
a set of static and dynamic features extracted from multiple real-world evidence in medical claims
data that capture disease prevalence at different locations and medical resource utilization conditions.
We utilize a graph attention network (GAT) to incorporate interactions of similar locations. Then
we predict the number of infected patients for a fixed period into the future while concurrently
imposing physical constraints on predictions according to transmission dynamics of
epidemiological models. We apply STAN to predict both state-level and county-level future number
of infected cases, achieving up to 87% reduction in mean squared error compared to the best baseline
model. The study has been determined by the UIUC IRB as non-human subject research.

BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE
Epidemic/Pandemic Prediction Models
Traditional epidemic prediction models use compartmental based models that estimate disease
transmission dynamics at the population level, such as SIR, SEIR models, and their variants[2, 3].
Some works also utilize time series learning approaches for pandemic prediction, for example,

applying curve-fitting[3] or autoregression[5]. Besides these traditional statistical models, deep
learning models were developed to cast epidemic or pandemic modeling as time series prediction
problems. Many works [6-8] combines deep neural networks (DNN) with causal models for
influenza-like illness (ILI) incidence forecasting. Deng et al.[9] proposed a graph message passing
framework to combine learned feature embeddings and an attention matrix to model disease
propagation over time. Yang et al.[3] used previous pandemic data to pretrain the LSTM, and then
apply it to predict COVID-19 progression in China. Kapoor et al.[10] utilize a simple graph neural
network for COVID-19 prediction. However, these models only predict the next day instead of longterm progression. It is still challenging to make deep-based models achieve good long-term
prediction performance. Moreover, DNN-based methods have a significant issue: they can only
predict known trends from the input data without understanding the long-term progression trend.
For example, at the early stage of the pandemic if all case counts are increasing, it is unlikely for
these models to predict a declining trend in future. Hence the long-term prediction is often difficult
for DNN models.

Incorporate Disease Transmission Dynamics in Graph Neural
Network
Recently, several studies have attempted to incorporate knowledge about physical systems into
deep learning. For example, Wu et al. and Beucler et al.[11, 12] introduced statistical and physical
constraints in the loss function to regularize the model's predictions. However, their studies only
focused on spatial modeling without temporal dynamics. Seo et al.[13, 14] integrates physical laws
into graph neural networks. However, they focused on using physical laws to optimize node-edge
transitions instead of concentrating on prediction results. In particular, those models only predict
graph signals for the next time point instead of long-term outcomes. In our work, we also incorporate
physics laws, i.e., disease transmission dynamics, to regularize model predictions to overcome the
limitations of the prior models. These regularizations will be applied over a time range to ensure we
can predict long-term pandemic progression. Since our proposed method is applied to extracted
temporal and spatial embeddings of locations as an extra loss term, it does not introduce extra hyperparameters; hence it is easier to train.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Problem Formulation
In this paper, we develop the model STAN to predict the number of COVID-19 cases for a
fixed number of days into the future, at a county or state level across the USA. STAN takes the
following input data: county-level historical daily numbers of positive cases, county-level
population-related statistics, and the frequencies of relevant medical codes extracted from medical
claims data. Our goal is to better predict the number of cases by utilizing the rich information
captured by these different data sources.
Throughout the paper, we use 𝑁 to denote the number of spatial locations (counties), 𝑿 to
represent the feature matrix of size 𝑁 × (𝐹! + 𝑇 × 𝐹" ) where 𝐹! is the number of static features
per county (or state) and 𝐹" is the number of dynamic features for each county (or state). 𝑇
denotes the total number of time steps (i.e., days) for each location. Finally, we are interested in

predicting 𝐼(𝑡), the number of infected patients at the 𝑡 #$ time step for all the locations.
As depicted in Figure 1, STAN is enabled by the following components: 1) a graph neural
network that captures the geographic trends in disease transmission; 2) an RNN that captures the
temporal disease patterns at each location; 3) Both short-term prediction loss and long-term
transmission dynamics constraint loss to regularize learned hidden representations of node
embeddings. We describe each of these aspects below.

Figure 1. The STAN model: We construct the location graph using location-wise dynamic and
static features as nodes and geographic proximity as edges. The graph is fed into graph attention
network to extract spatio-temporal features and learn the graph embedding for the target location.
Then the graph embedding is fed into the GRU to extract temporal relationships. The hidden states
of GRU will be used to predict future number of infected and recovered cases. We use an
additional transmission dynamics loss based on pandemic transmission dynamics to optimize the
model.

(I). Graph Construction
The input data includes dynamic data and static data. Dynamic data is a 3D tensor that includes
location (e.g., states, counties, etc.), timestamp (e.g., days/weeks), and the dynamic features at each
location (e.g., the number of active COVID-19 cases and the numbers of other related ICD codes).
Static data is a 2D matrix that includes location and the static features for each location. We also
form an attributed graph to capture the spatio-temporal epidemic/pandemic dynamics. In
particular, we model the geographic proximity and demographic similarity between the different
locations as edges in a location graph.
Graph nodes: We construct an attributed graph 𝐺(𝒱, ℰ) to represent the input data. A
location is modeled as a graph node and is associated with a feature matrix that contains both static
and dynamic features across all the time stamps for that location. In total, we have 193 nodes for
the county level graph (one for each county with more than 1,000 infected cases) or 45 nodes for
the state level graph (one for each state).
Graph edges: The edges are constructed based on geographical proximity and the population
sizes of the nodes (i.e., locations). In particular, we designate the weight of an edge between nodes
(

𝑖 and 𝑗 as 𝑤%& ∝ 𝑝%' 𝑝& 𝑒𝑥𝑝 7−

)!"
*

9 where 𝑝% and 𝑝& are the population size of the nodes, 𝑑%&

is the geographical distance between them, 𝛼, 𝛽 and 𝑟 are hyperparameters. The above model is
based on the idea that disease transmission patterns highly depend on crowd mobility. If there is a

high mobility rate between a pair of nodes, we expect that the nodes have the similar disease spread
parameters. Hence, our process includes an edge with a large weight between such a pair of nodes.
Note that the distance parameter 𝑑%& can incorporate any general notion of distance, including
inverse of the volume of air and car travels.
Node features (static): Each node 𝑛% has an associated static feature vector of size 4,
consisting of the static features including latitude, longitude, population size, and population density.
Node features (dynamic) – Each node 𝑛% also has a set of dynamic features in the form of a
matrix. The dynamic features include the number of active cases, total cases, the current number of
hospitalizations and ICU stays due to COVID-19, which are calculated by aggregating the related
procedure codes. We also include the number of each of the 48 COVID-19 related diagnosis codes
extracted from claims data according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guideline
(https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/icd/COVID-19-guidelines-final.pdf). We outline the specific
diagnosis codes used in the description of the dataset.

(II). Modeling Spatio-temporal Patterns using Graph Attention
Networks
Obtaining the complex spatial dependencies is a crucial problem to pandemic prediction. By
utilizing spatial similarity, our model can make more accurate predictions of a location by
considering similar locations' disease transmission status. Here we employ the Graph Attention
Networks (GAT) model[15] to extract spatio-temporal similarity features. The basic idea of GAT is
updating the embedding of each node by aggregating its neighboring nodes. In our setting, each
location will receive information from its adjacent locations based on mobility to model spatiotemporal disease transmission patterns. This consideration is based on the real-world scenario that
adjacent locations may have different impacts on the infectious status of the focused location. For
example, if one city has a large population size and increasing infected cases, this city may have a
more considerable impact on its adjacent counties.
We use a two-layer GAT to extract spatio-temporal features from the attributed graph. We use
the latest values from historical data within a sliding window to construct the graph. Mathematically,
at time step 𝑡, the input features to node 𝑖 are 𝑿%# , where 𝑿%# ∈ ℝ+#(-$.-%) and 𝐿0 denotes the
length of the input window. Intuitively at the 𝑡-th timestep, we concatenate historical features (i.e.,
𝐿0 days of features) as input. The longer the 𝐿0 is, the more historical information and patterns the
model will use. Then we apply the graph attention mechanism and calculate the node representation
𝒛%# ∈ ℝ-& for each node, where 𝐹1 denotes the output dimension of the GAT layer.
Concretely, to calculate the 𝒛%# , we use the multi-head mechanism to calculate 𝐾 independent
attention scores following the self-attention strategy[16]. A multi-head attention mechanism can
help the model get more accurate predictions by generating different attention weights. Intuitively
different attention heads may focus on different features in the graph to more comprehensively
model the locations. The attention weight of the 𝑘-th head between two nodes 𝑖 and 𝑗 as:
&

𝑒%&2 = 𝜎(𝐖32 (𝐖12 𝑿%# |𝐖12 𝑿# ))
!

where 𝐖12 ∈ ℝ-&×|𝑿'| denotes the linear transformation weight matrix for the 𝑘-th head, which
will transform the input to the output dimension. 𝐖32 ∈ ℝ7×8-& represents the attention
computation matrix for the 𝑘-th head, (∙ | ∙) denotes the vector concatenation. 𝜎 is the non-linear

activation function, and here we use the leaky rectified linear function (LeakyReLU):
𝜎(𝑥) = K

𝑥, 𝑖𝑓 𝑥 ≥ 0
0.01𝑥, 𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑤𝑖𝑠𝑒

which is the same as the original GAT model[15].
Next we use the softmax function to calculate the attention score:
exp\𝑒%&2 ]
2
𝑎%&
= softmax\𝑒%&2 ] = :
2
∑9;7 exp\𝑒%9
]
Each edge of node i will receive an attention score, which assesses how much information should
be aggregated from neighboring node j. Finally, we sum up all embedding vectors from multiple
heads to obtain the final representation 𝒛%# for node 𝑖 as:
<

𝒛%#

:

2

𝐖12 𝑿%#
𝐾
2;7 &;7

where N denotes the number of locations.

(III). Modeling Temporal Features using Recurrent Neural Networks
Pandemic prediction is not only spatial-related, but also a temporal-related task. The graph
information will change along with time. We want to model the spatio-temporal patterns to better
predict future trends. We first use the MaxPooling operator, which is to select the maximum value
in each column of a matrix to reduce the dimension, to generate embedding for the entire graph as:
𝒛b# = MaxPool([𝒛=# , 𝒛7# , … , 𝒛:
# ])
= 7
:
where [𝒛# , 𝒛# , … , 𝒛# ] is a matrix and the i-th column is 𝒛%# , thus 𝒛b# incorporates the most
important features of all nodes extracted from the graph.
On the same day, the pandemic may have just emerged for some locations, but for other
locations, the pandemic may have reached the peak. So we cannot model temporal patterns for all
locations simultaneously using the same model parameters. We build a different model for each
location. These locations share the same model structure and graph structure but have different
model parameters. The STAN model is an end-to-end model, which means each location's model
will adaptively extract most related spatio-temporal patterns from the attributed graph. All following
equations are for one specific location, and we omit location index 𝑖 to reduce clutter.
We input the graph embedding to Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)[17] network to learn temporal
features. GRU is a type of recurrent neural networks, which can effectively model temporal
sequences and is also widely used in many sequence analysis tasks[18, 19]. The GRU's hidden state
is calculated as:
𝒉# = 𝐺𝑅𝑈(𝒛
l,
l,
b# )
7 𝒛
8 …,𝒛
The obtained hidden state of the GRU 𝒉# at the 𝑡-th timestep for a specific location contains
both spatial and temporal patterns learned from real-world data.

(IV). Multi-task Prediction and Transmission Dynamics Inspired
Loss function
Our objective is to predict the number of infected cases for both long-term and short-term. In
our method, we tackle this issue by using a multi-task learning framework to consider short-term
and long-term prediction performance jointly.

Figure 2. STAN prediction process for a single location at day 5 with 𝐿0 = 3 and 𝐿> = 5.
The idea is to use short-term prediction loss and long-term transmission dynamics constraint
loss to regularize learned hidden representations of node embeddings (i.e., hidden state of the GRU)
𝒉# . In Figure 2, we provide the model prediction process for a single location on day 5 (the input
window 𝐿0 = 3). Since the prediction process is the same for each timestep, we will omit the time
index 𝑡 for simplicity. Concretely, the model output consists of two parts:
1. Transmission/Recovery rate. The traditional SIR-based model assumes that the disease
transmission/recovery rate 𝛽 and 𝛾 remain constant time. But in practice, those rates may
easily change over time due to policies or disease evolution reasons. To solve this issue, we
define a prediction window 𝐿> that the 𝛽 and 𝛾 will be specific for this window. In Figure
2, 𝐿> = 5 and the prediction window start from day 6 and end on day 10. The model will
predict 𝛽 and 𝛾 for the prediction window as:
𝛽, 𝛾 = sigmoid(MLP(𝒉))
where MLP(⋅) denotes the multi-layer perceptron, and we use sigmoid activation since both
𝛽 and 𝛾 are between 0 and 1.
2. Daily increased number of infected/recovered cases. For the 𝑖-th prediction window, the
w and Δ𝑹
w
model will predict the increment of the number of infected and recovered cases Δ𝑰
as:
w, Δ𝑹
w = MLP(𝒉)
Δ𝑰
w and Δ𝑹
w are vectors since we are predicting for 𝐿> days.
Note that Δ𝑰
To optimize the model parameters, we design two loss terms to make the model predict better
for both short-term and long-term progression. Concretely, the loss function also consists of two
parts:
1. Transmission dynamics constraint loss. The first loss term is a transmission dynamics
constraint loss to regularize long-term prediction trends. In this term, we do not directly
optimize the predictions using the ground truth numbers. Instead, we hope the model can use
pandemic dynamics to regularize longer progressions. In particular, we use the predicted
w ) and Δ𝑹
w ).
transmission/recovery rate 𝛽 and 𝛾 to compute dynamic-based predictions Δ𝑰
Then we can optimize the learned 𝛽 and 𝛾 by optimizing these dynamic-based predictions,.
Concretely, based on the SIR differential equations, give the prediction window in Figure 2,

we can calculate the transmission dynamics-based increment number of infected cases and
recovered cases iteratively as:

example), 𝑁> denotes the population size of the current location and in Figure 2, 𝑡 = 5 since
we are making predictions at the 5-th time step. Finally, the transmission dynamics constraint
loss is calculated as:

w ) − Δ𝑰]8 + \Δ𝑹
w ) − Δ𝑹]8
ℒ) = \Δ𝑰
where 𝑰# and 𝑹# denote the ground truth number of infected and recovered cases. This loss
term calculates the mean squared error of transmission dynamics-based predictions in order to
make the prediction results in line with the long-term trend of pandemics.
2. Prediction loss. The second loss term is a regular mean squared error loss for the second task:
w − Δ𝑰]8 + \Δ𝑹
w − Δ𝑹]8
ℒ* = \Δ𝑰
this loss term is to make the prediction results as close as possible to the short-term variation.
By combining two loss terms, the final loss function can be calculated by summing up all
locations and timesteps as:
A

ℒ = a a(ℒ* + ℒ) )

(V). Prediction with STAN
Once the model is trained, we can use the trained model to predict COVID cases at all locations
given the length of input window 𝐿0 , the length of prediction window 𝐿B , and graph information
𝐺 as input. Assuming our data is collected between 𝑡7 and 𝑡8 , first, the graph information between
𝑡7 and 𝑡8 is fed into GAT to generate the graph embedding. Then the graph embeddings are fed
into GRU. At the last time timestep of the GRU, the model will output predicted daily increased
w, Δ𝑹
w ) for future 𝐿B days after 𝑡8 . Then we can
number of infected and recovered cases (i.e., Δ𝑰
calculate the total infected cases number by summing up the increased number. Note that we do not
use the transmission dynamics constraints in the prediction time because this module is only used
for optimizing the model in training time. We can obtain longer predictions by using a larger
prediction window 𝐿> or adding the latest graph data incrementally.

EXPERIMENTS
Dataset Description
In this paper, we used a US county-level dataset that consists of COVID-19 related data from
two resources: Johns Hopkins University (JHU) Coronavirus Resource Center[20] and IQVIA's
claims data[21]. The data from JHU Coronavirus Resource Center was collected from March 22,

2020 to June 10, 2020. It has the number of active cases, confirmed cases, and deaths related to
COVID-19 for different US locations. We select states with more than 1,000 confirmed cases by
May 17 to ensure the data source accuracy, and finally we have 45 states and 193 counties in the
dataset. For those counties, we set the number of cases before their respective first record dates as
zero. The IQVIA's claims data is from the IQVIA US9 Database. We export patient claims data and
prescription data from March 22, 2020 to June 10, 2020, from which we obtain the number of
hospital and ICU visits and the term-frequency of each medical code per county per day. Detailed
dataset descriptions are shown in Supplementary. The dataset has records for a total of 453,089
patients across the entire timespan of the JHU dataset. The 48 unique ICD-10 codes related to
COVID-19 are listed in the Supplementary Material.

Baseline Models
We compare STAN with the following baselines.
1. SIR: the susceptible-infected-removed (SIR), a basic disease transmission model that uses
differential equations to simulate an epidemic. S, I, and R represent the number of susceptible,
infected, and recovered individuals.
2. SEIR: the susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) epidemiological model as another
transmission dynamics constraint-based baselines. Compared to the SIR model, SEIR adds
exposed population size to the equation.
3. GRU[17]: We input the latest number of infected cases into a naïve GRU and predict future
numbers.
4. ColaGNN[9]: ColaGNN uses a location graph to extract spatial relationships for predicting
pandemics. Different from STAN, graph nodes in ColaGNN only consist of time series of
numbers of infected cases.
5. CovidGNN[10]: CovidGNN uses a graph neural network with skip connections to predict
pandemics. They use the graph embedding to predict the future number of cases without using
RNN to extract temporal relationships.
To explore the performance enhancement by transmission dynamics constraints and graph
structures, we also compare STAN with the following reduced models.
1. STAN-PC removes transmission dynamics constraints from STAN.
2. STAN-Graph removes the GCN layers and graph data from STAN.
The implementation details of all models are shown in Supplementary Material.

Tasks and Evaluation Strategy
We predict the future number of active cases on both county-level and state-level. To evaluate
the ability of STAN for both long-term predictions and short-term predictions, we set the prediction
window 𝐿> to 5, 15, and 20, i.e., predict for future 5, 15, and 20 days. All training sets start from
March 22, and all test sets start from May 17. We also split 𝐿> days from the training sets as
evaluation sets to determine model hyper-parameters. We set 𝐿0 to 5. All locations are used in
training and testing set by splitting along the time dimension, where early time windows are used
for training the model, and later time windows are used for testing the model. All the models use
the same training data and are also evaluated and tested using the same prediction time window.
We use the mean square error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE) to evaluate our model. We
also use the average concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) to evaluate the results. The CCC

measures the agreement between two variables, and it is computed as:
2𝜌𝜎C 𝜎D
𝐶𝐶𝐶 =
8
8
8
𝜎C + 𝜎D + \𝜇C − 𝜇D ]
where 𝜇C and 𝜇D are the means for the two variables, 𝜎C8 and 𝜎D8 are the corresponding variances.
𝜌 is the correlation coefficient between the two variables. Note that we chose not to use the
coefficient of determination (𝑅8 ) is because the range of 𝑅8 is (−∞, 1), so some extreme value
may significantly affect the average value. But the range of CCC is between -1 and 1, so we can
evaluate model results more reliably. To estimate a 95% confidence interval, according to previous
pandemic research[22], we resample the locations 1,000 times, calculate the score on the resampled
sets, and then use 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles of these scores as our confidence interval estimate.

RESULTS
Table 1 shows the average performance and a 95% confidence interval for state-level
predictions of our model and all baseline models. STAN achieves the best performance under
different lengths of the prediction window. When the length of the prediction window 𝐿> = 5,
STAN achieves 59% lower MSE, 33% lower MAE, and 23% higher CCC than the best baseline
ColaGNN. When the length of the prediction window 𝐿> = 15, STAN achieves 87% lower MSE,
56% lower MAE, and 47% higher CCC than ColaGNN. When the length of the prediction
window 𝐿> = 20, STAN achieves 48% lower MSE, 37% lower MAE, and 32% higher CCC than
ColaGNN.

The results show STAN can conduct more accurate long-term and short-term prediction than
SIR and SEIR models on both state-level and county-level. Since county-level graph data is more
granular, STAN can benefit more by utilizing such data than the traditional dynamics-based model.
It is also worth noting that both reduced model STAN-PC and STAN-Graph also outperform other
baselines. This indicates that both transmission dynamics constraints and real-world evidence
provide valuable information for pandemic progression prediction. We report the detailed
performance of each location in the Supplementary Material. We conduct a T-test between STAN
and each baseline model to check the performance difference statistically. The p-value is shown in
Table 3. The results show that for each baseline model, STAN can significantly outperform
statistically (p-value < 0.001). The detailed T-test results are shown in the Supplementary.

DISCUSSION AND LIMITATIONS
In this section, we will discuss the advantages and also the limitations of our model. We draw
the predicted curve of 20 days from May 16 to Jun 5 for two counties, El Paso, TX and Lake, IN,
and two states, CA and MA. As shown in Table 4, for the two counties, STAN shows up to 99%
relatively lower MSE compared to the SEIR and SIR model. For the two states, the performance
improvement is much greater, STAN can achieve at most 95% lower MSE compared to the best
SEIR models. And as shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4, the curve also fits the actual trend better for
both counties and states.

Figure 3. Predicted curve for two counties: El Paso, TX (left) and Lake, IN (right)

Figure 4. Predicted curve for two states: CA (left) and MA (right).
One obvious drawback of SIR and SEIR models is the overfitting issue. The SIR and SEIR
models tend to predict the peak will come right after current data, which is especially apparent in
the prediction curve of Lake, IN, and MA. This is because these traditional models do not
incorporate the influence and interdependency of transmission between geographic regions. The
characteristics of transmission of infectious diseases in one area are unlikely to be decoupled from
those of nearby areas unless there are barriers to interaction between the regions such as topography
(rivers with limited bridges or mountain ranges with limited road connections) or controlled borders.
Such decoupling is infrequently present between counties in the USA. The inability to account for
this geographic interdependency removes an important variable in the SIR and SEIR models and
impedes their ability to predict the future progression using limited data at the early pandemic stage.

Though deep learning-based methods can achieve better performance than traditional statistical
methods in various time series analysis and prediction tasks, there are still two major limitations in
our work. The first limitation is the prediction window setting in our method. The traditional SIR
and SEIR models use all historical training data to fit the model and generate the entire curve to be
less affected by the fluctuations in the data. However, our model divides historical data into
prediction windows in training time. This setting allows STAN to dynamically model the pandemic
progressions. Therefore, it can better simulate the situations such as changes in reporting policy or
dynamical changes in transmissibility or contagion. However, if the number of cases fluctuates
drastically due to inaccuracy in the data collection process, it is difficult for the STAN model to
learn valid and stable transmission and recovery rates. This issue can be further solved by applying
dynamic data smoothing to smooth such abnormal data points.
The second limitation is that the transmission dynamics constraints may be too simple to reflect
real-world situations such as home isolation and pandemic control policies. A lot of research focuses
on improving the traditional SIR model by adding more population groups and transmission
equations[3, 23]. These variants can be quickly adopted in our model by modifying the transmission
dynamic loss.
The third limitation is about data quality for constructing the attribute graph. For node features,
indeed, sometimes ICD codes may not reflect real pandemic status due to report delay or other
reasons. And the edge mobility calculation can also be improved by incorporating more data sources
such as traffic info or mobile geolocation tracking. Besides, the dynamic features and static features
are processed together without considering their different characteristics. Future work can
incorporate more data sources and extend the transmission dynamics constraints into STAN to
further enhance the prediction performance with richer data and process different data types more
reasonably. Our model can also be easily adopted for mortality or hospitalization prediction tasks
by adding related statistics such as COVID-19 related treatment codes and ICU codes to the data.

CONCLUSION
In this work, we propose a spatio-temporal attention network model (STAN) for the COVID19 pandemic prediction. We map locations (e.g., a county or a state) to nodes on a graph. We use a
set of static and dynamic features extracted from multiple real-world evidence, including real-world
medical claims data, to construct nodes and use geographical proximity and demographic similarity
between locations to construct edges. We use the graph attention network to incorporate the variant
influence of the different neighboring locations of a node and predict the number of infected patients
for a fixed period into the future. We also impose transmission dynamics constraints on predictions
according to transmission dynamics. STAN achieves better prediction performance than the
traditional SIR and SEIR model and other deep learning methods and shows less overfitting issues
at the early stage of the pandemic. We hope our model can help governments and researchers better

allocate medical resources and make policies to control the pandemic earlier. Our model can also
be easily extended to predict hospitalization of COVID-19 as future work.

DATA DETAILS
The data from JHU Coronavirus Resource Center was collected from March 22, 2020 to June
10, 2020. It has the number of active cases, confirmed cases, and deaths related to COVID-19 for
different US locations. We select states with more than 1,000 confirmed cases by May 17 to ensure
the data source accuracy, and finally we have 45 states and 193 counties in the dataset. For those
counties, we set the number of cases before their respective first record dates as zero.
The IQVIA’s claims data is from the IQVIA US9 Database. The claims data are directly
exported from the IQVIA's US claims database. This database contains adjudicated medical and
pharmacy claims, including patient enrollment data for national and sub-national health plans and
self-insured employer groups. We aggregated the hospitalization and ICU-related ICD codes to
calculate the number of hospitalizations and ICU stays. The frequency of diagnosis codes is summed
up for each location each day. The dataset has records for a total of 453,089 patients across the entire
timespan of the JHU dataset. There are a total of 48 unique ICD-10 codes related to COVID-19 that
were claimed from the set of codes considered, as shown in Table 5. Except the codes for defining
COVID-19, we also include the codes of influenza and pneumonias because they are important
symptoms of COVID-19. Even those features are not directly related to COVID-19, deep learning
models are good at processing high-dimensional features and determine the proper weights
assigning to those features. Hence, including those codes do not harm the model performance but
may help the model to capture useful patterns from potential misdiagnosis and co-infections.
Detailed county-level and state-level statistics are shown in Table 6 and Table 7.
Table 5. ICD-10 (The 10th revision of the International statistical Classification of Diseases) codes
used in our dataset. We choose codes that are relevant to the COVID-19 symptoms.

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
All methods are implemented in PyTorch 1.1 and trained on a server equipped with an Intel
Xeon E5-2620 Octa-Core CPU, 256GB Memory and a Titan V GPU. For the hyper-parameters of
baseline models, we follow the recommended setting if it is available in the original paper.
Otherwise, we determine its value by grid search on the validation set.
For the STAN model, the hidden dimension of the GRU is set to 200 and the hidden dimension
of the MLP is set to 100. The graph embedding dimension is set to 400 and the graph attention
dimension is set to 650. The input sliding window 𝐿0 is set to 5. The 𝑟 is set to 30, 𝛼 and 𝛽 is set
to 0.35 and 0.37.
For the GRU model, the hidden dimension is set to 100. For the ColaGNN, the hidden
dimension of GRU is set to 256, the dimension of graph node embedding is set to 500. For the
CovidGNN model, we use a two-layer GNN and the dimension of graph node embedding is set to
256.

PERFORMANCE DETAILS
We report the prediction MSE for each state and county in Table 8 and Table 9. Due to space
limits, we only take SIR and SEIR into comparison. For all 45 states, when 𝐿> = 5, STAN achieves
the best performance on 37 states; when 𝐿> = 15 and 20, STAN achieves the best performance on
35 states. For all 45 states, when 𝐿> = 5, STAN achieves the best performance on 37 states; when
𝐿> = 15 and 20, STAN achieves the best performance on 35 states.
For all 193 counties, when 𝐿> = 5, STAN achieves the best performance on 134 counties;
when 𝐿> = 15, STAN achieves the best performance on 148 states; when 𝐿> = 20, STAN achieves
the best performance on 143 states.
While conducting county-level prediction, STAN can achieve better long-term prediction
compared to SIR and SEIR on most locations. This is due to the location graph is more granular and
the model can extract detailed spatial interactions between nodes. And also for some locations, the
pandemic haven’t outbreak, so STAN can better predict future progression by considering
progressions from neighboring locations. While aggregating the data and conducting state-level
predictions, STAN’s performance is more consistent over all length of prediction window.
