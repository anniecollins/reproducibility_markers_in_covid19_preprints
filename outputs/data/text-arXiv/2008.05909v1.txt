Abstract
Objective: We study the influence of local reopening policies on the composition of the
infectious population and their impact on future hospitalization and mortality rates.
Materials and Methods: We collected datasets of daily reported hospitalization and cumulative
morality of COVID-19 in Houston, Texas, from May 1, 2020 until June 29, 2020. These datasets
are from multiple sources (USA FACTS, Southeast Texas Regional Advisory Council COVID-19
report, TMC daily news, and New York Times county-level mortality reporting). Our model, riskstratified SIR-HCD uses separate variables to model the dynamics of local-contact (e.g., work
from home) and high-contact (e.g., work on site) subpopulations while sharing parameters to
control their respective 𝑅0 (𝑡) over time.
Results: We evaluated our model’s forecasting performance in Harris County, TX (the most
populated county in the Greater Houston area) during the Phase-I and Phase-II reopening. Not
only did our model outperform other competing models, it also supports counterfactual analysis
to simulate the impact of future policies in a local setting, which is unique among existing
approaches.
Discussion: Local mortality and hospitalization are significantly impacted by quarantine and
reopening policies. No existing model has directly accounted for the effect of these policies on
local trends in infections, hospitalizations, and deaths in an explicit and explainable manner. Our
work is an attempt to close this important technical gap to support decision making.
Conclusion: Despite several limitations, we think it is a timely effort to rethink about how to
best model the dynamics of pandemics under the influence of reopening policies.

Introduction
COVID-19 has taken the international community by surprise[1]. At the time of writing this
paper, the COVID-19 pandemic has surpassed 10 million confirmed cases and 500,000 deaths
worldwide[2]. COVID-19 is having a dramatic impact on health care systems in even the most
developed countries[3]. Without effective vaccines and treatments in sight, the only effective
actions include policies of containment, mitigation, and suppression[4].
The infection, hospitalization, and mortality trends of COVID-19 across different countries vary
considerably and are affected mainly by policy-making and resource mobilization[5]. Predicting
the local trends of the epidemic is critical for the timely adjustment of medical resources and for
the evaluation of policy changes in an attempt to curtail the economic impact[6]. In the United
States, policies vary by state and city, and therefore, robust local models are essential for
learning fine-grained changes that meet the needs of local communities and policymakers.
Under appropriate intervention, early studies observe a trajectory of consumption recovery near
the end of the eight-week post-outbreak period (following the classical epidemiology models)[7].
However, traditional models do not account for the impact of local policies, such as a multiphase reopening. The recent rebounds in Texas indicate different trends in different counties,
which motivated the need to study the underlying impact of policy on local mortality and
hospitalization trends. In this paper, we present the design of our regional model and
demonstrate its use by applying them to the Houston, TX area marking their difference from the
global trend estimation models.
Due to the lack of consistent and accurate estimations of infection rates in asymptomatic
individuals (using, e.g., random serological testing[8]), we are focusing on mortality and
hospitalization. We present the development of a forecasting model using local fine-grained
hospital-level data to track the changes in hospitalization and mortality rates owing to reopening
orders in the greater Houston area encompassing nine counties in the state of Texas, USA. The
modeled area consists of 4,600 km2, incorporating a population of 3,012,050 adults and
1,080,409 children (by the 2010 census) and includes over 100 hospitals with a total bed
capacity of 23,940[9,10]. Our methodological contribution is directly modeling the impact of
phased reopening. We achieve it by splitting the targeted population into low-contact and highcontact groups (determined by the subpopulations that return to work at different phases of the
reopening). The mechanism adjusts the proportion of infectious subpopulations (depending on
their category of jobs) to quantitatively represent the policy impact on the epidemiological
dynamical system (please refer to Figure 1 for a high-level overview). It can built into most
existing epidemiological models without ease, offering additional explanation ability and better
prediction efficacy. We demonstrated our new approach using a policy-aware risk-Stratified
Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered Hospitalization-Critical-Dead (SSIR-HCD) model, which
compared favorably to existing methods (including our neural network latent space modeling, a
nonlinear extension of SIR-HCD).

Related work
There are many predictive models for COVID-19 trend prediction. The Center for Disease
Control (CDC) also hosts 23 different trend predictors[11,12] to forecast total death. There are
several big categories:
●

●

●
●

Purely data-driven models (with no modeling of disease dynamics), which includes
regression-based parametric and non-parametric models (Auto-Regressive Integrated
Moving Average or ARIMA, Support Vector Regression, Random Forest), neural
network (deep learning) based trend prediction (e.g., GT-DeepCOVID[13]), etc.
Epidemiology based dynamic models based on grouping populations into a discrete set
of compartments (i.e., states), and defining ordinary differential equations (ODE) rate
equations describing the movement of people between compartments: SEIR
(Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Recovered) models and their myriad variants are
examples in this category.
Individual-level network-based models: finest grain modeling of a population through
agent simulation, such as the ones built in NetLogo by Marathe et al. [14] and
NotreDame-FRED[15].
Various ensemble and hybrid models: including the Imperial College London short-term
ensemble forecaster[11] and IHME model [16] that combines a mechanistic disease
transmission model and a curve-fitting approach.

Among existing models, the ODE compartment-based models occupy a middle ground between
network models at the individual-level and purely count-driven statistical analyses that are
disease-dynamics-agnostic, which will be our main interest in this paper. Compartment models,
which originated in the early 20th century[17], still represent the mainstream in epidemiological
studies of infectious disease. They make a critical mathematical simplification by decomposing
the entire population into compartments (i.e., states), e.g., susceptible, infectious, recovered,
and use ODEs to model the transitions between the compartments (Table 1). These
compartment models make assumptions that the observation counts in the various
compartments naturally reflect the reproduction number R0 that changes over time. The recent
COVID-19 pandemic, however, has introduced the need to incorporate lockdown policy
interventions (i.e., how long the population will remain at home), which existing compartment
models have not considered. We observe different patterns of hospitalization and mortality even
within a single metropolitan area such as Houston, TX, which means traditional epidemiology
systems might not be sufficient to explain the dynamics. Many people speculated that local
policies (shutdown and reopening) could have introduced perturbations to the disease
dynamics. Still, it is not clear how to quantify their impacts and provide counterfactual reasoning
to support future policy decisions. Our SSIR-HCD is a unique effort to close the modeling gap
by using appropriate data to enrich the established compartment models. The only other
relevant model [18] focused on anti-contagion policies, which is significantly different from our
phased reopening policies model in that we considered the stratified risks in the population
(related to people who might have more chances of exposure, depending on the phases in the
reopening policy).

Data and Materials
We collected experimental datasets of the daily reported hospitalization and cumulative morality
of COVID-19 that occurred in Houston, Texas, from May 1, 2020 (the start date of Phase 1
reopening in Houston, TX) until June 29, 2020. Population data was collected by USA
FACTS[23], industry employment data was gathered from U.S. BUREAU OF LABOR
STATISTICS[24], and the hospitalization data sources originate from Southeast Texas Regional
Advisory Council (SETRAC) COVID-19 report[25]. We used TMC daily news[26] to set the initial
length of hospitalization for our model. We also used mortality data from The New York Times
county-level report[27]). Note that New York Times data combine confirmed and suspected
cases in their reporting of mortality. To be consistent, we used SETRAC hospitalization
reporting that contains both confirmed and suspected cases.
In this study, we focused on the data from Harris County, one of the nine counties in Houston,
TX with the largest population.

Method
We propose a forecast model based on SIR-HCD with a novel variant on compartments to
address the differences in local policy. In SIR-HCD, the entire population is divided into six subgroups: susceptible population 𝑆, exposed population 𝐸, infectious population 𝐼, recovered
population 𝑅, hospitalized population 𝐻, critical population 𝐶, and dead population 𝐷. The
transitions between sub-groups are governed by nonlinear ordinary differential equations.
Please refer to Table 2 for our nomenclature.

SIR-HCD overview
We use the SIR-HCD to model the state transitions. The model is a simplification of SEIR-HCD.
We decide to drop exposed state (E), which cannot be reliably modeled in COVID-19 because
the CDC guideline for exposure, determined as staying within less than six feet for more than
fifteen minutes from a person with known or suspected COVID-19[11], is too short a time period
to be modeled adequately. Thus, a simpler SIR-HCD model, which assumes the possibility of
direct transitions between the susceptible state and the infectious state, is more suitable in
COVID-19.
In the SIR-HCD model, some susceptible people may turn into an infectious status after the
incubation period. Infectious people may either get hospitalized or recover after a certain period
of time. A proportion of the hospitalized people might be admitted to the Intensive Care Unit
(ICU), while the rest of them will recover in the hospital. Similarly, among the critical cases (i.e.,
ICU patients), some people might die, and others will recover. Thus, the SIR-HCD model follows
a series of nonlinear ODEs to model the state transitions:

.

Note that 𝑅0 (𝑡), which is shorted as 𝑅0 and used interchangeably in our paper, denotes a
dynamically changing reproduction number (considering several changes of quarantine policies
published in Houston). The symbol 𝑇𝑖𝑛𝑐 denotes the average incubation period of COVID-19. In
the equations that models 𝐻, 𝐶, 𝑅, 𝐷, the term 𝑇ℎ𝑜𝑠𝑝 represents the average time that a patient
is in a hospital before either recovering or becoming critical, and 𝑇𝑐𝑟𝑖𝑡 denotes the average time
that a patient is in a critical state before either recovering or dying. In addition, 𝑟𝑎 refers to the
asymptomatic rate in infected populations 𝐼, 𝑟𝑐 refers to the critical rate in hospitalized population
H, and 𝑟𝑓 refers to the deceased rate in critical population 𝐶. This model is more robust than
SIR, as the introduction of more reliable observations of 𝐻, 𝐶, 𝐷 provides extra stabilization to
the dynamic system. Figure 2 illustrates the SIR-HCD model with its basic states and transitions
implied by the ODE function.
With reopening policies in place, there are more interactions between people and so the
likelihood of spread increases. Our expectation is either that 𝑅0 remains constant (because
people maintain safe distances and follow CDC protocols), or (more likely) that it increases with
spotty compliance with pandemic protocols. To make the computation tractable, we decide to
use the inverse operation of the exponential Hill decay equation to model 𝑅0 as following,
𝑅0 (𝑡) = (1 + (𝑡/𝐿)𝑘 ) ⋅ 𝑅0 (0)
where 𝐿 refers to the rate of decay, and 𝑘 controls the shape of the decay. When 𝑘 = 1, the
above exponential equation is just a monotonically increasing linear equation. We set the
starting point 𝑡 = 0 as the reopening date, May 1, 2020. The initial states 𝐻(𝑡 = 0) and 𝐷(𝑡 = 0)
are the numbers of reported hospitalized cases and cumulative mortality in Harris County on
that date.
We decided not to rely on confirmed cases, assuming that the actual number for the infected
population is larger than the reported number (such an effect has been reported in California[28]
and New York[29]). Since a fraction of the actual infected patients were hospitalized on the first
day, the initial infectious population 𝐼(𝑡 = 0) is therefore estimated to be 𝑚 times the initially
hospitalized number 𝐻(𝑡 = 0), where 𝑚 is a positive constant coefficient. Some studies
suggested that true positive infectious cases should be 50 - 90 times more than the reported
positives [30,31]. In the Harris County projection, we set 𝑚 to be 60, assuming that 𝐻(𝑡 = 0) is
approximately equal to “known positives” on the first day. To estimate the recovery rate, we

divided Harris' case mortality rate (the number of confirmed deaths on the current day) by the
number of confirmed cases 14 days before that, as reported by The New York Times[27]. The
average mortality rate starting from May 1, 2020, was 2%. Therefore, we have an estimated
recovery rate of 98%. In this case, the initially recovered individuals 𝑅(𝑡 = 0) = 0.98 ⋅ 𝐼(𝑡 =
−14) = 0.98𝑚 ⋅ 𝐻(𝑡 = −14), where 𝑡 = −14 refers to 14 days earlier than the starting date (i.e.,
April 17, 2020). The number of critical individuals 𝐶(𝑡 = 0) is set to be 50% of hospitalized
individuals 𝐻(𝑡 = 0) based on the average proportion of ICU usages among COVID-19
hospitalization in Texas[11,25]. The initial number of susceptible population 𝑆(𝑡 = 0) is
𝑆(𝑡 = 0) = 𝑁 − 𝐼(𝑡 = 0) − 𝑅(𝑡 = 0) − 𝐻(𝑡 = 0) − 𝐶(𝑡 = 0) − 𝐷(𝑡 = 0)
where 𝑁 is the total population in the county.
Following a previous SIR-HCD optimization method[22], we used the limited memory Broyden–
Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno algorithm (L-BFGS-B)[32] to optimize the ODE system. According to
previous COVID-19 studies[33], the constant parameter 𝑇𝑖𝑛𝑐 is set to 14 days. The optimal
values of parameters 𝑅0, 𝑇ℎ𝑜𝑠𝑝 , 𝑇𝑐𝑟𝑖𝑡 , 𝑟𝑎 , 𝑟𝑐 , 𝑟𝑓 , 𝐿, and 𝑘 in the model were obtained by minimizing
the weighted average mean squared log error (MSLE) loss function 𝐿(𝑀𝑆𝐿𝐸). To make the
prediction more focused on the recent trajectory, we used the squared log error at each time
point with a weight parameter satisfying the condition 𝑊𝑡 > 𝑊𝑡−1 . Finally, we used a time
inverse function 𝑊𝑡 = 1/(𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥 − 𝑡 + 1) in our model, where 𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥 is the maximum time.

SSIR-HCD model to explicitly account for local policy’s impact
In this section, we introduce the unique aspect of our model that differentiates it from existing
ones. Our intuition here is that people get infected either through family transmission or through
social (including job) activities. In the transition from a strict stay-at-home to reopening, the
population is subject to changes in their social activities, which impact their probability of
infection as well as their risk of transmission to their family members. Therefore, we can divide
the total population in Harris County into two groups; a low-contact group, which includes
people in industries that were still closed (e.g., working from home subpopulation and their
families, including those who are unemployed but not homeless), and a high-contact group
includes people in industries that were reopened due to economic restart (e.g., working on site
subpopulation and their families). Intuitively, the subpopulation of people who work from home is
those who continue to stay at home and have limited chances of contacting the working
subpopulation.
The two groups share the same fitted parameters 𝑅0 , 𝑇ℎ𝑜𝑠𝑝 , 𝑇𝑐𝑟𝑖𝑡 , 𝑟𝑚 , 𝑟𝑐 , 𝑟𝑓 , as well as the same
constant incubation period 𝑇𝑖𝑛𝑐 , but they are estimating different 𝑅0 . We set the initial 𝑅0 (𝑡 =

0)for the low-contact group is slightly lower than that of the high-contact group, and low contact
𝐿 is slightly higher than or equal to the high-contact group. This is to keep the low-contact 𝑅0
being differentiated from high-contact 𝑅0 overtime. The unique coupling strategy makes it
possible to directly reflect the impact of policy into SSIR-HCD (the superscript means squared
as we model two subpopulations in the joint SSIR-HCD model).
According to reopening announcements released on the Texas government website[34] and the
Houston employment rates by industry (reported by the Greater Houston Partnership
Research[34,35]), necessary industries such as transportation, utilities, government, and a
subset of the health services kept running before and during the reopening of the economy,
accounting for 32.3% of the population in Houston. After releasing Reopening Phase I policies
(May 1, 2020), 100% of the essential industries reopened, in addition to 15% health services,
25% professional and business service, and 25% leisure and hospitality, constituting a working
on site (high-contact) subpopulation proportion of 39.62% after subtracting the unemployment
rate of 0.4%[36]. The proportion of the high-contact population after Reopening Phase II (May
18, 2020) was a combination of 100% of the essential industries, 100% health services, 50% of
professional and business service, and 50% of leisure and hospitality industries. Hence, the
high-contact proportion among Reopening Phase II was 58.3% after subtracting the
unemployment rate. Our model accounts for the change of low-contact and high-contact
subpopulations between Reopening Phase I and Reopening Phase II, therefore directly
modeling the policy’s impact on epidemiological data over time.

Experimental setting
Our training process uses MSLE to minimize the errors in curve-fitting. Additionally, we
evaluated mean squared error (MSE), but it was not used for the curve-fitting process. As the
training period is very short, and the observation data is highly volatile, we do not directly use
the raw daily reported data for our training and forecasting. Similar to early work conducted by
the School of Public Health at UTHealth [37], we also observed some data bumps (i.e., a large
number of cases counted on one date instead of spread over time) in the reported
hospitalization and mortality. Following the same consideration to avoid the influence of
unreliable data on our modeling, we used a 7-day rolling average to smooth the raw inputs (and
generating the training hospitalization and mortality data in the experiments).
Figure 3 shows the 7-day rolling average hospitalization and cumulative mortality from March
25, 2020, to June 29, 2020. The Texas government started phased-in reopening of the state on
May 1, 2020 (the stay-at-home order was issued on March 31, 2020), then continued to expand
reopening industries on May 18, 2020. Following these reopening phases in Texas, the daily
hospitalization curve in Harris County was divided into three phases:
(1) Before Reopening Phase: March 25 - May 1, 2020
(2) Reopening Phase I: May 1 - May 17, 2020
(3) Reopening Phase II: May 18 - June 29, 2020

The hospitalization curve represents a delayed epidemic effect since the publication of the strict
stay-at-home order on March 30, 2020. After reopening policies were issued in Texas (May 1,
2020), their impacts start to impact the dynamics in Reopening Phase I and Reopening Phase
II.
Our local hospitalization and mortality modeling aims to fit the most recent phases (i.e.,
Reopening Phase I and Reopening Phase II) starting from May 1, 2020, to June 29, 2020. We
validated the accuracy with data between June 23 and June 29. For comparison, our baselines
were time-series regression models (exponential smoothing, autoregression, and ARIMA) and
vanilla SIR-HCD. We predicted hospitalization and mortality, respectively, in the time-series
regression models because they lack the capability to account for hospitalization and mortality
together in one model. We also included our own Neural Network SIR-HCD model, which is
equally flexible as SSIR-HCD. Interested readers can find the details in the Appendix.

Results
Trained with Harris County cumulative hospitalization and mortality data in Reopening Phase I
and Reopening Phase II, our SSIR-HCD model fits the trends in the training data well:
Reopening Phase I (MSE=27.67 for hospitalization, MSE=1.57 for mortality) and Reopening
Phase II (MSE= 5.20 for hospitalization, MSE=0.81 for mortality). As Figure 4 shows, the local
hospitalization and mortality training curves are very close to the reported data, and the test
curves also follow the data trends closely, which indicates our model is not overfitting to the
training period.
Table 3 shows the prediction accuracy of the baseline models and risk-stratified SIR-HCD
(SSIR-HCD) model. For the hospitalization prediction, the proposed SSIR-HCD model had a
significantly higher accuracy (MSE=8.04) compared to the baselines (MSE=649.63, 22.48,
20.98 for three time-series regressions, and MSE=54.04 for vanilla SIR-HCD). For mortality
prediction, we found that the time-series regression models generally predict well, and our
proposed model had comparable accuracy. This high accuracy in mortality prediction of the
general time-series models is mainly because the mortality rates were more stable than the
hospitalization curve over time.
Table 4 displays the fitted values of eight training parameters in SSIR-HCD equations for the
low-contact group and the high-contact group. These fitted parameter values correspond well to
the values obtained in previous studies of COVID-19 [11],[38],[39]. And the ratio of
hospitalizations turning into critical is close to the average ICU proportion among
hospitalizations in Harris County, which was 50% in our initial state settings [11,25]. The
constant parameter 𝑇𝑖𝑛𝑐 is set at 11.5 in both groups based on the values suggested by the
World Health Organization (WHO)[40] and the CDC[11]. As a sanity check, the 𝑅0 values in the
low-contact group are indeed lower than those values in the high-contact group, indicating a
lower expected number of cases directly infected by individuals in the low-contact group.

Counterfactual analysis
Figure 5 displays the SSIR-HCD model’s counterfactual analysis results (of our model) on what
would have happened in the absence of reopening policies after 160 days on May 1, 2020. In
the x-axis, day 0 refers to May 1, 2020, day 17 refers to May 18, 2020, and day 60 refers to
June 29, 2020. We restored the proportion of low-contact people and high-contact people to the
no-reopening status (corresponding to 31.90% high-contact proportion of the population) while
keeping all the trained parameters the same. Upon excluding all changes resulting from the
reopening policies, it is noted that both modeled hospitalization and mortality curves become
dramatically flat. The hospitalization curve with intervention reaches its peak on day 90,
reducing nearly 2,500 existing cases. This demonstrates that quarantine policies are effective in
controlling the spread of coronavirus as well as reducing the number of hospitalizations and
mortality rates. Similarly, Figure 6 displays the counterfactual estimations on what would have
happened if the Texas government did not continue to reduce limitations in Reopening Phase II.
In Figure 6, the presumed reopening policies in Reopening Phase I represent moderate control
to the hospitalization and mortality curves, reducing nearly 1,500 existing cases. Since a long
stay-at-home order is not economically practical, our counterfactual analysis demonstrates that
moderate reopening policies, keeping essential quarantine measures (such as mask order
adoption), and opening several industries to lower capacity, may offer a reasonable middle
ground between the strict quarantine and fully open economy. The chart of dynamic 𝑅0 values
show how dynamic 𝑅0 differentiates the low-contact group and high-contact group such that
modeled hospitalization and mortality curves would be flattened by increasing the proportion of
the low-contact population. The model does not use one single reproduction number value to
measure the integral transmission rate as the two subgroups have different levels of risks for
getting infected.

Limitation and Conclusion
Our SSIR-HCD model forecasts fine-grained COVID-19 hospitalization and mortality by
accounting for the impact of local policies. One challenge is that the SSIR-HCD model is very
sensitive to the initial values of 𝑆, 𝐼, 𝑅, 𝐻, 𝐶, and 𝐷 as the number of infectious agents is nonzero at the initial time point. We have managed to avoid overfitting the local time-series curve by
deploying values based on the accumulated knowledge of these initial variables and also using
a smoothed time series as a rolling 7-day average to alleviate the fluctuations. After variable
adjustment, the predictive results obtained a low error rate, while also obtaining parameters that
are close to real-world values, such as the asymptomatic rate 𝑟𝑎 that is close to 93.8% in the
COVID-19 Scenarios outcome summary[25].
In publicly reported data, the cumulative mortality data in Reopening Phase II do not perfectly
follow the hospitalization trends. Our expectation was that it would lag after the hospitalization
cases by approximately 14 days. The actual mortality rate fluctuated in the middle of Reopening
Phase II (despite we already smoothed the curve) when the number of hospitalization cases
started to increase rapidly. Nonetheless, our SSIR-HCD model still approximates the

hospitalization and mortality trends better than competing models. Thus, our model is
advantageous over baseline regressions. It can fit epidemiological data with complicated
shapes, such as Harris hospitalization data, based on the proportion of low-contact and highcontact groups and can consider several epidemiological states together into one model that
can make predictions for one or more sub-populations simultaneously. In addition to forecasting,
our model offers another unique functionality to support counterfactual analysis, which can be
useful in supporting critical decision-making.
However, our SSIR-HCD model inherited SIR-HCD in assuming a monotonically increasing 𝑅0 .
This assumption has limitations to the future when economic reopening might be paused due to
the overestimation of 𝑅0 (facing a big susceptible population). For example, if a local policy were
to clamp down on exposure (e.g., mandating masks and other means to influence infectivity), it
is not reflected in SSIR-HCD, which is an obvious weakness. One possible strategy is to
introduce an adjustable 𝑅0 control to the model, such as our extended model called Neural
Network SIR-HCD (See Appendix), which learns the quarantine strength over time to determine
𝑅0 change. Additionally, our model interprets the recovered population as those who can no
longer infect other individuals under the condition that the number of susceptible individuals
keeps decreasing over time. We did not consider the possibility that some COVID-19 survivors
may be reinfected after they were recovered, which could influence the modeling coronavirus
transmission rate. Several of these aspects involve controversial discussions in the scientific
community, but a powerful model should be able to accommodate different assumptions.
There are other reality constraints that our model is not taking into consideration. For example,
the number of daily hospitalizations and critical patients cannot increase without limit due to total
bed capacity in hospitals. In fact, Texas Medical Center reported they reached 100% of ICU
basis capacity on June 25, 2020 [41]. Our model did not consider hospitalization and ICU delays
when some hospitals are fully loaded, which needs more model parameters.
Yet another limitation of our model is the lack of full consideration for population density,
demographics composition, daily in-bound/out-bound traffic flows, and medical resource
disparities. For example, many patients in Harris County might come from other counties, but
they are treated in the Texas Medical Center (in Harris County), so the total hospitalization and
mortality might not completely match the local infection rates. Joint consideration of multiple
counties and decomposition of hospitalized patients in terms of their residency would produce
more accurate predictions.
We have presented a proof-of-concept of a policy-aware compartmental dynamical
epidemiological model by stratifying populations into low- and high- risk groups based on
people’s affiliated industries during the reopening phases at a county level using limited data.
We believe it is an important effort to better understand dynamic feedback of this stratification
through an ODE control system. There are many limitations and future directions that we have
exposed through this exploration. We will further explore these challenges with more data and
better assumptions to improve existing models.

Neural Network SIR-HCD model (with adjusted quarantine control)
Since the controlling parameter 𝑅0 within the SIR-HCD model does not account for specific
quarantine effects. In reality, it is reasonable to consider the quarantine factors for adjusting
free parameters in our existing SIR-HCD model. Therefore, we utilize a Multilayer Perceptron
(MLP) architecture [39], [42] to estimate the hidden variable 𝑄 and augment the epidemiological
estimation process. The augmented model introduces a quarantine strength term 𝑄 and
quarantined population 𝑇. We designed 𝑄(𝑡) as an n-layer MLP network with a weighted vector
𝑊, and the input vector 𝑥(𝑡) = (𝑆(𝑡), 𝐼(𝑡), 𝑅(𝑡), 𝐻(𝑡), 𝐶(𝑡), 𝐷(𝑡), 𝑇(𝑡)). Therefore, the hidden
variable 𝑄(𝑡) is estimated as
𝑄(𝑡) = 𝑁𝑁(𝑥(𝑡), 𝑊)
The original reproduction number 𝑅0 at each timestep 𝑡 is the constant value. We aim to adjust
the value of 𝑅0 by adding the variant quarantine strength term 𝑄(𝑡) so that the curve could be
more flexible to fluctuate policy changes.
𝑅0 ′ = 𝑅0 + 𝑄(𝑡) = 𝑅0 + 𝑁𝑁(𝑥(𝑡), 𝑊)
We utilized a Multilayer perceptron (MLP) network with two hidden layers in our implementation.
The first and second hidden layers each have 10 and 20 neurons with RELU activation function
(See Figure s1). The hidden variable 𝑄(𝑡) is estimated using the Neural Network. The new
ordinary differential equations for the augmented SIR-HCD model are

The starting point for the variables 𝑆(𝑡 = 0), 𝐼(𝑡 = 0), 𝑅(𝑡 = 0), 𝐻(𝑡 = 0), 𝐶(𝑡 = 0), 𝐷(𝑡 = 0) is
the same as ones in the idealized SIR-HCD model. The quarantined population is initialized to a

small value 𝑇(𝑡 = 0) = 10, and the neural network model learns how to estimate it based on
local data in each county.
The deep learning adjusted SIR-HCD model is trained by minimizing the weighted mean
squared log error loss function using the ADAM optimizer [43] for 1000 iterations. The loss
function calculates the weighted average squared error, in which the weight 𝑊𝑡 at a later time
has a higher value. The optimization continues until the loss value converges.

The Neural Network SIR-HCD model does not introduce mixture groups to control idealized
policy impact like the SSIR-HCD model. As a result, the Neural Network SIR-HCD model does
not perform so well as the SSIR-HCD model (See Figure s2), with higher MLSE in the steep
increase at the last time segment of hospitalization data. The quarantine strength term 𝑄(𝑡) is
adjustable on a rather small scale; therefore, it fits well on cumulative mortality data. The
limitation may originate from the simple design of its network architecture. Applying substantial
structure change may allow improvements.
