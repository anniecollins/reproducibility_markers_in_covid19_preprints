Abstract
Reliable analysis and forecasting of the spread of COVID-19 pandemic and its impacts on global finance
and World’s economies requires application of econometrically justified and robust methods. At the same
time, statistical and econometric analysis of financial and economic markets and of the spread of COVID-19
is complicated by the inherent potential non-stationarity, dependence, heterogeneity and heavy-tailedness
in the data. This paper focuses on econometrically justified robust analysis of the effects of the COVID-19
pandemic on the World’s financial markets in different countries across the World. Among other results,
the study focuses on robust inference in predictive regressions for different countries across the World. We
also present a detailed study of persistence, heavy-tailedness and tail risk properties of the time series of
the COVID-19 death rates that motivate the necessity in applications of robust inference methods in the
analysis. Econometrically justified analysis is based on application of heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation
consistent (HAC) inference methods, related approaches using consistent standard errors, recently developed
robust 𝑡-statistic inference procedures and robust tail index estimation approaches.

Introduction
Several recent papers have focused on econometric and statistical analysis and forecasting of key time

series and variables associated with the on-going COVID-19 pandemics, including infection and death
rates, and their effects on economic and financial markets (see Beare and Toda, 2020, Dimdore-Miles and
Miles, 2020, Harvey and Kattuman, 2020, ?, ?, Manski and Molinari, 2020, ?, ?, 2020a, Stock, 2020b,
and Toda, 2020, among others). This paper contributes to the above literature by focusing on robust
analysis of the effects of the pandemics on financial markets across the World. Among other results, it
provides the results of robust evaluation and estimation of predictive regressions for financial returns
and foreign exchange rates in different countries incorporating the time series of reported deaths from
COVID-19.1 We also present a detailed study of persistence, heavy-tailedness and tail risk properties of
COVID-19 deaths time series that emphasize the necessity in applications of robust inference methods
in the analysis and forecasting of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on economic and financial
markets and the society.
Econometrically justified and robust analysis in the paper is based on application of heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent (HAC) inference methods, related approaches using consistent
standard errors, recently developed robust 𝑡-statistic inference procedures and robust tail index estimation approaches.
The results of the analysis, in particular, indicate potential non-stationarity in the form of unit roots
in the time series of daily deaths from COVID-19 that are commonly used in research on modelling and
forecasting of the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects. The results emphasize the necessity in basing
the analysis of models incorporating the COVID-19-related time series such as daily death rates on
(stationary) differences of the latter. The analysis using a range of tail index inference methods further
indicates potential heavy-tailedness with possibly infinite variances and first moments in the time series
of daily deaths from COVID-19 and their differences in countries across the World.
In order to account for the problems of potential non-stationarity in the daily COVID-19 deaths time
series, the paper provides the analysis of predictive regressions for financial returns incorporating both
the lagged daily deaths from COVID-19 and their differences. Further, the properties of autocorrelation,
heavy-tailedness and heterogeneity in the time series are accounted for by the use in the predictive
regression analysis of both the widely applied standard HAC inference methods as well as the recently
proposed 𝑡−statistic approaches to robust inference under the above problems in the data.
The standard HAC inference methods indicate statistical significance of the (potentially non-stationary)
lagged daily deaths from COVID-19 in predictive regressions for returns on the main stock indices in
some countries, including the US, Japan, Russia, Brazil and India. However, according to econometri1

The focus on the time series of COVID-19 related deaths rather than infection rates is motivated by dependence of

the number of reported infections on a variety of different factors such as, importantly, country-specific policies on testing
for COVID-19, and its adoption and spread in different countries.

cally justified analysis with the use of robust 𝑡−statistic approaches in addition to HAC tests, the lagged
daily COVID-19 death rates and their (stationary) differences appear not to be statistically significant
in predictive regressions for stock index returns in essentially all countries considered in the analysis.
Overall, the main message of the results in the paper is that statistical and econometric analyses
and forecasts of the on-going COVID-19 pandemic and its impacts on economic and financial markets
and the society should be based on theoretically justified robust inference methods. The methods used
in the analysis and the forecasting of the pandemic and its effects should account, in particular, for the
problems of potential non-stationarity, autocorrelation, heavy-tailedness and heterogeneity in the key
time series and variables related to COVID-19, including the deaths and infection time series.

Ordinaries (Australia). The analysis uses central bank rates for the countries considered; European
interest rate is used for the members of European monetary union.
Throughout the paper, 𝐷𝑡 denotes the (cumulative) number of COVID-19 related deaths from the
beginning of the period on 22 January to day 𝑡 in the countries considered. Further, ∆𝐷𝑡 denote the
differences of the above time series, that is the number of reported deaths in day 𝑡. By ∆2 𝐷𝑡 we
denote the cumulative deaths time series’ second differences, that is, the daily changes in the number of
COVID-19 related deaths in the countries dealt with. The estimation and testing in the paper is based
on the periods with positive values of the number of COVID-19 related deaths 𝐷𝑡 in the countries
considered.4 The sample sizes of daily time series used in the analysis range from 63 (Finland) to 99
(China) observations (see Table B2).

Empirical results

4.1

Heavy-tailedness and tail risk analysis

As indicated in many empirical and theoretical works in the literature (see, among others, the
analysis and the reviews in Embrechts et al., 1997, Gabaix et al., 2003, Beirlant et al., 2004, ?, ?,
Gabaix et al., 2006, Gabaix, 2009, Ibragimov et al., 2011, and Ibragimov et al., 2015), distributions of
many variables related to or affected by crises and natural disasters and characterised by the presence
of extreme values and outliers, such as financial returns, catastrophe risks or economic losses from
natural catastrophes, exhibit deviations from Gaussianity in the form of heavy power law tails. For a
positive heavy-tailed variable (e.g., representing a risk, the absolute value of a financial return or foreign
exchange rate, or a loss from a natural disaster 𝑋) one has
𝑃 (𝑋 > 𝑥) ∼

𝐶
𝑥𝜁

(1)

for large 𝑥 > 0, with a constant 𝐶 > 0 and the parameter 𝜁 > 0 that is referred to as the tail index
(or the tail exponent) of 𝑋. The value of the tail index parameter 𝜁 is important as it characterises the
probability mass (heaviness and the rate of decay) in the tails of power law distribution (1). Heavytailedness (i.e., the tail index 𝜁) of the variable 𝑋 governs the likelihood of observing extremes and
outliers in the variables. The smaller values of the tail index 𝜁 correspond to a higher degree of heavytailedness in 𝑋 and, thus, to a higher likelihood of observing extremely large values in realisations of
the variable. In addition, importantly, the value of the tail index 𝜁 governs finiteness of moments of 𝑋,

The dates of the beginning of recorded (non-zero) number of COVID-19 related deaths for the countries considered

are as follows: 22 January for China, 13 February for Japan, 15 February - France, 20 February - Korea, 21 February
- Italy, 29 February - the US, 1 March - Australia, Finland and Lithuania, 3 March - Spain, 6 March 2020 for the UK
and the Netherlands, 8 March - Argentina, 9 March - Germany and Canada, 11 March - Sweden, India and Ireland and
Indonesia, 12 March - Austria, 17 March for Brazil and 19 March for Russia and Mexico.

with the moment 𝐸𝑋 𝑝 of order 𝑝 > 0 of the variable being finite: 𝐸𝑋 𝑝 < ∞ if and only if 𝜁 > 𝑝. In
particular, the variance of 𝑋 is defined and is finite if and only if 𝜁 > 2, and the first moment of the
variable is finite if and only if 𝜁 > 1.
The characteristics of heavy-tailedness such as tail indices in models (1) are of key interest for
policy makers, professionals in financial and insurance industries, risk managers, regulators and financial
stability analysts concerned with the likelihood of extreme values of risks, financial returns or foreign
exchange rates in consideration, their tail risk and the related risk measures.
Further, naturally, the degree of heavy-tailedness and finiteness of variances for variables dealt with,
such as economic and financial indicators like financial returns and exchange rates or risks and losses
from natural disasters, is crucial for applicability of standard statistical and econometric approaches,
including regression and least squares methods. Similarly, the problem of potentially infinite fourth
moments of (economic and financial) time series dealt with needs to be taken into account in applications
of autocorrelation-based methods and related inference procedures in their analysis (see the discussion
in Cont, 2001, Ch. 1 in Ibragimov et al., 2015, Ibragimov, Pedersen and Skrobotov, 2020, and references
therein).
Many recent studies argue that the tail indices 𝜁 in heavy-tailed models (1) typically lie in the
interval 𝜁 ∈ (2, 4) for financial returns and foreign exchange rates in developed economies (see, among
others, Loretan and Phillips, 1994, Gabaix et al., 2003, Gabaix et al., 2006, Gabaix, 2009, Ibragimov
et al., 2015, and references therein). These estimates imply that these variables have finite variances and
finite first moments; however, their fourth moments are infinite. At the same time, tail indices may be
smaller than two for financial returns and foreign exchange rates in emerging and developed economies,
thus implying possibly infinite variances (see Ibragimov et al., 2013, Gu and Ibragimov, 2018, Chen and
Ibragimov, 2019, and Section 3.2 in Ibragimov et al., 2015).
Heavy-tailed power law behavior is also exhibited by such important economic and financial variables
as income and wealth (with 𝜁 ∈ (1.5, 3) and 𝜁 ≈ 3, respectively; see, among others, Gabaix, 2009, and
the references therein); financial returns from technological innovations, losses from operational risks
and those from earthquakes and other natural disasters (with tail indices that can be considerably less
than one, see Ibragimov et al., 2011, and Ibragimov et al., 2015, and references therein).
The recent study by Cirillo and Taleb (2020) provides (Hill’s, see below) tail index estimates supporting extreme heavy-tailedness with 𝜁 smaller than 1 and infinite first moments in the number of
deaths from 72 major epidemic and pandemic diseases from 429 BC until the present. Beare and Toda
(2020) report (Hill’s) estimates of the tail index close to 1 implying infinite variances and first moments
in the distribution of COVID-19 infections across the US counties at the beginning of the pandemic.
Several approaches to the inference about the tail index 𝜁 of heavy-tailed distributions are available
in the literature (see, among others, the reviews in Embrechts et al., 1997, Beirlant et al., 2004, Gabaix
and Ibragimov, 2011, Ch. 3 in Ibragimov et al., 2015, and references therein). The two most commonly
used ones are Hill’s estimates and the OLS approach using the log-log rank-size regression.

5

It was reported in a number of studies that inference on the tail index using widely applied Hill’s
estimates suffers from several problems, including sensitivity to dependence and small sample sizes (see,
among others, Ch. 6 in Embrechts et al., 1997). Motivated by these problems, several studies have
focused on alternative approaches to the tail index estimation. For instance, Huisman et al. (2001)
propose a weighted analogue of Hill’s estimator that is reported to correct its small sample bias for
sample sizes less than 1,000. Using extreme value theory, Müller and Wang (2017) focus on inference
on the quantiles and tail probabilities of heavy-tailed variables with a fixed number 𝑘 of their extreme
observations (order statistics) employed in estimation as is typical in relatively small samples of fattailed data. Embrechts et al. (1997), among others, advocate sophisticated nonlinear procedures for tail
index estimation.
Gabaix and Ibragimov (2011) focus on econometrically justified inference on the tail index 𝜁 in
heavy-tailed power law models (1) using the popular and widely applied approach based on log-log
rank-size regressions log(𝑅𝑎𝑛𝑘) = 𝑎 − 𝑏 log(𝑆𝑖𝑧𝑒), with 𝑏 taken as an estimate of 𝜁. The reason for
popularity of the approach is its simplicity and robustness. Gabaix and Ibragimov (2011) provide a
simple remedy for the inherent small sample bias in log-log rank-size approaches to inference on tail
indices, and propose using the (optimal) shifts of 1/2 in ranks, with the tail index estimated by the
parameter 𝑏 in (small sample bias-corrected) regressions log(𝑅𝑎𝑛𝑘 − 1/2) = 𝑎 − 𝑏 log(𝑆𝑖𝑧𝑒). Gabaix
and Ibragimov (2011) further derive the correct standard errors on the tail exponent 𝜁 in the log-log
rank-size regression approaches. The standard error on 𝜁 in the above log-log rank-size regressions is
not the OLS standard error but is asymptotically (2/𝑘)1/2 𝜁, where 𝑘 is the number of extreme (the
largest) observations on the heavy-tailed variable 𝑋 used in tail index estimation (see also Ch. 3 in
Ibragimov et al., 2015). The numerical results in Ibragimov et al. (2015) point to advantages of the
proposed approaches to inference on tail indices, including their robustness to dependence in the data
and deviations from exact power laws in the form of slowly varying functions.
Figure A1 provides the plots of Hill’s estimates of the tail indices 𝜁 in power laws distributions for
the time series ∆𝐷𝑡 of daily COVID-19 related deaths in the countries considered with different number
𝑘 of extreme (largest) observations used in tail index estimation (the so-called Hill’s plots, see Ch. 6
in Embrechts et al., 1997, and also Cirillo and Taleb, 2020, for similar plots employed in the analysis
of the inverse 𝜃 = 1/𝜁 of the tail index 𝜁 in power law models 1 for the number of deaths from major
epidemic and pandemic diseases from ancient times until the present). Similarly, Figure A2 provides
the log-log rank-size regression estimates of the tail indices 𝜁 with optimal shifts 1/2 in ranks proposed
in Gabaix and Ibragimov (2011) for the time series ∆𝐷𝑡 dealt with that use different truncation levels
𝑘 for the largest values of daily deaths from COVID-19 used in inference (see Ibragimov et al., 2013,
for the analysis of such log-log rank-size plots for foreign exchange rates in emerging economies). The
plots provide the corresponding 95% confidence intervals for tail indices 𝜁 in power law models (1) for
the number of daily COVID-19 deaths in the countries considered.
The analysis of Figures A1 and A2 indicates that both Hill’s and log-log rank-size regression tail

6

index estimates tend to stabilize for most of the countries as a sufficient number 𝑘 of extreme (largest)
observations (order statistics) on the daily COVID-19 related deaths is used in inference. As expected,
log-log rank-size regression estimates tend to be less sensitive to the choice of 𝑘 compared to Hill’s
estimates.
Importantly, the left-end points of the confidence intervals for tail indices 𝜁 in power law models for
daily COVID-19 related deaths calculated using different tail truncation levels 𝑘 in most of the countries
tend to be less than two indicating possibly infinite second moments and variances. Further, from the
analysis of Figures A1 and A2 it follows that the tail indices may be even less than one for some of the
countries indicating extreme heavy-tailedness with possibly infinite first moments.
Extreme heavy-tailedness with possibly infinite variances and first moments for the time series on
COVID-19 related deaths is further confirmed by the results of tail index estimation for (stationary,
see the next section) time series ∆2 𝐷𝑡 of daily changes in the number of deaths from the disease (see
Figures A3 and A4 for the plots of Hill’s and log-log rank-size regression tail index estimates - Hill’s
and log-log rank-size regression plots - for the time series ∆2 𝐷𝑡 for the countries considered).5
The conclusions on heavy-tailedness in the COVID-19 related deaths time series are important as,
according to the above discussion, they point to high likelihood of observing extremely large values
of daily deaths from COVID-19. They further emphasise the necessity in the use of robust methods
in statistical analysis and forecasting of the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impacts,
including the approaches robust to the problems of heavy-tailedness and heterogeneity in the data.

4.2

(Non-)stationarity analysis

We begin the analysis by the study of the degree of integration in the time series 𝐷𝑡 , ∆𝐷𝑡 and
∆2 𝐷𝑡 on COVID-19 related deaths and their differences in the countries considered. Table B1 presents
the results of several unit root tests for the time series of daily deaths ∆𝐷𝑡 and the time series of
daily changes in the number of deaths ∆2 𝐷𝑡 . The results are provided for the (right tailed) likelihood
ratio unit root test proposed by Jansson and Nielsen (2012) (with the test statistic 𝐿𝑅 in Table B1;
see also Skrobotov, 2018), the GLS-based modified Phillips-Perron type tests (with the corresponding
test statistics 𝑀 𝑍𝛼 , 𝑀 𝑆𝐵, 𝑀 𝑍𝑡 ), the modified point optimal test (with the test statistic 𝑀 𝑃𝑡 ; see Ng
and Perron, 2001) and the GLS-based Augmented Dickey-Fuller test (with the test-statistic denoted
by 𝐴𝐷𝐹 in Table B1; see Elliott et al., 1996). To address the issue of possible heavy tails and infinite
variance of the series, for calculation of the 𝑝−value of the unit root tests, we use recently justified sieve
wild bootstrap algorithm with a Rademacher distribution employed in the wild bootstrap re-sampling
scheme (see Cavaliere et al., 2020).
An important tuning parameter in the above tests is related to the choice of lag length used in
5

Extreme heavy-tailedness with possibly infinite variances in the time series on COVID-19 related deaths is also

confirmed by weighted Hill’s tail index estimates proposed in Huisman et al. (2001) that are more robust to small sample
sizes as compared to Hill’s estimates.

7

the analysis. We use the modified Akaike information criterion (MAIC) lag choice approach based on
standard ADF regressions as suggested by Perron and Qu (2007). According to the results (the wild
bootstrap 𝑝−values are given in brackets), the unit root hypothesis in the time series ∆𝐷𝑡 of daily
deaths is not rejected at reasonable significance levels, e.g., 5% and 10%, by all the employed tests for
all the countries considered except Sweden, Finland and China. For the daily deaths time series ∆𝐷𝑡 in
China, the rejection of the unit root hypothesis is on every reasonable significance level (even at 1%).
The unit root hypothesis is rejected for the time series ∆𝐷𝑡 in Finland and Sweden at 10% by all tests
(the hypothesis is also rejected at 5% by the likelihood ratio test for Sweden, and by all the tests except
𝑀 𝑆𝐵 for Finland).
On the other hand, according to the results in Table B1, the unit root hypothesis is rejected at all
reasonable significance levels by all the tests for the time series ∆2 𝐷𝑡 of daily changes in the number of
COVID-19 related deaths in all the countries considered.
The above results of unit root tests have several important implications for statistical analysis of
models and key time series related to the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects. According to the results,
in most of the countries across the World, the time series of daily COVID-19 related deaths and thus the
time series of total (cumulative) deaths from the disease up to a certain date that are typically employed
in the analysis and forecasting of the pandemic and its impact appear to exhibit non-stationarity. The
daily COVID-19 related deaths’ time series ∆𝐷𝑡 appears to exhibit unit root process persistence for
most of the countries considered. This, in turn, implies very high persistence in the time series 𝐷𝑡 of
total deaths up to a certain date that appears to be integrated of order 2.6
One should also emphasize that, due to non-normality of the OLS and other standard estimates
of parameters in (e.g., regression) models incorporating nonstationary variables (e.g., regressors; see,
among others, the discussion in Sections 14.6 and 16.4 in Stock and Watson, 2006), the statistical
analysis and forecasting of key variables and time series related to the COVID-19 pandemic and its
effects such as the COVID-19 death rates should be based on stationary differences of time series with
potential unit root behavior as in the case of predictive regressions for financial returns in the next
chapter.

4.3

Predictive regressions

This section presents the main results of the paper on statistically justified and robust evaluation
of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on financial markets in different countries across the World.
6

The conclusions on persistence properties of the time series 𝐷𝑡 and Δ𝐷𝑡 are somewhat similar to those for the CPI

and the inflation rate (the change in the logarithm of the CPI) time series, where often unit root hypothesis is not rejected
for the inflation rate and thus the (logarithm) of the CPI levels appears to be integrated of order 2 (see the analysis of
non-stationarity in Section 14.6 in Stock and Watson, 2006, for the inflation rate and its changes in the US). These
conclusions imply the necessity of the use of differences of the inflation rate in time series modeling of inflation and its
relationship to other key economic variables such as the unemployment level in the Phillips curve (see Chs. 14 and 16 in
Stock and Watson, 2006).

8

We focus on the analysis of predictive regressions of returns on major stock indices in the countries (see
Section 3) on the time series characterizing the death rates from COVID-19 in the countries considered.
Importantly, due to the problems of nonstationarity and the unit root dynamics in the time series ∆𝐷𝑡
of daily COVID-19 related deaths in most of the countries discussed in the previous section, estimation
of the predictive regressions is provided for regression models for stock index returns 𝑅𝑡 with both
the lagged daily deaths ∆𝐷𝑡−1 and the (stationary) lagged changes in daily deaths ∆2 𝐷𝑡−1 used as
regressors.
More precisely, the estimation results are provided for predictive regressions in the form
𝑅𝑡 = 𝛼 + 𝛽𝑋𝑡−1 + 𝜀𝑡 ,

(2)

where 𝑅𝑡 are the excess returns on major stock indices in the countries considered at the end of the day
𝑡 given by the difference between the end of the day-𝑡 stock index returns and the countries’ interest
rates (see Section 3), and the regressors 𝑋𝑡−1 are either the number ∆𝐷𝑡−1 of COVID-19 related deaths
on day 𝑡 − 1 in the countries dealt with or the daily changes ∆2 𝐷𝑡−1 = ∆𝐷𝑡−1 − ∆𝐷𝑡−2 in the deaths’
time series.78
In order to account for autocorrelation and heteroskedasticity in the regressors and the error terms in
predictive regressions (2) we use the widely applied HAC based 𝑡-statistic (with the quadratic spectral
- QS - kernel and automatic choice of bandwidth as in Andrews, 1991) in the analysis of statistical
significance of the regression coefficients.
It is well known, however, that commonly used HAC inference methods and related approaches
based on consistent standard errors often have poor finite sample properties, especially in the case of
pronounced dependence, heterogeneity and heavy-tailedness in the data (see the discussion and the
analysis in Ibragimov and Müller, 2010, 2016, Section 3.3 in Ibragimov et al., 2015, and references
therein). To account for these problems, we also provide the analysis of statistical significance of predictive regression coefficients using the 𝑡−statistic approaches to robust inference recently developed
in Ibragimov and Müller (2010, 2016). Following the approaches, robust large sample inference on a
parameter of interest (e.g., a predictive regression coefficient 𝛽) is conducted as follows: the data is
partitioned into a fixed number 𝑞 ≥ 2 (e.g., 𝑞 = 2, 4, 8) of groups, the model is estimated for each group,
and inference is based on a standard 𝑡−test with the resulting 𝑞 parameter estimators.
7

The well-known stylized fact of absence of linear autocorrelations in daily financial returns implies exogeneity of the

errors in the predictive regressions considered.
8
We also conduct the analysis similar to that in the paper for the first and second differences of logarithms of daily
deaths. It points out to unit root non-stationarity in the first log differences and the implied stationarity in the second
log differences, similar to the differences of daily deaths in Section 4.2. We further obtain estimates in analogues of
predictive regressions (2) with the lagged first and the (stationary) second differences of logarithms of daily deaths used
as regressors. The conclusions from the estimates of such regressions are mostly similar to those for regressions with the
above differences Δ𝐷𝑡 and Δ2 𝐷𝑡 of daily deaths used as regressors (see footnote 16 below). The estimation results are
available on request.

In the context of inference on the coefficient 𝛽 in time series predictive regressions (2), the regression
is estimated for 𝑞 groups of time series observations with (𝑗 − 1)𝑇 /𝑞 < 𝑡 ≤ 𝑗𝑇 /𝑞, 𝑗 = 1, ..., 𝑞, resulting
in 𝑞 group estimates 𝛽ˆ𝑗 , 𝑗 = 1, ..., 𝑞. The robust test of a hypothesis on the parameter 𝛽 is based on
the 𝑡−statistic in the group OLS regression estimates 𝛽ˆ𝑗 , 𝑗 = 1, ..., 𝑞. E.g., the robust test of the null
√ ^
hypothesis 𝐻0 : 𝛽 = 0 against alternative 𝐻𝑎 : 𝛽 ̸= 0 is based on the 𝑡−statistic 𝑡𝛽 = 𝑞 𝑠𝛽^ , where

𝛽ˆ = 𝑞
𝑗=1 (𝛽𝑗 − 𝛽) . The above null hypothesis 𝐻0 is rejected in favor of

the alternative 𝐻𝑎 at level 𝛼 ≤ 8.3% (e.g., at the usual significance level 𝛼 = 5%) if the absolute value
|𝑡 ^| of the 𝑡−statistic in group estimates 𝛽ˆ𝑗 exceeds the (1 − 𝛼/2)−quantile of the standard Student-𝑡
𝛽

distribution with 𝑞 − 1 degrees of freedom.9
The 𝑡−statistic based approaches do not require at all estimation of limiting variances of estimators
of interest. As discussed in Ibragimov et al. (2015), Ibragimov and Müller (2010, 2016), they result in
asymptotically valid inference under the assumption that the group estimators of a parameter of interest
are asymptotically independent, unbiased and Gaussian of possibly different variances.10 The assumption
is satisfied in a wide range of econometric models and dependence, heterogeneity and heavy-tailedness
settings of a largely unknown type. The numerical analysis in Ibragimov et al. (2015), Ibragimov and
Müller (2010, 2016) indicates favorable finite sample performance of the 𝑡−statistic based robust inference approaches in inference on models with time series, panel, clustered and spatially correlated
data.111213 Importantly, the 𝑡−statistic based approaches to robust inference may also be used under
convergence of group estimators of a parameter interest to scale mixtures of normal distributions as in
the case of models under heavy-tailedness with infinite variances and in regressions with non-stationary
exogenous regressors.

One-sided tests are conducted in a similar way.
Justification of asymptotic validity of the robust 𝑡−statistic inference approaches in Ibragimov and Müller (2010,

2016) is based on a small sample result in Bakirov and Szekely (2006) that implies validity of the standard 𝑡−test under
independent heterogeneous observations and its analogues for two-sample 𝑡−tests obtained in Ibragimov and Müller
(2016).
11
See also Esarey and Menger (2019) for a detailed numerical analysis of finite sample performance of different inference
procedures, including 𝑡−statistic approaches, under small number of clusters of dependent data and their software (STATA
and R) implementation.
12
The t-statistic robust inference approach proposed in Ibragimov and Müller (2010) provides a formal justification for
the widespread Fama–MacBeth method for inference in panel regressions with heteroskedasticity (see Fama and MacBeth,
1973). Following the method, one estimates the regression separately for each year, and then tests hypotheses about the
coefficient of interest using the t-statistic of the resulting yearly coefficient estimates. The Fama–MacBeth approach is a
special case of the t-statistic based approach to inference, with observations of the same year collected in a group.

See Section 3.3.3 in Ibragimov et al. (2015) for applications of the robust 𝑡−statistic approaches in inference in

and Skrobotov (2020) provide further applications of the approaches in robust inference on general classes of GARCH and
AR-GARCH-type models exhibiting heavy-tailedness and volatility clustering properties typical for real-world financial

Table B2 provides the results of the assessment of statistical significance of the coefficients 𝛽 on the
lagged time series ∆𝐷𝑡−1 of daily COVID-19 related deaths and their differences - the daily changes
in the number of deaths from the disease - in predictive regressions (2) for the countries considered.
More precisely, the table provides the values of HAC 𝑡−statistic with the QS kernel and the automatic
choice of bandwidth discussed above as well as the values of the 𝑡−statistic in estimates of the slope
parameter 𝛽 obtained using 𝑞 = 4, 8, 12 and 16 groups of consecutive time series observations. The
asterisks in the table indicate statistical significance of the slope coefficient (*** for the significance
at 1% and * for significance at 10%) implied by formal comparisons of the HAC 𝑡−statistics with the
quantiles of a standard normal distribution. As described above, following the 𝑡−statistic approaches
to robust inference in Ibragimov and Müller (2010, 2016), (the absence of) statistical significance of the
slope coefficient 𝛽 is assessed in the table using the comparisons of the 𝑡−statistic in group estimates
of the coefficient with the quantiles of Student-𝑡 distributions with 𝑞 − 1 degrees of freedom.
The values of HAC 𝑡−statistics in Table B2 indicate an apparently spurious statistical significance
of the (potentially non-stationary) lagged daily deaths ∆𝐷𝑡−1 from COVID-19 in predictive regressions
for returns on the main stock indices in some countries, namely, for the US, Japan, Russia, Brazil, India,
Mexico, Canada and Lithuania, with unexpected positive signs of the estimates of the slope coefficient
𝛽 in the regressions.
However, the lagged daily COVID-19 death rates ∆𝐷𝑡−1 and their (stationary) differences ∆2 𝐷𝑡−1
appear not to be statistically significant in predictive regressions for stock index returns in all countries
considered according to the (econometrically justified) robust 𝑡−statistic approaches. The absence of
statistical significance of the coefficients on (stationary) daily changes ∆2 𝐷𝑡−1 in COVID-19 related
deaths is further indicated by HAC 𝑡−statistics for econometrically justified predictive regressions incorporating ∆2 𝐷𝑡−1 for major indices in essentially all countries considered.1516
and economic markets. The recent paper by Ibragimov, Kim and Skrobotov (2020) focuses on applications of the 𝑡−statistic
approaches in inference on predictive regressions with persistent and/or fat-tailed regressors and errors.
15
The formal comparison of the HAC 𝑡−statistic with quantiles of a standard normal distribution points to some
statistical significance of the slope coefficient in predictive regressions based on Δ2 𝐷𝑡−1 as a regressor for returns on
financial indices in Lithuania.
16
Similar conclusions are also obtained for predictive regressions for returns with the first and second differences of
the logarithms of daily deaths used as regressors. The analysis of predictive regressions for stock index returns based on
HAC standard errors indicates (an apparently spurious) statistical significance of the (potentially non-stationary) lagged
differences of logarithms of daily deaths from COVID-19 in some countries (Russia, India, Canada, Brazil, Japan, China,
South Korea, Indonesia and Australia). At the same time, both the lagged first and (stationary) second log differences of
daily deaths turn out to be not significant in the predictive regressions for all countries considered according to the robust
𝑡−statistic inference approaches. The absence of statistical significance of the lagged second log differences for most of
the countries is further confirmed by HAC standard errors.

Conclusion
This paper presented the results of theoretically justified and robust statistical analysis of the effects

of the COVID-19 pandemic on financial markets in different countries across the World. The analysis is
based on robust inference in predictive regressions for the returns on the countries’ major stock indices
incorporating the time series characterizing the dynamics in the COVID-19 related deaths rates.
The paper further presented the results of the statistical analysis of (non-)stationarity, heavytailedness and tail risk in the time series on death rates from COVID-19 in the countries considered.
The obtained results point to non-stationary unit root dynamics and pronounced heavy-tailedness with
possibly infinite variances and fist moments in the time series of daily COVID-19 related deaths in most
of the countries dealt with.
According to the results in the paper, the standard HAC inference methods indicate apparently
spurious statistical significance of the (potentially non-stationary) lagged daily deaths from COVID-19
in predictive regressions for returns on the major stock indices in some countries, including the US,
Japan, Russia, Brazil and India. On the other hand, according to statistically justified analysis with
the use of robust 𝑡−statistic approaches in addition to HAC tests, the lagged daily COVID-19 death
rates and their (stationary) differences appear to be statistically insignificant in predictive regressions
for stock index returns in essentially all countries considered in the analysis.
The analysis and conclusions in the paper emphasize the necessity in the use of robust inference
methods accounting for autocorrelation, heterogeneity and heavy-tailedness in statistical and econometric analysis and forecasting of key time series and variables related to the COVID-19 pandemic and its
effects on economic and financial markets and society. They further emphasize the importance of the use
of correctly specified models of the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects incorporating stationary time
series and variables such as the daily changes in COVID-19 related deaths used in predictive regressions
in this work.
Further research may focus on robust analysis of the dynamics of a range of key time series related
to the COVID-19 pandemic, including infection rates; robust tests of structural breaks in models of
the dynamics of the pandemic and its effects on financial and economic markets, and applications of
inference methods such as sign- and rank-based tests that are robust to relatively small sample sizes
of observations in statistical analysis of key models related to the spread of COVID-19. It would also
be of interest to apply further estimation approaches for heavy-tailed models for time series associated
with the pandemic that are robust to small samples, including the recently developed fixed-𝑘 inference
approaches for power-law models (1) in Müller and Wang (2017). The analysis in these directions is
currently under way by the authors and co-authors.
