Abstract: The COVID-19 disease spreads swiftly, and nearly three months after the first positive case was confirmed in China, Coronavirus started to spread all over the United States. Some states and counties reported high number of positive cases and deaths,
while some reported lower COVID-19 related cases and mortality. In this paper, the factors that could affect the risk of COVID-19
infection and mortality were analyzed in county level. An innovative method by using K-means clustering and several classification
models is utilized to determine the most critical factors. Results showed that mean temperature, percent of people below poverty,
percent of adults with obesity, air pressure, population density, wind speed, longitude, and percent of uninsured people were the
most significant attributes.

1. Introduction
COVID-19 disease is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with common
symptoms of fever, dry cough, shortness of breath, and other signs of respiratory-related infections. World Health Organization (WHO) reported that 80% of patients experienced these symptoms mildly. However, older people (>60 years
old) and persons with co-morbid diseases are at a higher risk for severe symptoms and death (Velavan & Meyer, 2020;
World Health Organization, 2020). Besides, younger patients with no underlying disease might also experience severe
symptoms or even death (Jahromi, Avazpour, et al., 2020; The Washington Post, 2020; Yousefzadegan & Rezaei, 2020).
The first positive case of COVID-19 in the United States was reported in the state of Washington on January 20, 2020.
By March 17, 2020, Covid-19 has spread across all US states (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020; Saad B.
Omer et al., 2020). Figure 1 shows the aggregated COVID-19 positive case and death count maps for all US states until
November 6, 2020. Reports showed that on November 6, 2020, the top states for positive COVID-19 cases are California,
Texas, Florida, New York, and Illinois, while the top 5 states for death cases are New York, Texas, California, New
Jersey, and Florida. (1point3acres, 2020; John Hupkins University & Medicine, 2020).
Epidemiological models have been used for outbreak estimation and predicting upcoming peak and mortality
rate. Accurate outbreak prediction can provide insight into problems caused by COVID-19 and be used to develop
new policies (Pinter et al., 2020). The COVID-19 pandemic has shown a complex nature unlike other recent outbreaks
(Ardabili et al., 2020). The COVID-19 can more rapidly spread through human contact comparing to other recent epidemics like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) (Mallapaty,
2020). Furthermore, many known and unknown variables affect in the spread of COVID-19. So, it has an uncertain
out-break prediction that cannot be estimated accurately by standard epidemiological models. The growing big data
of the number of infected subjects, death counts, and possible influential factors requires to be managed and analyzed
by innovative solutions (Sujath et al., 2020). Multiple sources of data provide information about the various region

across the country including the growth of infection, geographical, local services and policies, and demographical
data. In order to have more precise and long-term prediction, Ardabili et al. (Ardabili et al., 2020) showed that the application of various Machine learning algorithm is more effective in estimating covid-19 positive case rate and mortality rate. They also mentioned that estimating the factors that affect the mortality rate is important in estimating the
number of patients and planning new facilities.

Previous studies have been shown that several factors affect COVID-19 spread and mortality rate. They showed
that meteorological factors could have an essential role in the spread of a virus (Chien & Chen, 2020; Wang et al., 2010).
Temperature can affect the life cycle and proliferation of viruses; precipitation and rainfall can impact water-borne virus
diffusion, while humidity and the wind speed can affect the dissemination of air-borne viruses (Chen et al., 2010; Lowen
et al., 2007; Pica & Bouvier, 2012; Wang et al., 2010; Wu et al., 2016). Different studies showed contradictory effects
regarding the meteorological attributes on the transmission or lifespan of Coronavirus. Liu et al. (Liu et al., 2020) studied
the correlation between confirmed case counts and weather-related attributes. The results showed that diurnal temperature, ambient temperature, and humidity are significant attributes and have negative correlations with the transmission of COVID-19. Moges Menebo (Moges Menebo, 2020) found that the maximum temperature and the normal temperature (average of high and low temperatures) have positive, but precipitation has negative impact on COVID-19
case counts. Ma et al. (Ma et al., 2020) evaluated the effects of meteorological and air pollutant factors on COVID-19
death rates. They concluded that diurnal temperature range and absolute humidity are positively and negatively

associated with COVID-19 mortality rate, respectively. He et al. (He et al., 2021) studied the effects of temperature and
relative humidity on daily COVID-19 confirmed positive cases in different Asian cities. Their study revealed that in
different cities, the impact of temperature on COVID-19 confirmed cases could differ. In Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, the correlation between temperature and the number of positive cases was negative, while in Japan, it was positive. The study conducted by Pahuja et al. (Pahuja et al., 2021) demonstrated a positive correlation between the wind
speed and the COVID-19 case counts. In contrast, Coccia (Coccia, 2020) showed that the high wind speed could reduce
the number of COVID-19 cases.
In addition to the meteorological factors, there are other factors that impact the transmission and spread of
COVID-19 positive case and death case counts. They include air pollutant factors such as the concentration of air pollutants (e.g., PM10 and SO2) (Coccia, 2020; Ma et al., 2020), demographic factors (e.g., elderly people index, population
density, etc.) (Coccia, 2020), adults smoking history (Patanavanich & Glantz, 2020; Zheng et al., 2020), location-based
factors (e.g., latitude) (Coccia, 2020; Franch-Pardo et al., 2020; Jüni et al., 2020; Walrand, 2021), and disease-related factors (e.g., cardiovascular or respiratory disease experience) (Bansal, 2020; Coccia, 2020; Jordan et al., 2020; Zheng et al.,
2020). Besides, the COVID-19 outbreak challenges medical systems worldwide in many aspects like increasing the demands for hospital beds and medical equipment (Zoabi et al., 2021). The shortage of the healthcare resources creates
challenges for treating critically ill patients (Shoukat et al., 2020).
Reviewing the literature indicated that an analysis that took into account a comprehensive set of factors affecting
the rate of positive COVID-19 cases and its death rate was missing. The contradictory findings might be due to confounding factors and a comprehensive study based on a wide range of predictor variables will result in more accurate
characterization. Besides, as Figure 1 shows, states with a high number of COVID-19 cases (e.g., Florida, New York, and
California) are located in areas that are different in terms of geographical, health, demographical, and meteorological
characteristics. However, the majority of the previous studies analyzed the factors affecting COVID-19 transmission in
the areas with similar characteristics (e.g., geographical, demographical, etc.). Hence, a comprehensive model that considers more extensive areas (e.g., all US counties) with different geographical, health, demographical, and meteorological features will be able to characterize the differences in risk across these diverse regions.
In this study, a comprehensive set of factors that affect the risk level of COVID-19 in all US counties have been
analyzed. To perform this analysis, we combined unsupervised and supervised learning using clustering analysis and
classification models. The results of this study show why some areas have higher risk of COVID-19 than other areas.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the methodology is described. Section 3 introduces the datasets
used in this paper. Then, the process of data preparation and cleaning is explained. The analysis results are presented
in Section 4. Finally, the findings are discussed in Section 5.
2. Methodology
Methodology
Figure 2 indicates the flow used in this article to determine the significant factors affecting COVID-19 transmission
and the risk level of each county. First, we combined data from different sources and corrected the inaccurate records
from the dataset (data preparation). Next, for feature reduction, we calculated the Pearson correlation coefficients between different parameters, and chose a single variable from each set of highly correlated variables. We then performed
clustering analysis on COVID-19 data using Elbow method and K-means clustering. Based on clustering results, we
labeled the counties into different classes of risk level. In order to profile the clusters and understand the features affecting cluster membership, we applied different classification models on the cluster labels (to overcome the class imbalance, we applied Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) (Chawla et al., 2020)). Classification model
with the best performance accuracy was selected to determine the significant variables affecting COVID-19 risk levels.

3. Data Preparation
3.1. Data Collection
The data used in this study was taken from various online sources from March 2020 to November 2020, and includes COVID-19 positive cases and deaths, demographic, meteorological, health, and location-based data for each US
county (Table 1). To evaluate the risk level of each county, we used the COVID-19 positive cases and death rates (positive cases and death counts divided by the population of the county) instead of their actual numbers. For meteorological
data, we took the average of the data over all days of each month to have the average monthly data to match the temporal granularity of other data sets. The maximum and minimum temperatures for each county were derived from the
maximum and minimum temperature across all days from March to November. Population density along with the
population of elderly people (>65 years old) and young people (<65 years old) were also included in the dataset. The
parameters used in this study are shown in Table 1.

3.2. Data Cleaning
After combining the data from various sources, it was found that some values were missing in different variables
(Figure 3). Missing values for the demographic data were replaced with data from the United States Census Bureau
website (United States Census Bureau, 2020). If no data was available for a specific county, values were imputed using
the average of the non-missing values of that parameter across the state for income related data. For weather data, the
missing values are imputed with the data available from one neighboring county. For example, the missing precipitation, air pressure and dewpoint values for the “District of Columbia” county were replaced with the corresponding
data for “Arlington” county in Virginia state. The total number of counties analyzed in the current study was 3131.

3.3. Removing Collinearities by Correlation
After normalizing all independent parameters, Pearson Correlation was calculated for all variables (correlation
matrix shown in Figure 4), and among the ones with high linear correlation (greater than 0.8) only one was kept. The
final parameters for further analyses are shown in Table 2.

4. Results
4.1. Clustering Analysis
To determine the COVID-19 risk level for each county, K-means clustering was performed on COVID-19 positive
rates and death rates. Clustering was performed to group the counties based on similarities in their risk profile. To
determine the optimal number of clusters that can define the risk level of each county, the Elbow method is used (Figure
5). The Elbow method is a visual method that can determine the optimal number of clusters considering the total withincluster sum of squares of Euclidean distances (the cost). The optimized k value (k is the number of clusters) is such that
adding another cluster (k+1) does not significantly decrease the benefit. In the Elbow method plot, the optimal k value
is located at the elbow of the curve (Kodinariya & Makwana, 2013; Purnima & Arvind, 2014).
Figure 5 shows that k=3 could be the optimal number of clusters. Figure 6 shows the K-means clustering result
that clustered the counties into three groups of low positive-low death rate, medium positive-medium death rate, and
high positive-high death rate. The county located far apart from the other points (in the top right quadrant in Figure 6)
belongs to the New York County, which had a positive rate of 15.5% and a death rate of 1.5%.

Figure 7 and Table 3 show descriptive results of each cluster. Cluster 1 is the low-risk cluster. It contains the
highest number of counties with the lowest positive rate and death rate on average. On the other hand, cluster 3 has the
lowest number of counties but the highest positive rate and death rate on average, which refers to high-risk counties.
Cluster 2 is considered as the medium-risk cluster.
In the next section, classification analysis is applied on the results of clustering to find the significant parameters
that affect the risk level of each county. Three COVID-19 risk levels of Low, medium, and high were used as labels for
the classification analysis.

4.2. Model Selection
As can be seen in Table 3, there is size imbalance between different classes. We addressed the class imbalance
using SMOTE. Then, to determine the significant factors, different classification models were employed to characterize
COVID-19 risk clusters. Based on the accuracy values attained, the best model was used to select the factors with the
highest significance in the transmission and mortality rate of COVID-19.
For classification, the data was divided into train and test sets (80% and 20%, respectively). Table 4 shows the
classification models used in this study and their respective test accuracies. Among the classification models, Random
Forest obtained the best performance on the test data. The linear models including MLR, LDA, and SVM Linear performed similarly. Therefore, to perform feature selection, we select the Random Forest model.

4.3. Feature Selection
To identify the parameters which affect a county’s COVID-19 risk level, the Random Forest model was used.
Figure 8 shows the variable importance scores of Mean Decrease Accuracy (MDA, a measure of model accuracy loss by
excluding each variable) and Mean Decrease in Gini (MDG, a measure of each variable’s contribution to the homogeneity of the nodes and leaves in the resulting Random Forest) (Han et al., 2016).

Gini
Based on both MDA and MDG criteria, mean temperature, percent of people below poverty (people with income lower
than the threshold determined by the United States Census Bureau (United States Census Bureau, 2021)), air pressure,
longitude, percentage of uninsured people and population density are the highest contributing factors to the level of COVID19 transmission and mortality rate.
In order to verify the consistency of important factors and to better interpret the contribution of each parameter
to COVID-19 risk level, we used the Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR) model. For that purpose, a backward selection approach was used based on the p-values of the coefficients in the MLR model (considering 95% confidence
interval, a=0.05). The selected factors using this criterion were mean temperature, percent of people below poverty, air pressure, longitude, percentage of uninsured people, population density, percent of adults with obesity (BMI > 30 (Ogden et al., 2020))
and wind speed. These selected features by the MLR model are almost the same as the features selected by the Random
Forest model. It should be noted that other models with acceptable accuracy values (e.g., LDA, KNN, and SVM) suggested almost the same significant factors as MLR.
4.4. Significant Variables Analysis
In this step, the MLR model is applied only to the significant variables. Table 5 shows the coefficients and 95%
confidence intervals of significant variables driven from the MLR model. The column Cluster 2 shows the odds ratio of
variables of cluster 2 compared to cluster 1, and the column Cluster 3 shows the odds ratio of the third columns are for
cluster 3 compared to cluster 1.

Table 5 demonstrates that increasing the average temperature, percent of people below poverty, percent of adults
with obesity, longitude, wind speed, population density, air pressure, and percent of people uninsured would increase
a county's chance to be in a cluster with a higher level of COVID-19 risk. On the other hand, increasing the air pressure
would decrease that chance. Among them, mean temperature and population density are the two factors which have
the highest impact on the risk level.
Previous studies concluded that there is a positive relationship between temperature and COVID-19 cases (Islam
et al., 2021; Ma et al., 2020; Moges Menebo, 2020). The results of this study were in line with their conclusion. Higher
average temperature belonged to clusters 2 and 3, which had higher COVID-19 positive rate and mortality rate.
Results revealed that the percentage of people below poverty in a county was positively associated with belonging
to a cluster with a higher level of COVID-19 risk, as shown in Table 5. Low-income people might have limited access to
health products such as masks and sanitizers, which affects virus transmission and mortality (Jahromi, Mogharab, et
al., 2020; Ramesh et al., 2020). They are less likely to work from their homes due to unstable jobs and income or less
likely to have reliable and valid information about the COVID-19 (Little et al., 2021; Patel et al., 2020). Compared to
other factors, the percentage of people below poverty has the most significant effect on a county’s chance to belong to
the high-risk cluster.
Additionally, low-income people are less likely to have health insurance (the higher percentage of people uninsured). So, due to high medical expenses, they prefer not to go to clinics/hospitals or use medications, which might
increase the COVID-19 death rate and, as a result, increase the association of a county to a higher risk cluster.
As the center for disease control and prevention (CDC) (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2021b) stated,
obesity would increase the risk of COVID-19 death. Besides, obesity would affect the immune system adversely. These
are in line with the findings of this study. As the obesity percentage in a county increases, the chance of being in the
high-risk cluster would increase as well.
Results demonstrate that air pressure was a significant factor which lowers the chance of a county to belong to a
higher risk cluster. Air pressure determines the precipitation, wind, and weather condition. High air pressure is associated with mild wind and calm weather (ThoughtCo, 2021). So, as Coccia (Coccia, 2020) found, high pressure decreased
the transmission of COVID-19. Research conducted by Takagi et al. (Takagi et al., 2020) also demonstrated that high air
pressure would reduce the COVID-19 prevalence. Consistent with these studies, our study shows that the air pressure
lowers the probability of a county to belong to higher risk clusters.
Table 5 indicates that counties with dense population have a higher chance of being in higher risk clusters. In
dense areas, people cannot keep physical distance from others which is one of the most important factors to prevent the
transmission of COVID-19 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2021a; Moein Razavi et al., 2021).
Studies showed that COVID-19 transmission is dependent upon seasonal dynamics. Longitude is a factor that
correlates with seasonal dynamics and affects the COVID-19 transmission (Keshavarzi, 2020; Skórka et al., 2020). Findings of our study show that increasing the longitude would increase the probability of a county’s belonging to higher
risk clusters.
5. Summary and Discussion
In this paper, we analyzed demographic, meteorological, geographical, and health factors to determine the critical
parameters affecting the transmission and mortality level of COVID-19 in the US counties. Aggregated COVID-19 positive cases and death counts for each county were derived, and their rate with respect to population was calculated.
Pearson Correlation was used to remove the collinearities. Sixteen features were kept for further analyses. Next, Kmeans clustering was applied to group the counties based on COVID-19 positive rates and death rates. According to
the Elbow method, three clusters were chosen, representing low-, medium-, and high-risk clusters. The levels obtained
from clustering were then considered as the nominal dependent variable for classification.
Using cluster labels, several classification models were applied to the data. Random Forest and Multinomial logistic regression (MLR) models were finally chosen for a more accurate risk-level prediction and better interpretation
of the effect of factors, respectively.
Seven factors of mean temperature, percent of people below poverty, percent of adults with obesity, air pressure,
population density, wind speed and percent of people uninsured were found to influencing the risk level. Increasing
the mean temperature, percent of people below poverty, percent of adults with obesity, wind speed, population density
and percent of people uninsured would increase the probability that a county belongs to higher risk clusters. On the
other hand, increasing the air pressure would decrease this probability.
