Abstract
The novel coronavirus (2019‐nCoV) is a recently emerged human pathogen that has spread
widely since January 2020. Initially, the basic reproductive number, R0, was estimated to be 2.2
to 2.7. Here we provide a new estimate of this quantity. We collected extensive individual case
reports and estimated key epidemiology parameters, including the incubation period. Integrating
these estimates and high‐resolution real‐time human travel and infection data with
mathematical models, we estimated that the number of infected individuals during early
epidemic double every 2.4 days, and the R0 value is likely to be between 4.7 and 6.6. We further
show that quarantine and contact tracing of symptomatic individuals alone may not be effective
and early, strong control measures are needed to stop transmission of the virus.
One‐sentence summary
By collecting and analyzing spatiotemporal data, we estimated the transmission potential for
2019‐nCoV.
Main Text
2019‐nCoV is the etiological agent of the current rapidly growing outbreak originating from
Wuhan, Hubei province, China (1). At the end of December 2019, 41 cases of ‘pneumonia of
unknown etiology’ were reported by the Wuhan Municipal Health Committee (2). On January 1,
2020, the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, which was determined to be the
epicenter of the outbreak, was closed. Seven days later, the causative agent of new disease was
formally announced by China CDC as 2019‐nCoV. Human‐to‐human transmission was later
reported, i.e. infection of medical workers reported by the news and infection of individuals with
no recent history of Wuhan visit (3). In response, China CDC upgraded the emergency response
to Level 1 (the highest level) on January 15. By January 21, 2019‐nCoV infection had spread to
most of the other provinces. On January 23, the city of Wuhan was locked down/quarantined, all
transportations into and out of the city and all mass gatherings was canceled. However, the
number of confirmed cases has continued to increase exponentially since January 16 (Fig. 1A and
B). On January 30, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a public health
emergency of international concern (4) . As of February 5, 2020, the virus outbreak lead to more
than 24,000 total confirmed cases and 494 deaths, and the virus has spread to 25 countries. Initial
estimates of the growth rate of the outbreak based on early case count data in Wuhan and
international flight data up to mid‐January were 0.1 per day (a doubling time between 6‐7 days)
and a basic reproductive number, R0 (defined as the average number of secondary cases an index
case infects when it is introduced in a susceptible population), of 2.2 and 2.7 (1, 5); however, the
rates of growth in the number of confirmed cases during late January (Fig. 1A and B) suggest a
doubling time much shorter than 6‐7 days.
Here, with more up‐to‐date and high‐resolution datasets across China until the end of January,
we estimated that the exponential growth rate and R0 are much higher than these previous
estimates. We improved on previous estimates in three distinct ways. First, we used an expanded
dataset of individual case reports based on our collection and direct translations of documents
published daily from official health commissions across provinces and special municipalities in
China (see Data Collection in Supplementary Materials). Second, we integrated high‐resolution
2

real‐time domestic travel data in China. Third, to address the issue of potential data collection
and methodological bias or incomplete control of confounding variables, we implemented two
distinct modeling approaches using different sets of data. These analyses produced estimates of
the exponential growth rates that are consistent with one another and higher than previous
estimates.
A unique feature of our case report dataset (Table S1) is that it includes case reports of many of
the first or the first few individuals who were confirmed with the virus infection in each province,
where dates of departure from Wuhan were reported. All together, we collected 140 individual
case reports (Table S1). These reports include demographic information including age, sex and
location of hospitalization, as well as epidemiological information including potential time
periods of infection, dates of symptom onset, hospitalization and case confirmation.
Using this dataset, we estimated the basic parameter distributions of durations from initial
exposure to symptom onset to hospitalization to discharge or death. Our estimate of the time
from initial exposure to symptom onset is 4.2 days with a 95% confidence interval (CI for short
below) between 3.5 and 5.1 days (Fig. 1C). This estimated period is about 1 day shorter and has
lower variance than a previous estimate (1). The shorter time is likely caused by the expanded
temporal range of our data that includes cases occurring after broad public awareness of the
disease. Patients reported in the Li et al. study (1) are all from Wuhan and most had symptom
onset before mid‐January; in our dataset, many patients had symptom onset during or after mid‐
January and were reported in provinces other than Hubei province (where Wuhan is the capital).
The time from symptom onset to hospitalization showed evidence of time dependence (Fig. 1D
and S1). Before January 18, the time from symptom onset to hospitalization was 5.5 days (CI: 4.6
to 6.6 days); whereas after January 18, the duration shortened significantly to 1.5 days only (CI:
1.2 to 1.9 days) (p‐value <0.001 by Mann‐Whitney U test). The change in the distribution
coincides with the period when infected cases were first confirmed in Thailand, news reports of
potential human‐to‐human transmission and upgrading of emergency response level to Level 1
by China CDC. The emerging consensus about the risk of 2019‐nCoV likely led to significant
behavior change in symptomatic people seeking more timely medical care over this period. We
also found that the time from initial hospital admittance to discharge is 11.5 days (Fig. 1E; CI: 8.0
to 17.3 days) and the time from initial hospital admittance to death is 11.2 days (Fig. 1F; CI: 8.7
to 14.9 days).
Moving from empirical estimates of basic epidemiological parameters to an understanding of the
actual epidemiology of 2019‐nCoV requires model‐based inference. We thus used mathematical
models to integrate the empirical estimates with spatiotemporal domestic travel and infection
data outside of Hubei province to infer the outbreak dynamics in Wuhan. Inference based on
data outside of Hubei is more reliable because, as a result of the awareness of the risk of virus
transmission, other provinces implemented intensive surveillance system to detect individuals
with high temperatures and closely track travelers out of Wuhan using digital data to identify
infected individuals (6) as the outbreak in Wuhan unfolded.

We collected real‐time travel data during the epidemic using the Baidu® Migration server (Fig.
2A and Table S2). The server an online platform summarizing mobile phone travel data through
Baidu® Huiyan [https://huiyan.baidu.com/]. Baidu® Huiyan is a widely used positioning system in
China. It processes >120 billion positioning requests daily through GPS, WIFI and other means
[https://huiyan.baidu.com/]. Therefore, the data represents a reliable, real‐time and high‐
resolution source of travel patterns in China. We extracted daily travel data from Wuhan to each
of the provinces. We found that in general, between 40,000 to 140,000 people in Wuhan traveled
to destinations outside of Hubei province daily before the lock‐down of the city on January 23,
with travel peaks on January 9, 21 and 22 (Fig. 2B). Thus, it is likely that this massive flow of
people from Hubei province during January facilitated the rapid dissemination of virus.
We integrated the travel data into our inferential models using two approaches. The rationale of
the first model, the ‘first‐arrival’ approach, is that an increasing fraction of people infected in
Wuhan increases the likelihood that one such case is exported to the other provinces. Hence,
how soon new cases are observed in other provinces can inform disease progression in Wuhan
(Fig. 2C). This has similarities with earlier analyses to estimate the size of the 2019‐nCoV outbreak
in Wuhan based on international travel data (5, 7, 8), though inference based infected cases
outside of China may suffer large uncertainty due to the low volume of international travel. In
our model, we assumed exponential growth for the infected population I* in Wuhan, 𝐼 ∗ 𝑡
𝑒
, where 𝑟 is the exponential growth rate and 𝑡 is the time of the exponential growth
1. Note that 𝑡 is likely to be later than the date of the first infection event,
initiation, i.e. 𝐼∗ 𝑡
because multiple infections may be needed before the onset of exponential growth (9). We used
travel data to each of the provinces (Table S3) and the earliest times that an infected individual
arrived at a province across a total of 26 provinces (Fig. 2D) to infer 𝑟 and 𝑡 (see Supplementary
Materials for details). Model predictions of arrival times in the 26 provinces fitted the actual data
well (Fig. S2). We estimated that the date of the beginning of an exponential growth is December
20, 2019 (CI: December 11 to 26). This suggests that human infections in early December may be
due to spillovers from the animal reservoir or limited chains of transmission (10, 11). The growth
rate of the outbreak is estimated to be 0.29 per day (CI: 0.21 to 0.37 per day), a much higher rate
than two recent estimates (1, 5). This growth rate corresponds to a doubling time of 2.4 days.
We further estimated that the total infected population size in Wuhan was approximately 4,100
(CI: 2,423 to 6,178) on January 18, which is remarkably consistent with a recently posted estimate
(7). The estimated number of infected individuals is 18,700 (CI: 7,147, 38,663) on January 23, i.e.
the date when Wuhan started lock down. We projected that without any control measure, the
infected population would be approximately 233,400 (CI: 38,757 to 778,278) by the end of
January (Fig. S3).
An alternative model, the ‘case count’ approach, used daily case count data between January 19
and 26 from provinces outside of Hubei to infer the initiation and the growth rate of the outbreak.
We restricted the data to this period because during this time infected persons found outside of
Hubei province generally reported visiting Wuhan within 14 days of becoming symptomatic, i.e.
cases during that time period were indicative of the dynamics in Wuhan. We developed a meta‐
population model based on the classical SEIR model (12). We assumed a deterministic
exponential growth for the infected populations in Wuhan, whereas in other provinces, we
4

represented the trajectory of infected individuals who travelled from Wuhan using a stochastic
agent‐based model. The transitions of the infected individuals from symptom onset to
hospitalization and then to case confirmation were assumed to follow the distributions inferred
from the case report data (see Supplementary Materials for detail). Simulation of the model using
best fit parameters showed that the model described the observed case counts over time well
(Fig. 2E). The estimated date of exponential growth initiation is December 16, 2019 (CI: December
12 to Dec 21) and the exponential growth rate is 0.30 per day (CI: 0.26 to 0.34 per day). These
estimates are consistent with estimates in the ‘first arrival’ approach (Fig. 2F and G, and Fig. S4).
We note that in both approaches, we assumed perfect detection of infected cases outside of
Hubei province, i.e. the dates of first arrival and the number of case counts are accurate. This
could be a reasonable assumption to make for symptomatic individuals because of the intensive
surveillance implemented in China, for example, tracking individuals’ movement from digital
transportation data (6). However, it is possible that a fraction of infected individuals, for example,
individuals with mild or no symptoms (13), were not hospitalized, in which case we will
underestimate the true size of the infected population in Wuhan. We undertook sensitivity
analyses to investigate how our current estimates are affected by this issue using both
approaches (see Supplementary Materials for detail). We found that if a proportion of cases
remained undetected, the time of exponential initiation would be earlier than December 20,
translating into a larger population of infected individuals in January, but the estimation of the
growth rate remained the same. Overall, the convergence of the estimates of the exponential
growth rate from the two approaches emphasizes the robustness of our estimates to model‐
dependent assumptions.
Our estimated outbreak growth rate is significantly higher than two recent reports where the
growth rate was estimated to be 0.1 per day (1, 5). This estimate were based on early case counts
from Wuhan (1) or international air travel data (5). However, these data suffer from important
limitations. The reported case counts in Wuhan during early outbreak are likely to be
underreported because of many factors, and because of the low numbers of individuals traveling
abroad compared to the total population size in Wuhan, inference of the infected population size
and outbreak growth rate from infected cases outside of China suffers from large uncertainty (7,
8). Our estimated exponential growth rate, 0.29/day (a doubling time of 2.4 days) is consistent
the rapidly growing outbreak during late January (Fig. 1A).
Using the exponential growth rate, we next estimated the range of the basic reproductive
number, R0. It has been shown that this estimation depends on the distributions of the latent
period (defined as the period between the times when an individual infected and become
infectious) and the infectious period (14). For both periods, we assumed a gamma distribution
and varied the mean and the shape parameter of the gamma distributions in a large range to
reflect the uncertainties in these distributions (see Supplementary Materials). It is not clear when
an individual becomes infectious; thus, we considered two scenarios: 1) the latent period is the
same as the incubation period, and 2) the latent period is 2 days shorter than the incubation
period, i.e. individuals start to transmit 2 days before symptom onset. Integrating uncertainties
in the exponential growth rate estimated from the ‘first arrival’ approach and the uncertainties
5

in the duration of latent and infectious periods, we estimated the values of R0 to be 6.3 (CI: 3.3
to 11.3) and 4.7 (CI: 2.8 to 7.6), for the first and second scenarios, respectively (Fig. 3A). When
using the estimates from the ‘case count’ approach, we estimated slightly higher R0 values of 6.6
(CI: 4.0 to 10.5) and 4.9 (CI: 3.3 to 7.2), for the first and second scenarios, respectively (Fig. S5).
Overall, we report R0 values are likely be between 4.7 and 6.6 with a CI between 2.8 to 11.3. We
argue that the high R0 and a relatively short incubation period lead to the extremely rapid growth
of the of 2019‐nCoV outbreak as compared to the 2003 SARS epidemic where R0 was estimated
to be between 2.2 to 3.6 (15, 16).
The high R0 values we estimated have important implications for disease control. For example,
basic theory predicts that the force of infection has to be reduced by 1
to guarantee
2.2 this fraction is only 55%, but at 𝑅
6.7 this fraction rises
extinction of the disease. At 𝑅
to 85%. To translate this into meaningful predictions, we use the framework proposed by Lipsitch
et al (16) with the parameters we estimated for 2019‐nCoV. Importantly, given the recent report
of transmission of the virus from asymptomatic individuals (13), we considered the existence of
a fraction of infected individuals who is asymptomatic and can transmit the virus (see
Supplementary Materials). Results show that if as low as 20% of infected persons are
asymptomatic and can transmit the virus, then even 95% quarantine efficacy will not be able to
contain the virus (Fig. 3B). Given the rapid rate of spread, the sensitivity of control effort
effectiveness to asymptomatic infections and the potential of transmission before symptom
onset, we need to be aware of the difficulty of controlling 2019‐nCoV once it establishes in a new
population (17). Future field, laboratory and modeling studies aimed to address the unknowns,
such as the fraction of asymptomatic individuals, the time when individuals become infectious
and the existence of superspreaders are needed to accurately predict the impact of various
control strategies (9, 17).
Fortunately, we see evidence that control efforts have a measurable effect on the rate of spread.
Since January 23, Wuhan and other cities in Hubei province implemented vigorous control
measures, such as closing down transportation and mass gatherings in the city; whereas, other
provinces also escalated the public health alert level and implemented strong control measures.
We noted that the growth rate of the daily number of new cases in provinces outside of Hubei
slowed down gradually since late January (Fig. 3B). Due to the closure of Wuhan (and other cities
in Hubei), the number of cases reported in other provinces during this period shall start to track
local infection dynamics rather than imports from Wuhan. We estimated that the exponential
growth rate is decreased to 0.14 per day (CI: 0.12 to 0.15 per day) since January 30. Based on this
growth rate and an R0 between 4.7 to 6.6 before the control measures, a calculation following
the formula in Ref. (14) suggested that a growth rate decreasing from 0.29 per day to 0.14 per
day translates to a 50%‐59% decrease in R0 to between 2.3 to 3.0. This is in agreement with
previous estimates of the impact of effective social distancing during 1918 influenza pandemic
(18). Thus, the reduction in growth rate may reflect the impact of vigorous control measures
implemented and individual behavior changes in China during the course of the outbreak.

The 2019‐nCoV epidemic is still rapidly growing and spread to more than 20 countries as of
February 5, 2020. Here, we estimated the growth rate of the early outbreak in Wuhan to be 0.29
per day (a doubling time of 2.4 days), and the reproductive number, R0, to be between 4.7 to 6.6
(CI: 2.8 to 11.3). Among many factors, the Lunar New Year Travel rush in early and mid‐January
2020 may or may not play a role in the high outbreak growth rate, although SARS epidemic also
overlapped with the Lunar New Year Travel rush. How contiguous the 2019‐nCoV is in other
countries remains to be seen. If the value of R0 is as high in other countries, our results suggest
that active and strong population‐wide social distancing efforts, such as closing down
transportation system, schools, discouraging travel, etc., might be needed to reduce the overall
contacts to contain the spread of the virus.

Data Collection
Case count and individual case reports
We collected and translated reports from documents published daily from the China CDC
website and official websites of health commissions across provinces and special municipalities
in China (website URLs are available upon request). We collected daily counts of confirmed cases
in each province as well as 140 individual case reports (Table S1). Many of the individual reports
were
also
published
on
the
China
CDC
official
website
(http://www.chinacdc.cn/jkzt/crb/zl/szkb_11803/) and the China CDC weekly bulletin (in English)
(http://weekly.chinacdc.cn/news/TrackingtheEpidemic.htm). Our dataset includes demographic
information including age, sex as well as epidemiological information including dates of symptom
onset, hospitalization, case confirmation, discharge or death. Most of the health commissions in
provinces and special municipalities documented and published detailed information of the first
or the first few cases confirmed with 2019-nCoV infection. As a result, this dataset includes case
reports of many of the first or the first few individuals who were confirmed with the virus
infection in each province, where dates of departure from Wuhan were available.
Travel data
We used the Baidu® Migration server (https://qianxi.baidu.com/) to estimate the number of
daily travelers in and out Wuhan (Table S2). Specifically, we extracted from the server the
Immigration Index and Emigration Index for Wuhan, which are linearly related to the number of
travelers going in and out of Wuhan, respectively, based on cell phone positioning data. We also
extracted the fraction of individuals who went to or came from a particular province. It has been
reported that there were 5 million people going out of Wuhan between the start of the Chinese
New
Year
travel
rush
and
January
23

2020). This allowed us to calibrating the Emigration Index and estimated the number of daily
travelers to or from a particular province, and thus the fraction of people traveling to or from a
particular province (Table S3). These data were used in mathematical models to estimate the s

Estimating distributions of epidemiological parameters from individual reports
We used the first confirmed cases in provinces other than Hubei to inform the time between
patient infection and the onset of symptoms (𝑛 = 24). These individuals had all traveled to
Wuhan a short time preceding symptoms onset. Since these individuals were the first cases
detected in the province, it is likely that the infection occurred during their recent stay in Wuhan.
We approximated the time of infection as the middle time point of their stay. Because the delays

2

between infection and symptoms onset vary between patients, we modeled the delay using a
gamma distribution, as its support is nonnegative and it permits relatively large delays as
compared to the median. Figure 1 in the main text presents results from fitting the distribution
to the data.
The fitting procedure was performed by maximizing the likelihood of observed delays
between infection and symptoms onset. For a single observation, the individual likelihood is the
gamma density function evaluated at the infection-to-onset delay. Some of the delays were
censored, i.e. bounded by a certain value. For example, in some cases, only the times of infection
and hospitalization were reported, and the time of symptom onset was missing in the case report.
In such cases, we assumed that the missing onset time is bounded between times of infection
and hospitalization. Then, the likelihood for this observation is equal to the cumulative gamma
distribution evaluated at this censored value, i.e., the time when the patient was hospitalized.
The maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs) are the shape and scale parameters that maximize the
sum over all observations of the individual log-likelihoods. We used differential_evolution in
scipy.optimize library (Python) to perform maximization. A stochastic algorithm was implemented
in the optimization procedure to avoid being trapped in local minima.(1) The likelihood-based
confidence intervals was computed by methods reported in Raue et al.(2)
A similar approach was adopted to fit distributions to the time between symptom onset and
hospitalization ( 𝑛 = 96 ), between hospitalization and discharge ( 𝑛 = 6 ), and between
hospitalization and death (𝑛 = 23). The reported dates for these events was obtained directly
from official sources. Data from cases originating from all over China and neighboring countries
were used for distribution fitting. Detailed patient-level data is provided in Table S1.

The ‘first-arrival’ model: Inferring disease dynamics in Wuhan using the first-arrival times at
other provinces
In this model, we used the first-arrival time of a patient who traveled from Wuhan to a specific
other province and was later confirmed to have been infected by the 2019-nCoV. The rationale
behind our approach is that an increasing fraction of people infected in Wuhan increases the
likelihood that one such case is exported to the other provinces. Hence, how soon new cases are
observed in other provinces can inform the disease progression in Wuhan. We hypothesize that
this information is more reliable because the infected population in Wuhan needs to sufficiently
large to allow probable export of one infected individual. The flow of expected cases depends on
the flow of travelers to each province and on the proportion of the Wuhan population that is
infected by the virus.
We first estimated the daily number of travelers from Wuhan to each of the China provinces.
For this purpose, we used Wuhan’s daily migration index to other provinces and the daily
distribution of traveler destinations from Wuhan (see Data Collection). When assuming linearity
between the migration index and the total number of exported individuals, it can be estimated
that a migration index of 1 is approximately equal to 5 million individuals over the sum of
migration indexes from January 10 to January 25, 2020 (it was reported that 5 million individuals
left Wuhan during that period; see Data Collection section). The total number of daily Wuhan
travelers to a province at a certain date was then set equal to the number of travelers estimated
3

from the migration index times the fraction of the population having traveled to this province.
Results from estimation are reported in Table S2.
An infected traveler may be pre-symptomatic, i.e. this individual may have been exposed to
the virus (𝐸) and not have developed symptoms or be already symptomatic (𝐼). In fact, for many
individuals, infection onset was recorded days after the time of their departure from Wuhan (see
Table S1). Assuming travelers represent a random sample of the whole population, it follows that
the probability that a traveler is infected is equal to the number of exposed or infected individuals
in Wuhan (𝐼 ∗ = 𝐸 + 𝐼) over the total Wuhan population (𝑁(𝑡)). The total population size varied
during the infection period. We estimated the population size by using the daily inflow and
outflow of individuals from Wuhan (see Table S2). In order to represent the beginning of an
outbreak, we modeled an exponential increase in the size of exposed and infected population
over time 𝑡:
(1)
𝐼∗ (𝑡) = 𝑒 𝑟(𝑡−𝑡0 )
where 𝑟 is the infection growth rate and 𝑡0 is the time of onset of exponential outbreak.
Equation (1) allows a simple analytic expression of the likelihood of arrival times for the first
cases in each of the provinces other than Hubei. For a specific province, indexed by 𝑖, we modeled
the arrival of new cases in each province during short time intervals as a Poisson random process
(𝑖)
𝑋𝑡 . Note that the rate parameter of this Poisson process, 𝜆(𝑡) = 𝐼 ∗ (𝑡) 𝜅𝑖 (𝑡)/𝑁(𝑡) depends on
the time-varying sum of exposed and symptomatic populations 𝐼 ∗ (𝑡), the time varying flow of
population 𝜅𝑖 (𝑡) transported from Wuhan to the province 𝑖 and the time varying population size.
It can be shown mathematically (3) that the probability that no exposed or symptomatic traveler
arrived to province 𝑖 during a short time interval (𝑡, 𝑡 + Δ𝑡) , Δ𝑡 ≪ 1 is:
𝐼∗ (𝑡)𝜅𝑖 (𝑡)
(𝑖)
(𝑖)
(2)
ℙ{𝑋𝑡+Δ𝑡 − 𝑋𝑡 = 0} ≈ exp (−
Δ𝑡 ) .
𝑁(𝑡)
We assume no delay was incurred due transportation in our model. Equation (222) is valid for
any 𝑡 > 0, and because the overall process is Markovian, we can formulate the probability that
the time of arrival of the first case in province 𝑖, 𝑇 (𝑖), is later than 𝑡 by:
𝑀

ℙ{𝑇

(𝑖)

(𝑖)

(𝑖)

> 𝑡} = lim ∏ ℙ{𝑋𝑗Δ𝑡 − 𝑋(𝑗−1)Δ𝑡 = 0} = exp (− ∫
Δ𝑡→0

𝑗=1

𝑡 ∗ (𝑠)𝜅

𝑡0

𝐼

𝑖 (𝑠)

𝑁(𝑠)

𝑑𝑠) .

(3)

where [𝑡0 , 𝑡) was partitioned into 𝑀 equal intervals of Δ𝑡 = 𝑗(𝑡 − 𝑡0 )/𝑀, and we convert the
Riemannian sum into an integral in the limit of 𝑀 → ∞ (Δ𝑡 → 0). Finally, we apply d/d𝑡 to 1 −
ℙ{𝑇 (𝑖) > 𝑡} to obtain the probability density function (PDF) of the first-arrival time of province 𝑖:
𝑡 ∗ (𝑠)𝜅
𝐼∗ (𝑡)𝜅𝑖 (𝑡)
𝐼
(4)
𝑖 (𝑠)
PDF𝑖 (𝑡) =
exp (− ∫
𝑑𝑠).
𝑁(𝑡)
𝑁(𝑠)
𝑡0
The form of the probability density function Eq. (4) was used to estimate the likelihood of
observed arrival times in each province as a function of the growth rate 𝑟 and outbreak initiation
time 𝑡0 . This likelihood was maximized, again using differential_evolution in scipy.optimize,(1) and
the confidence intervals for 𝑟 and 𝑡0 were obtained through profile likelihood.(2) Numerical
integration was performed by discretizing time in daily time intervals, since both the flow of
travelers and the population size in Wuhan were estimated daily.
Sensitivity analyses for the ‘first-arrival’ model
4

The arrival times were fitted using three versions of the above model. Each version made a
different assumption on the probability that an infected or exposed individual having arrived at
a location be later diagnosed with coronavirus. In the first sensitivity analysis, we assumed that
this probability was 50%. In the second analysis, we assumed this probability to be 10%. Finally,
we tested the assumption that this probability was 0% for cases having arrived before Dec 31 st ,
2019, after which point new infected arrivals had a 50% probability of being later diagnosed.
The model formulation above needed a small modification to perform analyses. The event 𝑌:
“no new arrival before time 𝑡 is later diagnosed with the infection” is now equivalent to “no
arrival of an infected individual before time 𝑡”, “one infected arrival before time 𝑡 remained
undiagnosed”, “two infected arrivals before time 𝑡 remained undiagnosed”, etc. For a Poisson
process with fixed parameter 𝜆, the probability of 𝑌 can be expressed as:
∞
(1 − 𝑝)𝑘 𝜆𝑘 𝑒 −𝜆
−𝜆
(5)
ℙ(𝑌) = e + ∑
= 𝑒 −𝜆𝑝
𝑘!
𝑘=1

where 𝑝 is the probability of detection. It follows that the modified PDF formulation for
sensitivity analyses is:
𝑡 ∗ (𝑠)𝜅 (𝑠)
𝐼∗ (𝑡)𝜅𝑖 (𝑡) 𝑝
𝐼
𝑝
𝑖
PDF𝑖 (𝑡) =
exp (− ∫
𝑑𝑠).
(6)
𝑁(𝑡)
𝑁(𝑠)
𝑡0
This PDF was used instead of equation (4) to obtain maximum likelihood estimates of the growth
rate and outbreak initiation date for sensitivity analyses.
Results from sensitivity analyses
The following are the maximum likelihood estimates for the growth rate and date of outbreak
initiation in the hypothetical situations mentioned above. When the probability of detection of a
case was set to 50%, the estimated growth rate was 0.29/day, while the time of outbreak
initiation was Dec 18, 2019. The same estimates were obtained if we assumed no case could be
detected for individuals having arrived from Wuhan before Dec 31, 2019. When the probability
of detection of a case was set to 10%, the estimated growth rate remained 0.29/day, but the
estimated outbreak initiation date was Dec 12, 2019.
The ‘case count’ model: The SEIR-type hybrid stochastic model
Model 1 fitted the time of arrival of the first confirmed case of each province. We used a
different approach and a different dataset to infer disease dynamics. In particular, we
constructed a hybrid stochastic model for inferring the disease dynamics using all confirmed
cases outside Hubei. Since the measurements in Wuhan, Hubei may have been biased in early
outbreak, it is our aim to use data from outside Hubei for the inference of the growth rate 𝑟 and
the onset time 𝜏 (define 𝑡 = 0 as 0:00 am, 1/1/2020), defined as the time when the sum of
exposed and symptomatic populations ≈ 1 in Wuhan. The model is hybrid in the sense that we
will couple a deterministic and exponential growth to describe the outbreak in Wuhan and an
agent-based model which describes the discrete population dynamics of the patients after they

5

left Hubei to other provinces. We present a schematic diagram of the hybrid meta-population
model in Supplementary Fig. 6 below.
Deterministic and exponential dynamics in Wuhan
We assume an exponential growth of the number of exposed ( 𝐸𝑊 , 𝑊 for Wuhan) and
symptomatic (𝐼𝑊 ) populations in Wuhan over time, 𝐸𝑊 (𝑡) = 𝐸𝑊 (0)𝑒 𝑟𝑡 and 𝐼𝑊 (𝑡) = 𝐼𝑊 (0)𝑒 𝑟𝑡
from the onset. The overall growth rate 𝑟 is dominated by the largest eigenvalue of a sequential
compound process, and given an 𝑟 value, the ratio 𝜙 ≔ 𝐸(0)/𝐼(0) is asymptotic constant (4).
Thus, given a growth rate parameter 𝑟 and an initial condition 𝐸(𝑡0 ) + 𝐼(𝑡0 ) = 1, we numerically
−1
compute the exposed population 𝐸(𝑡) = 𝜙(𝑟) (1 + 𝜙(𝑟)) exp(𝑟(𝑡 − 𝑡0 )) and the
symptomatic population 𝐼(𝑡) = (1 + 𝜙(𝑟))

−1

exp(𝑟(𝑡 − 𝑡0 )).

Agent-based model for patients who have left Wuhan to other provinces
We assume that between 1/1 and 1/26, the populations in Wuhan are large and the dynamics
can be reasonably approximate by the above deterministic and exponentially growing curves.
However, the initial propagation of the disease to other provinces in China involves only a small
population of exposed (𝐸𝑂 , 𝑂 for Others) or symptomatic individuals who left Hubei province. In
addition, the transitions between different phases of these patients, from exposed (𝐸𝑂 ) to
symptomatic ( 𝐼𝑂 ), over to hospitalized ( 𝐻𝑂 ), and finally to be confirmed by laboratory
examinations ( 𝐶𝑂 ) in other provinces are also variable (as we quantified in Fig. 1C-F).
Consequently, the resulting population dynamics in other provinces is highly stochastic. We thus
adopt an agent-based modeling approach and rely on kinetic Monte Carlo Sampling techniques
detailed below to simulate the population dynamics in other provinces. With this approach, we
aim to generate samples of (1) each individual patient who left Wuhan at a specific date, and (2)
the individual’s health status as the time progresses (susceptible, exposed, or symptomatic). The
goal is to accumulate a large amount of Monte Carlo samples, by which we can compute the key
summary statistics, i.e., the average case reported on each day between 1/18 and 1/26, to be
compared against to the data. We achieve this by the following algorithmic procedures.
1. Generate random number of infected populations leaving Wuhan. We collected migration
index which quantifies the fraction of total populations (14 million) in Wuhan that traveled
to other provinces on each date 𝑡𝑖 = 1, … ,26 (see Table S3). Assuming independence of an
individual’s health state (susceptible, exposed, or symptomatic) and the individual’s
migration decision (leaving to other provinces or not), on each date 𝑡𝑖 , the exposed and
symptomatic populations leaving Hubei can be modeled by two Bernoulli distributions, 𝐵𝐸 =
Bernoulli(𝐸𝑊 (𝑡𝑖 ), 𝜇(𝑡𝑖 )) and 𝐵𝐼 = Bernoulli(𝐼𝑊 (𝑡𝑖 ), 𝜇(𝑡𝑖 )). Here, 𝐸𝑊 (𝑡) and 𝐼𝑊 (𝑡) are the
exposed and symptomatic population in Wuhan, and are assigned to the nearest integers to
the previously prescribed exponential growth, given model parameters (𝑟, 𝑡0 ) . Thus, to
generate one stochastic sample path (realization), we generate Bernoulli-distributed random
populations leaving Hubei on each day between 1/1 and 1/26 (both included), and model
each of these in silico patients’ health states by the following procedures.

6

Fig. S6. Schematic diagram of the proposed meta-population model. Schematic diagram of
the hybrid stochastic model. The model is a variant of the SEIR model with two geographic
compartment, Wuhan (subscripted 𝑊) and other provinces (subscripted 𝑂). In Wuhan, a
susceptible patient in compartment 𝑆𝑊 is first exposed and progresses to an exposed state
(𝐸𝑊), progressed to be infected (𝐼𝑊), hospitalized (𝐻𝑊), and then became a confirmed case
(𝐶𝑊), and either recovered (𝑅𝑊) or deceased (𝐷𝑊). A portion of ill population (𝐸𝑊 and 𝐼𝑊 )
moved to other provinces and followed a similar progression. Because these populations are
small and thus the dynamics are stochastic, we adopt an agent based approach to simulate
the disease dynamics ( 𝐸𝑂 (𝑡) , 𝐼𝑂 (𝑡) , 𝐻𝑂 (𝑡) and 𝐶𝑂 (𝑡) ) in other provinces. The case reports
on each day in other provinces were compared against the model’s output, 𝐶𝑂 (𝑡) to
constrain the unknown initial onset and growth rate in Wuhan.
2. Generate the progression of the health state for each patient: We assume that each
hypothetical patient generated by the above procedure would stochastically, identically and
independently progress toward to be confirmed ( 𝐶𝑂 ) and reported in one of the other
provinces. If an individual was exposed (𝐸𝑂 ) when s/he left Hubei at 𝑡𝑖 , we generate a Gamma
distributed random time Δ𝑡𝐸→𝐼 ∼ Γ(𝛼1 , 𝛽1 ) and update the individual’s health state to
symptomatic (𝐼𝑂 ) at time 𝑡𝑖 + Δ𝑡𝐸→𝐼 . We chose a time-dependent waiting-time distribution
for the progression from symptomatic sate 𝐼𝑂 to reflect the two regimes we observed from
the data (see main text): If 𝑡𝑖 + Δ𝑡𝐸→𝐼 is before 1/18 (included), we generate a Gamma
distributed random time Δ𝑡𝐼→𝐻 ∼ Γ(𝛼2,1 , 𝛽2,1 ) to model the waiting time for an infected
patient to be hospitalized (otherwise, if it is later than 1/18, Δ𝑡𝐼→𝐻 ∼ Γ(𝛼2,2 , 𝛽2,2 ) ).
Consequently, the patient’s state is changed to 𝐻𝑂 at time 𝑡𝑖 + Δ𝑡𝐸→𝐼 + Δ𝑡𝐼→𝐻 . If 𝑡𝑖 +
Δ𝑡𝐸→𝐼 + Δ𝑡𝐼→𝐻 is before 1/19, the patient would wait in the “H” state until 1/19 when the
policy of case confirmation was announced and institutionalized. Then, the confirmation
process is modelled by another Gamma distributed random time Δ𝑡𝐻→𝐶 ∼ Γ(𝛼3 , 𝛽3 ). The
patient is then confirmed and reported at time 𝑡𝑖 + Δ𝑡𝐸→𝐼 + Δ𝑡𝐼→𝐻 + Δt 𝐻→𝐶 , and we add one
more case report at the next integer (date of January). Similar procedure applied to a patient
who had already progressed to the 𝐼𝑊 state before s/he left Hubei on date 𝑡𝑖 , with the
exception that the first random waiting time is neglected—the patient’s confirmation time
would be 𝑡𝑖 + Δ𝑡𝐼→𝐻 + Δ𝐻→𝐶 . We repeat the procedure for each in-silico patient who left

7

Wuhan between 1/1 and 1/26 (both included), and register the time when these patients
were reported between 1/18 and 1/26 (both included).
Parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification of (𝑟, 𝑡0 )
It is our task to infer the unknown parameters, exponential growth rate 𝑟 and exponential
growth onset time 𝑡0 by the number of confirmed cases reported between 1/18 and 1/26. This
is possible because the information of the unknown parameters (𝑟, 𝑡0 ) have an impact of the
deterministic growths of the exposed 𝐸𝑊 (𝑡) and symptomatic population 𝐼𝑊 (𝑡), which in turn
have an impact on the random populations which have left Hubei on each date. These
populations follow statistically quantified processes until the final confirmation outside of Hubei,
and can be compared against the reported data.
An error measure is devised to assess the quality of fit of the model given a set of parameters
(𝑟, 𝑡0 ) by the following procedures. For each parameter set, we generate 213 = 8192 Monte
Carlo samples. On each date 𝑡𝑖 , the 𝑗 th sample reports a random number 𝑛𝐶𝑀𝐶 (𝑡_𝑖|𝑟, 𝑡0 , 𝑗) of
confirmed new cases. We thus average over all the samples and obtain an averaged number of
𝑀𝐶
newly confirmed cases on a date 𝑡𝑖 , 𝑛𝐶𝑀𝐶 (𝑡𝑖 |𝑟, 𝑡0 ) ≔ ∑8192
𝑗=1 𝑛𝐶 (𝑡𝑖 |𝑟, 𝑡0 , 𝑗), and compare it to the
actual data 𝑛𝐶𝐷𝑎𝑡𝑎 (𝑡𝑖 ). We quantify the quality of the fit by computing the sum of the squared
residuals:
26
2

𝜀 2 (𝑟, 𝑡0 ) ≔ ∑ [𝑛𝐶𝑀𝐶 (𝑡𝑖 |𝑟, 𝑡0 ) − 𝑛𝐶𝐷𝑎𝑡𝑎 (𝑡𝑖 )] .

(7)

𝑡𝑖 =18

A 100 × 100 grid-based parameter scan is performed to identify the parameters in the
region 0.22 < 𝑟 < 0.42 and −20 ≤ 𝑡0 ≤ −5 for identifying the best-fit parameters:
𝑟 ∗ , 𝑡0∗ ≔ argmin{𝑟,𝑡0} 𝜀 2 (𝑟, 𝑡0 ).
(8)
As for uncertainty quantification, we formulate the logarithm of the likelihood ℒ of a parameter
set (𝑟, 𝑡0 ) as
log ℒ (𝛼, 𝜏) ≔ −𝑛

𝜀 2 (𝑟, 𝑡0 )
.
𝜀 2 (𝑟 ∗ , 𝑡0∗ )

(9)

Here, 𝑛 = 9 is the number of data points we use to fit the model. The assumption we make to
formulate the above likelihood is that (1) the data (number reported new cases on date 𝑡𝑖 ) is
normally distributed with a mean which equals to the Monte Carlo mean reported new cases in
our model, and (2) the variance of the noise is identically and 𝑡𝑖 -independently distributed, and
the variance is equal to the mean squared residuals of the best-fit model.
We can then formulate a likelihood ratio test, which quantifies how likely a set of parameters
(𝑟, 𝑡0 ) is in comparison to the best-fit parameters (𝑟 ∗ , 𝑡0∗ ):
ℙ{𝑟, 𝑡0 | 𝐷𝑎𝑡𝑎} ∼ exp [−𝑛 (1 −

𝜀 2 (𝑟, 𝑡0 )
)] .
𝜀 2 (𝑟 ∗ , 𝑡0∗ )

(10)

In Bayesian inference, what we computed is essentially the joint posterior distribution of the
model parameters (𝑟, 𝑡0 ), provided a uniform prior distribution on the region of our interests.
We present this joint distribution in Supplementary Fig. S4. Finally, because the joint posterior is

8

narrowly

distributed,

we

can

numerically

compute

ℙ{𝑟 | 𝐷𝑎𝑡𝑎} ∼ ∫ ℙ{𝑟, 𝑡0 | 𝐷𝑎𝑡𝑎} d𝑡0 ,

the

posterior,

(11)

ℙ{𝑡0 | 𝐷𝑎𝑡𝑎} ∼ ∫ ℙ{𝑟, 𝑡0 | 𝐷𝑎𝑡𝑎} d𝑟,

which is reported in Fig. 2D-F and used to calculate the bounds of centered 95% probability mass
to estimate the confidence interval of the growth rate 𝑟.
Calculation of R0 from exponential growth rate
Assuming gamma distributions for the latent and infectious periods, Wearing et al. (4) have
shown that the value of R0 can be calculated from estimated exponential growth rate, r, of an
outbreak as:
𝑅0 =

𝑚
𝑟
𝑟 (𝜎𝑚 + 1)

−𝑛 ,
𝑟
𝛾 [1 − (𝛾𝑛 + 1) ]

(12)

where 1/𝜎 and 1/𝛾 are the mean latent and infectious periods, respectively, and 𝑚 and 𝑛
are the shape parameters for the gamma distributions for the mean latent and infectious periods,
respectively.
To quantify the uncertainty of 𝑅0 , we assume the parameters (𝑟, 𝜎, 𝛾, 𝑚, 𝑛) are mutually
independent and we generate random samples to compute the resulting 𝑅0 . Specifically, we
generate the samples according to
1. 𝑟 ∼ ℙ{𝛼 | 𝐷𝑎𝑡𝑎}, i.e., we resample the posterior distribution from Eq. (11),
2. 𝑚 = 4.5,
3. 𝑛 ∼ Unif(1,6),
4. 1/𝛾 ∼ Unif(2,8) in the first scenario, and Unif(4,10) in the second scenario.
5. 𝜎 ∼ 𝒩(𝜇 = 1/4.2, 𝜎 = 0.0245) in the first scenario, and 𝒩(𝜇 = 1/2.2, 𝜎 = 0.0468).
we generate 105 parameters and compute their respective 𝑅0 using Eq. (12). The resulting
evaluation were binned into 40 bins to generate histograms. We used the 97.5% and 2.5%
percentile of the generate data to quantify the 95% confidence interval.
Calculation of the impact of intervention strategies
Using a susceptible–exposed (noninfectious)– infectious–recovered (SEIR) type
compartmental model, Lipsitch et al. (5) evaluated the impact of quarantine of symptomatic
cases to prevent further transmission and quarantine and close observation of asymptomatic
contacts of cases so that they may be isolated when they show possible signs of the disease.
Assuming that only symptomatic individuals transmit the pathogen, they showed that the
reproductive number after the intervention, 𝑅𝑖𝑛𝑡 , can be expressed as:
𝑅𝑖𝑛𝑡 =

𝑅 (1 − 𝑞)𝐷𝑖𝑛𝑡
,
𝐷

(13)

9

where 𝑅 is the reproductive number before intervention, 𝑞 is the percentage of infected
individuals being quarantined, 𝐷𝑖𝑛𝑡 and 𝐷 are the mean durations of infectious period after
intervention and without intervention, respectively.
Here in our model, we adopted this formulation; however, we assumed that a fraction, 𝑓, of
infected individuals are asymptomatic and can transmit. In this case, quarantine of symptomatic
individuals only reduces the contribution of these individuals towards the reproductive number.
Thus, we can calculate the reproductive number under quarantine, 𝑅𝑞 , as:
𝑅𝑞 = 𝑓𝑅 + (1 − 𝑓)𝑅𝑖𝑛𝑡 = 𝑅 (𝑓 + (1 − 𝑓)(1 − 𝑞)

𝐷𝑖𝑛𝑡
).
𝐷

(14)

We also considered another form of control measure, i.e. the population-level control measure
that reduces overall number of daily contacts in the population by 𝜀. These measures include
closing down of transportation systems, work and/or school closure, etc. Since R depends linearly
on the number of daily contacts, we calculate the combined impact of the individual-based
quarantine and the population level control measure as:
𝑅𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑏𝑖𝑛𝑒 = (1 − 𝜀)[𝑓𝑅 + (1 − 𝑓)𝑅𝑖𝑛𝑡 ] = (1 − 𝜀)𝑅 (𝑓 + (1 − 𝑓)(1 − 𝑞)

𝐷𝑖𝑛𝑡
).
𝐷

(15)

In our calculations, we assumed that the mean duration of infectious period of 2019-nCoV to be
5 days, i.e. 𝐷=5 days and that 𝐷𝑖𝑛𝑡 = 2 days. We set the value of 𝑅 to be the maximum likelihood
estimate of 𝑅0. Then the impact of the two types of interventions are calculated.
Fitting the number of new cases in and out of Hubei
To infer the growth rate of the number of new cases, we used linear regression over the logtransformed case counts. We used the day in January 2020 as an independent variable. For this
specific analysis, we avoided using case frequencies < 10 because infection dynamics may have
been dominated by stochasticity. For cases inside Hubei, we used the number of cases reported
between Jan. 16 and Feb. 4. For cases outside of Hubei, we used the number of cases reported
between Jan 20. and Feb. 4. To assess whether a different growth rate was observed after Jan 25
outside of Hubei, we evaluated the significance of the interaction term between variable day and
the index variable for dates Jan 25 and beyond; the results are presented in Fig. 3C. All regressions
and confidence interval estimates were obtained through software R.
