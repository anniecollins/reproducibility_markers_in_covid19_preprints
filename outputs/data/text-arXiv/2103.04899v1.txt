ABSTRACT
To allow previewing a web page, social media platforms have developed social cards: visualizations consisting of vital information
about the underlying resource. At a minimum, social cards often
include features such as the web resource’s title, text summary,
striking image, and domain name. News and scholarly articles on
the web are frequently subject to social card creation when being shared on social media. However, we noticed that not all web
resources offer sufficient metadata elements to enable appealing
social cards. For example, the COVID-19 emergency has made it
clear that scholarly articles, in particular, are at an aesthetic disadvantage in social media platforms when compared to their often
more flashy disinformation rivals. Also, social cards are often not
generated correctly for archived web resources, including pages that
lack or predate standards for specifying striking images. With these
observations, we are motivated to quantify the levels of inclusion
of required metadata in web resources, its evolution over time for
archived resources, and create and evaluate an algorithm to automatically select a striking image for social cards. We find that more
than 40% of archived news articles sampled from the NEWSROOM
dataset and 22% of scholarly articles sampled from the PubMed
Central dataset fail to supply striking images. We demonstrate that
we can automatically predict the striking image with a 𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛@1
of 0.83 for news articles from NEWSROOM and 0.78 for scholarly
articles from the open access journal PLOS ONE.

INTRODUCTION

Understanding the content behind a URL is important for web discourse. Though users might infer meaning from URLs, summaries
are more effective. To provide these summaries, social media platforms provide social cards, as shown in Figure 1. Social cards

provide different pieces of information to summarize the underlying content. These social card units typically consist of a title,
a small text summary, a striking image, and a domain name that,
in aggregate, summarize the page behind a URL. Social cards are
similar to snippets in search engine result pages (SERPs) but have
a slightly different purpose. Where search engine result snippets
typically are dynamically contextualized based on the query and
answer the question of “Will this meet my information need?”,
social cards are static and address the question “What does the
underlying page contain?” Both allow for previewing a page and
allow pages to “compete for clicks” relative to rivals that might be
present elsewhere on the page. Textual information is important,
but a good striking image can also help readers better understand
the underlying document [15]. As shown in the Twitter card from
Figure 1, the title and description give the reader some idea of the
information found in the underlying page, but the striking image
provides the additional insight of a current map of COVID-19 infection locations, helping the user infer that not only is a visualization
available at this resource, but that it is also updated to contain
current information.
In 2010, Facebook and Twitter established HTML metadata standards so page authors could supply their own values for social
card units. However, we have observed that not all web pages offer
sufficient information to generate helpful cards. Compare the card
in Figure 2 showing no image or descriptive metadata with the one
in Figure 3 that contains content for all social card units. The latter
is more alluring and provides disinformation, whereas the former
is a Nature article providing peer-reviewed research, illustrating
the phenomena detailed in “The Truth Is Paywalled But The Lies
Are Free” [30]. To facilitate the spread of accurate information,
social cards can help by making such content more accessible. In
the future, scholars will review the COVID-19 pandemic via web
archives and their captures of specific observations of web pages.
In prior work [14], we analyzed more than 60 platforms and determined that none reliably generated social cards for archived web
pages. The roughly 150 billion web pages captured by the Internet
Archive before 2010 [3] likely have none of the 2010 standardized
metadata. In this work, we will show how 40% of our sample of
archived news articles and 22% of our sample of scholarly articles
fail to specify striking images. Even though it appears that 78% of
scholarly articles contain striking images, we note that 74% of them
reuse the same image among multiple articles and 52% of journals
reuse the same image for all of their articles — often a publisher or
journal logo that does not summarize the article content. The lack of
metadata and use of unsuitable images requires social card creation
tools to automatically generate descriptions and select striking images for these documents. This fact along with the observed lack of
platform support for creating cards for archived pages, the large
number of pages that predate these metadata standards, and personal experience with poor support for some scholarly articles (e.g.,
Figure 2) inspired the research in this paper.
Some of the endeavors benefiting from this research are social
media storytelling, carousels for content management systems, and
news aggregation platforms. To quantify this problem effectively,
we analyzed news articles and scholarly publications — resources
that have undergone editorial review and, presumably, received

some care in their publication. News articles and scholarly publications are also frequent sources for social cards on social media.
Thus, in the following research questions, we contrast results between news articles (stored in the Internet Archive) with open
access journal articles:
Research Question #1 (RQ1) - What are the distributions of
HTML metadata elements (general and social card elements) in
news articles (over time) and scholarly publications published on
the web?
Research Question #2 (RQ2) - What approaches and image
features are best suited to automatically select striking images from
news articles and scholarly publications, and do the approaches
differ for both resource types?

BACKGROUND

As shown in Figure 1, full social cards consist of a page title, striking image, domain name, and description. To allow authors to
supply their own values for these units, both Facebook and Twitter have developed the respective Open Graph Protocol (OGP) [9]
and Twitter card [35] standards. To supply a value for a social
card unit, a web page author inserts the key-value pairs into the attributes of an HTML META element (e.g., <META property="og:image"
content="http://example/image.png">). Table 1 lists the standard
fields to be used with each social card unit. Most fields are optional,
and cards will omit missing data, as seen in Figure 2. From our experience, Twitter requires that twitter:card and twitter:title
or og:title exist or it will not create a card. Facebook is more
forgiving, generating a card consisting only of the content of a
page’s HTML title element and domain name if no metadata
fields are specified. With the exception of twitter:card, if any
other twitter:* fields are missing, Twitter will use the values of
a corresponding og:* field if present [36]. Deprecated or undocumented equivalents, such as twitter:image:url, may also be
interpreted by the corresponding social media service. If present,
Facebook favors the value of og:title over the content of the
page’s title element. The OGP specification states that Facebook
should generate a card containing a description if og:description
is present, but based on our experience, Facebook will provide a
description in its card only if both og:description and og:image
are present. This paper analyzes metadata per the specification.
If the author wishes to specify a striking image, they apply the
appropriate field and image URL value to their META element. If
a striking image URL is not specified, then a social card creation
tool has a few options. It could display a default image in the card,
as shown in Figure 2, providing no meaning for the end user and
indicating that it found no striking image metadata field. Alternatively, it could render the web page in a browser and capture it as a
screenshot, an artifact also known as a browser thumbnail. Finally,
a tool can evaluate all of the images from the page and choose one,
a technique we refer to in this paper as striking image prediction. For example, Blogger applies the simple approach of choosing
the first image found within a post’s content. Our recent work
demonstrated [15] that social cards probably perform better than
screenshots for understanding; thus, we are analyzing approaches
for the last option, striking image prediction. To achieve the best

results, we analyze two different types of documents that are not
well represented in other striking image prediction studies.
Archived web pages, or mementos, contain a document’s original HTML and images downloaded at some time in the past, recorded
as the memento’s memento-datetime [37]. This memento-datetime
represents when the archive captured the memento and when the
archive observed its properties, allowing us to examine web authors’ behavior in the past. It is not necessarily the same as the
publication date since archiving can occur well after publication.
Sometimes the capture process fails to fully render a page, causing
missing stylesheets, images, or JavaScript when an end user revisits
the memento, a phenomenon called memento-damage [4]. We refer to the URLs identifying these unchanging mementos as URI-Ms.
Each URI-M identifies a capture of a specific version of a changing,
live web resource known as the memento’s corresponding original
resource, identified by a URI-R [37]. Because of the problems with
reliably generating cards for mementos [14], we created the social
card creation tool MementoEmbed. We will update MementoEmbed
with the results from this paper.
For RQ1, we use the NEWSROOM dataset [10] developed by
Grusky et al. for evaluating automatic text summarization algorithms against news articles. NEWSROOM contains 1.3 million
URI-Ms of news articles for which there are textual summaries
present in the article’s HTML META elements. These textual summaries may come from the *:description fields shown in Table
1 or they may be specified in the standard HTML META element
description field. The NEWSROOM dataset represents captures
from 1998 through 2016 of news articles from 29 news outlets.
Also for RQ1, we examine scholarly publications as a contrast
with our results for news articles. A digital object identifier (DOI)
is a persistent identifier for locating a scholarly article regardless
of website redesigns, corporate publisher acquisitions, and other
phenomena that lead to broken links. Our work focuses on the
HTML landing pages and HTML articles of open access scholarly
publications. We acquired the PubMed Central (PMC) open access
commercial use dataset [24] consisting of 1.7 million open access
articles formatted as XML or plain text files. From these files, we
extracted the DOIs, dereferenced them to download their HTML
counterparts, and then analyzed the results. These articles are not
mementos but are current versions of these scholarly publications.
While DOI resolution on the web is not always reliable [17], we used
the same request methods and HTTP clients to obtain consistent
results.
For RQ2, we reuse a subset of the NEWSROOM dataset for news
articles. As we mentioned in the Introduction and will show in Section 4.2, most of the articles in the PMC dataset do not provide good
ground truth for striking images. Instead, we use all 227,265 articles

from the open access journal PLOS ONE found in the PMC dataset
for evaluating striking image prediction. We chose to analyze the
articles from PLOS ONE because their submission guidelines [25]
encourage each article’s author(s) to choose a striking image from
their article to represent it. PLOS ONE also has other benefits, such
as standardized URL patterns for detecting figures, tables, and equations within the document. This capability allowed us to produce
a more intelligent image prediction approach that could discard
images such as the PLOS logo, ORCID logo, and advertisements.

RELATED WORK

Automatic image selection has been applied to the reduction of
a large set of images to a small set for building photo albums
[26], selecting representative pages from historical manuscripts
[7], choosing the best key frame to represent a video [8, 28], generating collages [31] and general image collection summarization
[34]. Individual image selection has been applied to detecting specific categories of images, such as spam [22], advertisements [5], or
landscapes [12], and coarsely identifying specific principal image
subjects, such as vehicle or pet [16]. None of these solutions attempt
to find the striking image that summarizes a single web page.
In 2004, Hu and Bragga [13] analyzed the front page of 25 randomly selected news sites and classified the images into seven categories. A story image provides a striking image for a set of news
articles covering a specific story. Preview images provide striking
images for specific articles. Commercial images are advertisements.
Host images provide a photograph of an author. Heading images are
navigational elements consisting of stylized text. Icon logos provide
branding for the whole news source or a specific feature of the
publication. Formatting images perform the function of shaping or
arranging a page, and examples include transparent spacing images or graphical horizontal rules, largely an artifact of the limited
formatting abilities of the HTML of that era. The authors manually
annotated 899 images across these 25 front pages. Their SVM classifier achieved an accuracy of 92.5% when combining the discrete
cosine transforms of each image with the values of its color bands
and the surrounding text’s properties.
In 2006, Maekawa, Hara, and Nishio [23] analyzed forty websites and categorized 3,901 images into eleven categories. They
then applied a custom classifier to the problem and achieved an
accuracy rate of 83.1% across categories. Maekawa’s goal was to
classify images so that mobile browsers could avoid the unnecessary download of images that would not display well on the smaller
displays of mobile devices. Many of their categories are similar to
Hu’s. Their solution relies on easy-to-calculate features like width,
height, byte size, number of colors, content type, and aspect ratio,
but they also include the number of images on the page with similar
features and textual information. While their overall accuracy is
83.1%, they do poorly for certain categories, such as an 𝐹 1 score of
0.458 for identifying buttons and 0.694 for advertisements.
Li, Shi, and Zhang [21] ran an experiment in 2008 that is more
similar to our work. They were interested in identifying striking images for search results. Their dominant image is similar to our concept of a striking image. For ground truth, they randomly sampled
3,000 documents from a dataset of pages from msn.com, mit.edu,

Jones, et al.

and cnn.com. They then asked three participants to label each image as dominant or non-dominant. With this training data, they
applied a custom classifier to predict the class of each image on a
page. They used the features of pixel size, aspect ratio, sharpness,
contrast, number of colors, categorization of photo or graphic with
or without a human face, content-type, position on the page, size
of image compared to the size of the page rendered in a browser,
number of images larger than this image on a page, if the image
came from an external site, and if the image repeats across the same
web site. Their classifier calculates a relevance score for each image
on the page based on the user’s query with an accuracy of 0.85.
Koh and Kerne [18] took a different approach. It starts by analyzing the HTML document’s DOM. It finds the deepest nodes and
works its way back up to discover the nodes most likely to contain
content. From here, they choose the largest image with the smallest
aspect ratio based on empirically determined thresholds. Based on
human labeling, their algorithm achieves an accuracy of 0.898 and
an 𝐹 1 of 0.921 across datasets of web pages consisting of 239 news
pages and 254 research pages.
Our work differs from that of Hu, Maekawa, Li, and Koh in several ways. Where Hu analyzed the front pages of news sources,
we work with individual articles (i.e., deep links within the site).
Unlike Hu and Maekawa, we are trying to find a single striking
image to summarize the page rather than classifying images into
multiple categories. We do not manually label images to develop
our ground truth dataset; instead, we rely upon the actual image
selected as part of the document’s editorial review process as found
in the og:image or twitter:image fields. Unlike Li’s work, our
method does not require a search query for selecting a striking
image. We are inspired by many of the features chosen by all of this
prior work. Unfortunately, some of these features are impossible to
calculate reliably for our chosen documents. Mementos offer many
challenges. For example, analyzing the images available on other
pages from the same website may be impossible because the web
archive did not capture other pages of the same website. Additionally, features that require rendering in a browser, like comparing
page size to image size, may fail due to memento damage. Koh
and Kerne are the only ones in this list to consider anything like
scholarly publications. They did not process journal articles or conference proceedings but instead analyzed web pages from Scientific
American, IBM Research, and Los Alamos National Laboratory. Their
solution will only work for HTML documents that contain images
of varying sizes and aspect ratios. Our PLOS One dataset contains
many images whose size and aspect ratio are very similar, making
it challenging to apply their solution.

DISTRIBUTION OF METADATA ELEMENTS

To address RQ1 we sampled news articles from the NEWSROOM
dataset and scholarly articles from the PMC dataset.

4.1

News Articles

We discovered that the 1.3 million article NEWSROOM dataset was
unbalanced with respect to domain name and memento-datetime.
For example, NEWSROOM has 186,095 mementos from nytimes.com
and 1,429 mementos from economist.com. In terms of mementodatetime year, NEWSROOM contained 19 mementos from 1998

and 279,232 from 2016. Most of the mementos in the dataset come
from 2016, making up 23% of the dataset, and the percentage of
mementos for each year decreases (e.g., 19% for 2015, 13% for 2014,
10% for 2012). OGP came into existence in 2010 [11] and Twitter
will use that standard. Because the number of mementos in the
NEWSROOM dataset are more heavily biased toward years closer
to 2016 and we wanted to contrast metadata usage before and after
card standards were published, we added all 90,570 NEWSROOM
articles with memento-datetimes from 2009 and before to our sample. For those after 2010, we created a bucket for each domain and
memento-datetime year. We randomly chose URI-Ms until we filled
each domain/year bucket to a size of 1,307 — the median size of all
domain/year divisions after 2010. Our sample size after this process
was 310,163 mementos.
We downloaded this sample in June 2020. To lessen the chance of
being rate limited by the Internet Archive, we divided the URI-Ms
in the sample into seven subsets and spread them across different
servers in Amsterdam, Frankfurt, London, New York, Northern Virginia, San Francisco, and Toronto. We felt confident in this approach
because the Internet Archive presents the content it recorded and
does not alter it for different geographic locations. To address failed
downloads caused by rate limiting, we repeated the downloads
once in July and again in August 2020. We discovered that the
downloads with HTTP status codes of 400, 403, 404, and 405 were
indeed captures of pages with those status codes. Some mementos
redirected to mementos captured after 2016, similar to behavior
that Ainsorth et al. [2] reported in a different set of mementos. We
removed all mementos captured after 2016. After resolving these
issues, as shown in Table 2, our downloaded NEWSROOM sample
consisted of 277,724 mementos.

Table 3 lists the number of mementos in the NEWSROOM sample capable of creating different combinations of social card units.
Because Facebook is more forgiving with missing fields, 59.56% of
articles can create a full card on Facebook, while only 43.86% can do
so with Twitter. We assigned each metadata field encountered to a
category based on its corresponding standard or usage. We removed
all instances where metadata fields were specific to a domain (e.g.,
only nytimes.com used the metadata field byl). Figure 4 demonstrates how these categories changed over time. There is a focus on
HTML standard metadata over time throughout our sample because
all mementos in the NEWSROOM dataset contain at least a textual
summary in some form, and before the OGP or Twitter standards,
these articles used the HTML standard description field. We observed that news articles rapidly adopted social card metadata fields,
starting with 13.13% adoption of OGP in 2010 and reaching 93.05%
by 2016. After 2010, there is a rise in all types of metadata usage,
focusing on search engines, mobile apps, browser customization,
and social media, showing that news articles leveraged promotion
of their content once standard metadata fields became available.

4.2

Scholarly Publications

The PMC dataset of 1.7 million articles was organized by journal. To
equalize the numbers per journal, we randomly sampled 100 DOIs
from each journal’s articles in the dataset. To avoid rate limiting,
we downloaded these articles’ landing pages from servers located
in the English-speaking locations of London, San Francisco, New
York, and Toronto. We ensured that we equally represented each
journal at each location. Table 4 shows how we were able to build a
dataset of 110,900 articles in August 2020 for metadata analysis. This
sample represents 1,109 journals from 209 publishers. These were
not mementos but current web resources. Many of these articles
are not stored in web archives, so we could not analyze metadata
usage over time.
Table 5 summarizes our analysis of card capability within the
PMC sample. Only 36.74% of articles can create a full card, including
striking image, on Twitter, while 77.86% can do so on Facebook.
Even though it appears that striking images for cards are well
established for Facebook, 68,761/110,900 (73.98%) articles reuse the
same og:image value as another article. Most of these striking
images were journal or publisher logos. In fact, 572/1109 (51.6%)
journals used the same URL for og:image with every article. Thus,
few publishers use an image from the document’s content and
instead favor publisher or journal promotion. This contrasts with

As we did with our NEWSROOM sample, we placed all metadata fields in the PMC sample into categories. Because these are
current web resources, we could not show growth over time, so
we ranked them instead. Facebook card metadata came in fourth
place at 77.86% of the dataset. Third place went to Dublin Core
with 97,090/110,900 (87.55%) articles. Standard HTML fields like
keywords and referrer came in second place with 102,704/110,900
(92.61%) articles. In first place, 104,014/110,900 (93.79%) articles applied metadata from Highwire Press, a metadata standard favored
by Google Scholar [1].

STRIKING IMAGE PREDICTION

The numbers of mementos and scholarly articles lacking any meaningful striking image led to RQ2. Our overall goal was to find the
approach that, given a set of images, will select the image closest to
what a human selected, as found in the metadata, for the same document, regardless of whether or not that image also exists outside
of the metadata. The striking images found in the metadata are our
ground truth because the document’s editorial process produced
them.
Thus, any dataset applied to this endeavor requires documents
where all images are available, and all documents must contain at
least one striking image. This disqualifies documents that we cannot
download or cannot parse with BeautifulSoup [29] and documents
with images that we cannot process with Pillow [6] or ImageMagick
[33]. We also disqualify documents with only one image because
we have no prediction to make, and these easy wins may skew
results. For each document, we consider image URLs found in the
META elements from the HEAD as well as those provided by the src
and srcset attributes of each IMG element found in the BODY.
For analyzing news articles, we started with our NEWSROOM
sample of 310,163 mementos. As shown in Table 6, the issues we
encountered left us with 37,522 articles to evaluate. The fact that
we lose much of our dataset to download issues further emphasizes that many mementos can benefit from automatic striking
image prediction because some of their images may be missing or
corrupted.
As mentioned in Section 2 and demonstrated in Section 4.2, the
PMC dataset was unsuitable for striking image prediction because
the ground truth was poor or non-existent. We instead used a subset
of the PMC dataset consisting of 227,265 PLOS ONE articles because

of their quality striking images. PLOS ONE’s standardized URL
patterns allowed us to produce a smarter image prediction approach
that could discard images such as the PLOS logo or advertisements.
We produced an HTML scraper that processes PLOS ONE articles
with these patterns in mind. We did not consider images found
in supplemental sections or appendices. Table 7 lists the issues
we encountered when attempting to download and process these
articles in July 2020, leaving us with 198,523 articles.
Once we had our datasets, we applied different prediction approaches. Each prediction approach required one or more image
features (e.g., byte size) to be successful. Some approaches choose

the image with the highest or lowest value for the feature (e.g.,
largest or smallest byte size). For comparison with all approaches,
we also ran 20 trials where we randomly chose each document’s
striking image.
Base features. Because social card creation tools must operate
in real-time, we considered image features that could be calculated

quickly. The Pillow library provides the following features for all
image formats:
image byte size
image width in pixels
image height in pixels
the number of columns in the image’s histogram with a value
of 0 (negative space)
• image size in pixels
• the image’s aspect ratio
• the number of colors in the image
•
•
•
•

In an attempt to achieve better results, we also supplied multiple
features as input to various scikit-learn [27] classifiers. When training classifiers, we placed images found in the HTML metadata into
the class of present-in-metadata and other images into the class of
other. When testing classifiers, we considered each document to
be its own test case. We supplied the features of each image in a
document to the classifier and asked it to provide the probability
that the image comes from the class present-in-metadata. From that
set, we choose the image that has the highest probability of being
in the class present-in-metadata as the predicted striking image
for that document. We chose this probability method so that each
document contains at least one striking image prediction. If we had
merely evaluated how well the classifier predicted an image’s class
(present-in-metadata or other), there would be documents for which
the classifier found no striking image. With our method, even a
low probability of belonging to present-in-metadata still predicts a
striking image because all of the document’s images’ probabilities
are compared.
Social card creation tools have to contend with many different
types of images. The values for some image features, like byte
size, have no upper bound, making proper scaling challenging to
estimate for the long term. Scaling can also remove precision from
some measures, leading to poor results. Thus, we only considered
the following classifiers because their scikit-learn implementations
provide class probability scores and they do not require scaling:
•
•
•
•
•
•

AdaBoost
Decision Tree
Gaussian Naive Bayes
Linear Discrimant Analysis
Logistic Regression
Random Forest

We evaluate classifier operation with 10-fold cross-validation
by document. Instead of evaluating how well each prediction approach predicts an image’s class (present-in-metadata or other), we
instead evaluate how well, given a set of images found in a document, the approach selects the ground truth striking image for
that document. This leads us away from considering metrics like 𝐹 1
because they invite discussions about what recall means in this application. Instead, we consider other metrics commonly associated
with information retrieval because we consider each document a
query and the output of a prediction approach as a set of ranked
results where the striking images are the relevant results. Thus, we
apply 𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛@1 (𝑃@1) to determine the given approach’s level
of success for predicting the striking image from the metadata. If an
approach produces a relevant result as its first result for a document,
the 𝑃@1 score for that document and approach is 1, and 0 otherwise.

We take the mean of the 𝑃@1 scores for all documents, making
𝑃@1 a proxy for accuracy. We also supply Mean Reciprocal Rank
(𝑀𝑅𝑅) to evaluate how well an approach performed even if it failed
to achieve 𝑃@1 = 1.0 for a document. For a given document, we
determine the rank of the first relevant image (𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑘𝑖 ) as provided by
1 ).
the approach under test and compute the rank’s reciprocal ( 𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑘
𝑖
We then compute the mean of all of these reciprocal ranks across
all documents for the same approach. For example, if 10 images
exist in a document and the approach ranks a relevant image in
fourth place, then the reciprocal rank is 14 = 0.25. A score of 1.0 for
𝑃@1 and 𝑀𝑅𝑅 is ideal.
We recognize that the same image may exist at different URLs
or the striking image may be a cropped or resized form of the same
image elsewhere in the document. For these issues, we apply a
perceptive hash (pHash) distance to our evaluation as a proxy for
human judgment of image similarity. If an approach selects image
𝐴, but the ground truth image is 𝐵, and if 𝑝𝐻𝑎𝑠ℎ𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 (𝐴, 𝐵) = 0,
then we consider 𝐴 to be just as relevant when computing 𝑃@1
and 𝑀𝑅𝑅.
Different pHash implementations exist. We evaluated ImageHash’s pHash [20], ImageMagick’s pHash [32, 38], and Zauner’s
pHash [39]. We manually reviewed the intra- and inter-document
similarity distances provided by each pHash implementation for the
images found in 10 news and 10 scholarly articles. We concluded
that ImageMagick’s pHash provided the most intuitive similarity
distances because it placed photographs at the same distance to
each other, separate from logos and text. ImageMagick’s pHash was
more consistent with considering cropped or resized images to be
similar to their original form. ImageMagick’s pHash scores are not
scaled and reached values as high as 6000 during this evaluation. We
noted that, while low scores intuitively indicated similar images, as
scores reached higher values there is a greater discrepancy between
the scores and human perception, thus we needed an upper bound
for scaling that kept this discrepancy in mind. Our median score
from this 20 article evaluation was 280.904. We scaled all distance
scores such that scores above twice the median (561.808) became
1.0 and other scores are the result of dividing their value by 561.808.
ImageMagick has an issue processing certain JPEGs [19], so we
converted all images to PNGs before computing the pHash distance.

Results of Predicting Striking Images For
News Articles

Figure 5a demonstrates the performance of different prediction
approaches with the NEWSROOM sample. Each line demonstrates
the increasing 𝑀𝑅𝑅 or 𝑃@1 score, identified by its points’ y-axis
values, as produced by an evaluation that we performed at the
corresponding pHash distance on the x-axis. When we evaluate
at a pHash distance of 1.0, any image selected by the approach is
equivalent to the ground truth; thus, 𝑀𝑅𝑅 and 𝑃@1 are 1. At a
pHash distance of 0, only images that are perceptively equal to the
ground truth image are relevant. The best approach achieves the
highest 𝑀𝑅𝑅 and 𝑃@1 at the lowest pHash distance, resulting in
lines that start in the upper left quadrant of each graph.
Randomly choosing images gives poor performance at a pHash
distance of 0 with 𝑀𝑅𝑅 = 0.4016, 𝑃@1 = 0.1551. Training Random
Forest with all base features results in the best performance at a

we could improve performance with fewer features, we applied
Spearman’s 𝜌 to our features, as shown in Table 8. We see that
aspect ratio and negative space have the lowest correlation. We
retrained Random Forest with these features removed and achieved
𝑀𝑅𝑅 = 0.8782, 𝑃@1 = 0.8267 at a pHash distance of 0. Removing
additional features produced results with 𝑃@1 < 0.8.

Results of Predicting Striking Images For
Scholarly Publications

Scholarly publications have additional features not available in webbased news publications. To improve our chances of discovering
a meaningful striking image, we only included images that had
captions and were directly cited in the paper. This decision excludes
equations, which were never a striking image in the PLOS ONE
dataset. Equations as images is an artifact of HTML being incapable
of reliably rendering mathematical notation. This left graphics and

the positions of the earliest reference, by character or word, from
any section where the figure is referenced in the paper.
Caption features. Performing text analysis on captions may
indicate which figure is most important and thus a good candidate
for the striking image. For each paper, we used NLTK to generate a
list of all words, with stopwords removed, and then calculated their
term frequencies within that paper. We computed a score for each
caption by summing the term frequencies of that caption’s words.
We then ranked all captions in the paper by these scores, giving
us the feature caption TF rank; thus, a higher rank is a proxy for
the caption’s importance to the document. We scaled this across
all captions in the paper for caption TF rank (scaled). Titles may
contain insight into the meaning of a paper, so we computed the
Jaccard distance between the words in the title and each caption.
Figure position features. Finally, we processed each document
to compute the order of figures. The figure position index is the number of the figure as encountered in the HTML version of the document. We also computed a scaled version, figure position (scaled),
based on the document’s total number of figures.
Figure 5b demonstrates the results of some of our striking image
prediction approaches with the PLOS ONE sample. As with Figure
5a, the x-axis shows the pHash distance and the y-axis is the corresponding 𝑀𝑅𝑅 or 𝑃@1 score. Randomly selecting the image from
a document performs at 𝑀𝑅𝑅 = 0.5185, 𝑃@1 = 0.2883 at a pHash
distance of 0. Merely choosing the last figure’s image achieves
𝑀𝑅𝑅 = 0.7753, 𝑃@1 = 0.6975 at a pHash distance of 0. Table 9
provides detailed numbers for results with using different classifierfeature combinations. Our best scoring classifier-feature combination at a pHash distance of 0 was Random Forest trained with base
features combined with figure position features at 𝑀𝑅𝑅 = 0.8643,
𝑃@1 = 0.7786. Applying the correlation information from Table 10
to remove features produced results with 𝑃@1 ≤ 0.7.

FUTURE WORK

For those items in the NEWSROOM dataset that still exist on the
web, it would be interesting to run our striking image prediction

analysis on the current versions of those articles. Even though the
articles are not current, their publishing platform has likely changed
and may now produce card metadata.
Our results for PLOS ONE may be specific to that journal, or they
may be specific to the biology and medical fields serviced by PMC.
Further striking image prediction analysis with different journals
is needed to expand and generalize these results. The open access
publisher Frontiers supplies striking images for its HTML articles
and may offer suitable comparison journals. Scholarly articles are
more commonly published as PDFs, so we will re-evaluate this
process with PDF extraction tools.
Additionally, another application of this research may be to
suggest which images should be included in the main sections of
a paper instead of being relegated to its supplemental sections or
appendices.

CONCLUSION

Social cards describe the content behind a URL, helping a user answer the question of “What does the underlying page contain?” A
social card summarizes each web page through the units of page
title, striking image, domain name, and description. While the title
and domain name are often easily extracted, automatically generating the description and a striking image are more challenging.
Social media platforms provide standards so that authors can insert
their own values for these social card units into their HTML pages
as metadata.
Per RQ1, our evaluation of the archived web pages (mementos)
of 277,724 news articles from the NEWSROOM dataset revealed
that card metadata fields are nonexistent for mementos captured
before 2010. This translates into roughly 150 billion web pages
at the Internet Archive for which social card creation tools will
need to automatically generate descriptions and striking images.
We found that news articles rapidly adopted social card metadata
fields, with 13.13% adoption in 2010 and reaching 93.05% by 2016.
We also evaluated 110,900 scholarly articles in the PMC open access dataset and discovered that while 77.86% of scholarly articles
specified a striking image, 73.98% reuse the same image among
multiple articles. In fact, 572/1109 (51.6%) of journals used the same
image in every article. Instead of selecting an image directly from
the article to summarize it, the publications chose a colorful placeholder, or a journal or publisher’s logo. This practice is not in line
with non-scholarly publishers, and thus scholarly articles are at a
disadvantage on social media.
This dearth of quality striking images inspired RQ2. By analyzing 37,522 articles from the NEWSROOM dataset and 198,523
articles from the journal PLOS ONE, we have determined that the
same automatic image selection approach cannot be applied to both
types of documents. With NEWSROOM, we achieve 𝑃@1 = 0.8314,
𝑀𝑅𝑅 = 0.8825 at a pHash distance of 0 with Random Forest and the
base features of image width, height, byte size, pixel size, negative
space, aspect ratio, and color count. In our PLOS ONE dataset experiment, applying these base features to Random Forest performed
worse than randomly selecting an image. We achieved the best
image selection performance of 𝑃@1 = 0.7786 and 𝑀𝑅𝑅 = 0.8643
at a pHash distance of 0 for PLOS ONE with Random Forest by
using the base features combined with the position of the figure

on the page. We did not achieve better results with features like
caption text or section references.
These results have implications for social media, news aggregation platforms, content management systems, and social media
storytelling. We believe that better social cards will help platforms
better summarize topics, equalize the probabilities that readers will
select more informative content, and, most important of all, help
readers understand the documents that others share with them.
