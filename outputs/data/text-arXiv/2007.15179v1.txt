Abstract
We are concerned with the issue of detecting changes and their signs from a data stream. For
example, when given time series of COVID-19 cases in a region, we may raise early warning signals of an epidemic by detecting signs of changes in the data. We propose a novel methodology
to address this issue. The key idea is to employ a new information-theoretic notion, which we call
the differential minimum description length change statistics (D-MDL), for measuring the scores
of change sign. We first give a fundamental theory for D-MDL. We then demonstrate its effectiveness using synthetic datasets. We apply it to detecting early warning signals of the COVID-19
epidemic using time series of the cases for individual countries. We empirically demonstrate that
D-MDL is able to raise early warning signals of events such as significant increase/decrease of
cases. Remarkably, for about 64% of the events of significant increase of cases in studied countries, our method can detect warning signals as early as nearly six days on average before the
events, buying considerably long time for making responses. We further relate the warning signals to the dynamics of the basic reproduction number R0 and the timing of social distancing.
The results show that our method is a promising approach to the epidemic analysis from a data
science viewpoint. The software for the experiments is available at https://github.com/

system is available at https://ibarakikenyukishi.github.io/d-mdl-html/index.

Introduction
Motivation

We address the issue of detecting changes and their signs in a data stream. For example, when given
time series of the number of COVID-19 cases in a country, we may expect to warn the beginning of an
epidemic by detecting changes and their signs.
Although change detection (see e.g. [1, 2, 3]) is a classical issue, it has remained open how the sign
of changes can be found. In principle the degree of change at a given time point has been evaluated
in terms of the discrepancy measure (e.g.. the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence) between probability
1

distributions of data before and after that time point (see e.g. [1, 4]). It is reasonable to think that the
differentials of the KL divergence may be related to signs of change. This is because the first differential
of the KL divergence is a velocity of change while its second differential is an acceleration of change.
The problem is here that in real cases, the KL-divergence and its differentials cannot be exactly
calculated since the true distribution is unknown in advance. A question lies in how we can estimate the
discrepancy measure and their differentials from data when the parameter values are unknown.
The purpose of this paper is to answer the above question from an information-theoretic viewpoint
based on the minimum description length (MDL) principle [5] (see also [6, 7] for its recent advances).
The MDL principle gives a strategy for evaluating the goodness of a probabilistic model in terms of
codelength required for encoding the data where a shorter codelength indicates a better model. We apply
this principle to change detection where a longer codelength indicates a more significant change. Along
this idea, we introduce the notion called the differential MDL change statistics (D-MDL) for the measure
of change signs. We theoretically and empirically justify this notion, and then apply it to the COVID-19
pandemic analysis using open datasets.

1.2

Related Work

There are plenty of work on change detection (see e.g. [1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11]). In many of them,
the degree of change has been related to the discrepancy measure for two distributions before and after a
time point, such as likelihood ratio, KL-divergence. However, there is no work on relating the differential
information such as the velocity of the change to change sign detection.
Most of previous studies in change detection are concerned with detecting abrupt changes [3]. In
the scenario of concept drift [12], the issues of detecting various types of changes, including incremental
changes and gradual changes, have been addressed. How to find signs of changes has been addressed
in the scenarios of volatility shift detection [13], gradual change detection [14] and clustering change
detection [15, 16, 17]. However, the notion of differential information has never been related to change
sign detection.
The MDL change statistics has been proposed as a test statistics in the hypothesis testing for change
detection [14, 18]. It is defined as the difference between the total codelength required for encoding
data for the non-change case and that for the change case at a specific time point t. A number of data
compression-based change statistics similar to it have also been proposed in data mining [19, 20, 21].
However, any differential variation of the compression-based change statistics has never been proposed.

Significance of This Paper

The significance of this paper is summarized as follows:
(1) Proposal of D-MDL and its use for change sign detection. We introduce a novel notion of DMDL as an approximation of KL-divergence of change and its differentials. We then propose practical
algorithms for on-line detection of change signs on the basis of D-MDL.
(2) Theoretical and empirical justification of D-MDL. We theoretically justify D-MDL in the hypothesis testing of change detection. We consider the hypothesis tests which are equivalent with D-MDL
scoring. We derive upper bounds on the error probabilities for these tests to show that they converge
2

exponentially to zero as sample size increases. The bounds on the error probabilities are used to determine a threshold for raising an alarm with D-MDL. We also empirically justify D-MDL using synthetic
datasets. We demonstrate that D-MDL outperforms existing change detection methods in terms of AUC
for detecting the starting point of a gradual change.
(3) Applications to COVID-19 pandemic analysis. On the basis of the theoretical and empirical
advantages of D-MDL, we apply it to the COVID-19 pandemic analysis. We are mainly concerned with
how early we are able to detect signs of outbreaks or the contraction of the epidemic for individual
countries. The results showed that for about 64% of outbreaks in studied countries, our method can
detect signs as early as about six days on average before the outbreaks. Considering the rapid spread,
six days can earn us considerably long time for making responses, e.g., implementing control measures
[22, 23, 24]. The earned time is especially precious in the presence of a considerably long period of the
incubation of the COVID-19 [25, 26, 27]. Moreover, we analyze relations between the change detection
results and social distancing events. One of findings is that for individual countries, an average of about
four changes/change signs detected before the implementation of social distancing correlates a significant
decline from the peak of daily new cases by the end of April.
The change analysis is a pure data science methodology, which detects changes only using statistical
models without using differential equations about the time evolution. Meanwhile, SIR (Susceptible
Infected Recovered) model [28] is a typical simulation method which predicts the time evolution of
infected population with physics model-based differential equations. Although the fitness of the SIR
model or its variants to COVID-19 data was argued in e.g. [29, 30], the complicated situation of COVID19 due to virus mutations, international interactions, highly variable responses from authorities, etc. does
not necessarily make any simulation model perfect. Therefore, the basic reproduction number R0 [31] (a
term in epidemiology, representing the average number of people who will contract a contagious disease
from one person with that disease) estimated from the SIR model may not be precise. We empirically
demonstrate that as a byproduct, the dynamics of R0 can be monitored by our methodology which only
requires the information of daily new cases. The data science approach then may form a complementary
relation with the simulation approach and gives new insights into epidemic analysis.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces D-MDL and gives a theory of
its use in the context of change sign detection. Section 3 gives empirical justification of D-MDL using
synthetic datasets. Section 4 gives applications of D-MDL to the COVID-19 pandemic analysis. Section
5 gives concluding remarks.

x ∈ X , let p(x; θ) = pθ (x) be the probability mass function specified by a parameter θ. Supposing that

θ changes over time. In the case when θ gradually changes over time, we define the signs of change as
the starting point of that change.
Let us consider the discrete time t. Let θt be the parameter value of θ at time t. Let D(p||q) denote
the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between two probability mass functions p and q:

When the parameter sequence {θt : t ∈ Z} is known, we can define the degree of changes at any given
time point. We can think of Φt as the degree of change of the parameter value itself at time t. We can
(1)
(2)
think of Φt , Φt as the velocity of change and the acceleration of change of the parameter at time t,
respectively. All of them quantify the signs of change. However, the parameter values are not known
in advance for general cases. The problem is how we can define the degree of changes when the true
distributions are unknown.

2.2

Differential MDL Change Statistics

In the case where the true parameter value is unknown, the MDL change statistics has been proposed to
measure the change degree in [14, 18] from a given data sequence. Below we denote xa , . . . , xb = xba .
In the case of a = 1, we may drop off a and write it as xb .
When the parameter θ is unknown, we may estimate it as θ̂ using the maximum likelihood estimation
method from a given sequence xn . I.e., θ̂ = argmax p(xn ; θ). Note that the maximum likelihood function
θ
P
maxθ p(xn ; θ̂) does not form a probability distribution of xn because xn p(xn ; θ̂) > 1. Thus we
construct a normalized maximum likelihood (NML) distribution [33] by
maxθ p(xn ; θ)
def
pNML (xn ) = P
n
y n maxθ p(y ; θ)
and consider the logarithmic loss for xn relative to this distribution by
def

LNML (xn ) = − log pNML (xn ),
which we call the NML codelength, where Cn is called the parametric complexity defined as

Cn =
max p(xn1 ; θ).

It is known in [32] that equation (1) is the optimal codelength that achieves the Shtarkov’s minimax
regret in the case where the parameter value is unknown. It is known in [33] that under some regularity
condition for the model class, Cn is asymptotically expanded as follows:

According to [14], the MDL change statistics at time point t is defined as follows:

The MDL change statistics is the difference between that the NML codelength of a given data sequence
for non-change and that for change at time t. It is a generalization of the likelihood ratio test [1, 34].

Hypothesis Testing for Change Detection
The 0th D-MDL test

We give rationale of D-MDL using the framework of hypothesis testing for change detection. First
suppose that a change point exists at t or not. Let us consider the following hypothesis testing framework:
The null hypothesis H0 is that there is no change point while the composite hypothesis H1 is that t is an
only change point.
(
H0 : xn1 ∼ p(X n ; θ0 ),
H1 : xt1 ∼ p(X t ; θ1 ), xnt+1 ∼ p(X n−t ; θ2 ).
where θ0 , θ1 , θ2 (θ1 6= θ2 ) are all unknown.
With the MDL principle, the test statistics is given as follows: For an accuracy parameter  > 0,
def 1
(0)
(9)
h0 (xn ; t, ) = {LNML (xn1 ) − (LNML (xt1 ) + LNML (xnt+1 ))} −  = Ψt − ,
n
(0)
where Ψt is the 0th D-MDL as in equation (4). H1 is accepted if h0 (xn ; t, ) > 0, otherwise H0 is
accepted. We call this test the 0th D-MDL test.
We define Type I error probability as the probability that the test accepts H1 although H0 is true
(false alarm rate) while Type II error probability as the one that the test accepts H0 although H1 is true
(overlooking rate). The following theorem justifies the use of the 0th D-MDL in change detection.
Theorem 2.1 [14] Type I and II error probabilities for the 0th D-MDL test are upper bounded as follows:

This theorem shows that Type I and II error probabilities in equation (10) and equation (11) converge to
zero exponentially in n as n increases for some appropriate . We see that the error exponents depend
on the parametric complexities of the model class as well as the Bhattacharyya distance in equation (12)
between the null and composite hypotheses. In this sense the 0th MDL test is effective in change point

detection.
2.3.2

The 1st D-MDL test

Next we give a hypothesis testing setting equivalent with the 1st D-MDL scoring. We consider the
situation where a change point exists at time either t or t + 1. Let us consider the following hypotheses:
The null hypothesis H0 is that the change point is t while the composite one H1 is that it is t + 1.
(
H0 : xt1 ∼ p(X t ; θ0 ), xnt+1 ∼ p(X n−t ; θ1 ),
H1 : xt+1
∼ p(X t+1 ; θ2 ), xnt+1 ∼ p(X n−t−1 ; θ3 ),
1
where θ0 , θ1 , θ2 , θ3 (θ0 6= θ1 , θ2 6= θ3 ) are all unknown.
We consider the following test statistics: For an accuracy parameter  > 0,

which compares the NML codelength for H0 with that for H1 . We accept H1 if h1 (x ; t, ) > 0, otherwise we accept H0 . We call this test the 1st D-MDL test. We easily see

is the 1st D-MDL. This implies that the 1st D-MDL test is equivalent with testing whether
the 1st D-MDL is larger than  or not. Thus the basic performance of discriminability of the 1st D-MDL
can be reduced to that of the 1st D-MDL test.
(0)
Let pt is the probability distribution at time t. Note that if t + 1 is the only change point, Ψt+1 ≈
(0)

D(pt+1 ||pt ) and if t is the only change point, Ψt ≈ D(pt ||pt−1 ). Hence this test is also equivalent with
comparison of the degree of change at time t + 1 and that at time t.
The following theorem shows the basic property of the 1st D-MDL test.

(The proof is in Sec. 1 of the supplementary information.)
This theorem shows that Type I and II error probabilities in equation (15) and equation (16) converge to
zero exponentially in n as n increases where the error exponents are related to the parametric complexities for the hypotheses as well as the Bhattacharyya distance between the null and composite hypotheses.
In this sense the 1st MDL test is effective. Type I error probability in equation (15) will be used for
determining a threshold of the alarm.

The 2nd D-MDL test

Next we consider a hypothesis testing setting equivalent with the 2nd D-MDL scoring. Suppose that
change points exists either at time t or at t − 1 and t + 1.
(
H0 : xt1 ∼ p(X t ; θ0 ), xnt+1 ∼ p(X n−t ; θ1 ),
H1 : x1t−1 ∼ p(X t−1 ; θ2 ), xt xt+1 ∼ p(X 2 ; θ3 ), xnt+2 ∼ p(X n−t−1 ; θ4 ).
where θ0 , θ1 , θ2 , θ3 , θ4 , (θ0 6= θ1 , θ2 6= θ3 6= θ4 ) are all unknown. H0 is the hypothesis that a change
happens at time t while H1 is the hypothesis that two changes happen at time t − 1 and t. In H0 , t is
a single change point while in H1 , t is a transition point between two close change points. Thus this
hypothesis testing evaluates whether time t is a change point or a transition point of close changes.
The test statistics is: For an accuracy parameter  > 0,

we have
(2)
Ψt ≈ 2h2 (xn ; t, ) + 2

This implies that the 2nd D-MDL test is equivalent with testing whether the 2nd D-MDL is larger than
2 or not. Thus the basic performance of discriminability of the 2nd D-MDL can be reduced to that of
the 2nd D-MDL test.
The following theorem shows the basic property of the 2nd D-MDL test.
Theorem 2.3 Type I and II error probabilities for the 2nd D-MDL test are upper bounded as follows:

This theorem can be proven similarly with Theorem 2.2. This theorem shows that Type I and II error
probabilities in equation (19) and equation (20) converge to zero exponentially in n as n increases where
the error exponents are related the sum of parametric complexities for the hypotheses as well as the
Bhattacharyya distance between the null and composite hypotheses. In this sense the 2nd D-MDL test is

effective. Type I probability in equation (19) will be used for determining the threshold in Sec.2.5.

Sequential Change Sign Detection with D-MDL

In previous sections, we considered how to measure the change sign scores at a specific time point t.
In order to detect change signs sequentially for the case where there exist multiple change points, we
can conduct sequential change sign detection using D-MDL in a similar manner with [14]. We give
two variants of the sequential algorithms. One is the sequential D-MDL algorithm with fixed windowing
while the other is that with adaptive windowing. In the former, we prepare a local window of fixed size
to calculate D-MDL at the center of the window. We then slide the window to obtain a sequence of
D-MDL change scores as with [14] (see also [35] for local windowing). We raise an alarm when the
score exceeds the predetermined threshold β. The algorithm is summarized as follows:
Sequential D-MDL algorithm with fixed windowing
Given: 2h: window size, T : data length, β: threshold parameter
for all t = h + 1, . . . , T − h + 1 do
Input xt−h , . . . , xt+h .
(α)
Calculate a change score Ψt = hα (xt+h
t−h , h, 0) (α = 0, 1, 2) at t by sliding the window.
(α)

Make an alarm if and only if Ψt
end for

> β.

Next we design the sequential D-MDL algorithm with adaptive windowing. In [36], the sequential
algorithm with adaptive windowing (SCAW2) was proposed by combining the 0th D-MDL with ADWIN
algorithm [9] (see also [37] for adaptive windowing) where the window grows until the MDL change
statistics exceeds a threshold. The threshold is determined so that the total number of detected change
points is finite. The sequential D-MDL algorithm can be obtained by replacing the 0th D-MDL with
general D-MDL in SCAW2. It outputs the size of window whenever a change point is detected.
Sequential D-MDL algorithm with adaptive windowing
Given: T : data length, {w }: threshold,
W ←∅
for all t = 1, . . . , T do
W ← W ∪ xt
(α)
|W |
if Ψt = hα (xstart , t, 0) > |W | /|W | (α = 0, 1, 2)
(α)

Drop the data earlier than argmax Ψt (W )

end if
Output |W |.
end for

t∈W

According to [36], the threshold w for Ψ(α) is set so that the total number of false alarms is finite.
This is set as follows: for some parameter δ > 0, when the parameter is d-dimensional,
w = (2 + d/2 + δ) log w + log(1/δ).

Hierarchical Sequential D-MDL Algorithm

Practically, we combine the algorithm with adaptive windowing for the 0th D-MDL and the algorithms
with fixed windowing for the 1st and 2nd D-MDL. We call this algorithm the hierarchical sequential DMDL algorithm. It is designed as follows. We first output not only a 0th D-MDL score but also a window
size with the 0th D-MDL with adaptive windowing and raise an alarm when the window shrinks, i.e.,
equation (21) is satisfied. We then output the 1st and 2nd D-MDL scores using the window produced by
the 0th D-MDL and raise alarms when the 1st or 2nd D-MDL exceeds the threshold so as to expect the
1st and 2nd D-MDL to detect change signs before the window shrinkage. Note that the window shrinks
only with the 0th D-MDL, but neither with the 1st nor 2nd D-MDL.

In this algorithm, the threshold w for the 1st D-MDL Ψt is determined so that Type I error
probability in equation (15) is less than the confidence parameter δ1 . That is, from equation (15) and
(1)
equation (3), letting w = w,
Type I prob, < exp(−(1)
w + log Ct Cn−t )
This yields

≤ exp(−(1)
w + (d/2) log(w/2) × 2) ≤ δ1 .
(1)
w ≥ d log(w/2) + log(1/δ1 ).

(22)

We employ the righthand side of equation (22) as the threshold of an alert of the 1st D-MDL.

(2)
The threshold w for the 2nd D-MDL Ψt can also be derived similarly with the 1st one. Note that
by equation (18), the threshold is 2 times the accuracy parameter for the hypothesis testing. Letting δ2
be the confidence parameter, we have
(2)
(23)
w ≥ 2(d log(w/2) + log(1/δ2 )).
We employ the righthand side of equation (23) as the threshold of an alert of the 2nd D-MDL. In practice,
δ1 and δ2 are estimated from data (see Sec. 4.2).

Result I: Experiments with Synthetic Data
Datasets

To evaluate how well D-MDL performs for abrupt/gradual change detection, we consider two cases;
multiple mean change detection and multiple variance one.
In the case of multiple mean change detection, we constructed datasets as follows: each datum was
independently drawn from the Gaussian distribution N (µt , 1) where the mean µt abruptly/gradually
changed over time according to the following rule: In the case of abrupt changes,
9
X
µt = 0.3
(10 − i)H(n − 1000i),
i=1

where H(x) is the Heaviside step function that takes 1 if x > 0 otherwise 0. In the case of gradual

10

changes, H is replaced with the following continuous function:


(x < 0),
0
S(x) = x/300 (0 ≤ x < 300),


1
(x ≥ 300).
In the case of multiple variance change detection, each datum was independently drawn from the
Gaussian distribution N (0, σt2 ) where the variance σt2 abruptly/gradually changed over time according
to the following rule: In the case of abrupt changes,
9
X
log σt = 0.1
(10 − i)H(n − 1000i).
i=1

In the case of gradual changes, H is replaced with S as with the multiple mean changes.
We define a sign of a gradual change as the starting point of that change. In all the datasets, change
points for abrupt changes and change signs for gradual changes were set at nine points: t = 1000, 2000,
. . . , 9000.

3.2

Evaluation Metric

For any change detection algorithm that outputs change scores for all time points, letting β be a threshold
parameter, we convert change-point scores {st } into binary alarms {at } as follows:
(
1 (st > β),
at =
0 (otherwise).
By varying β, we evaluate the change detection algorithms in terms of benefit and false alarm rate
defined as follows: Let T be a maximum tolerant delay of change detection. When the change truly starts
from t∗ , we define benefit of an alarm at time t as
(
∗|
(0 ≤ |t − t∗ | < T ),
1 − |t−t
∗
T
b(t; t ) =
0
(otherwise),

where t is a change point for abrupt change, while it is a sign for gradual change.

Methods for Comparison

In order to conduct the sequential D-MDL algorithm, we employed the univariate Gaussian distribution
whose probability density function is given by equation (7).
We employed three sequential change detection methods for comparison:
(1) Bayesian online change point detection (BOCPD) [11]: A retrospective Bayesian online change detection method. It originally calculates the posterior of run length. We modified it to compute a change
score by taking the expectation of the reciprocal of run length with respect to the posterior.
(2) ChangeFinder (CF) [4]: A state-of-the-art method of abrupt change detection.
(3) ADWIN2 [9]: A change detection method with adaptive windowing.
We conducted the sequential D-MDL algorithms with fixed window size in order to investigate their
most basic performance in terms of the AUC metric. The sequential D-MDL algorithm with adaptive
windowing outputs the window size rather than the D-MDL values themselves, hence in order to evaluate
the effectiveness of the magnitude of D-MDL, the sequential D-MDL with fixed windowing is a better
target for the comparison. All of CF, BOCPD, and ADWIN2 had some parameters, which we determined
from 5 sequences so that the AUC scores were made the largest.

3.4

Results

The performance comparison is summarized in Table 1. We see that both for the datasets, in the case
of abrupt changes, the 0th D-MDL performs best, while in the case of gradual changes, the 1st D-MDL
performs best and the 2nd D-MDL performs worse than the 1st but better than the 0th. That matches our
intuition. Because the 0th D-MDL was designed so that it could detect abrupt changes while the 1st one
was designed so that it could detect starting points of gradual changes.

Result II: Applications to COVID-19 Pandemic Analysis

Since the beginning of 2020, many countries have experienced the epidemic of COVID-19. And not
a few countries have enacted social distancing policies, e.g., stay-at-home order, closing non-essential
services, and limiting travel, to prevent the spread.
12

The purpose of our analysis is to demonstrate the importance of monitoring the dynamics of the
epidemic through detecting the occurrence of drastic outbreaks and their signs. We define outbreak as a
significant increase in the number of cases in a country.
We are mainly concerned with the following two problems:
1. How early are the outbreak signs detected prior to outbreaks?
2. How are the outbreaks/outbreak signs related to the social distancing events?
As a byproduct, the analysis of the dynamics of the basic reproduction number R0 [31] is conducted,
which can serve as supplementary information to the particular value estimated from the SIR model [38].

4.1

Data Source

We employed the data provided by European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) via
https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-todays-data-geographic-dis
We studied 37 countries with no less than 10,000 cumulative cases by Apr. 30 since some countries
started to ease the social distancing around the date. More details can be found in Sec. 2.1 of the
supplementary information.

4.2

Data Modeling

We studied two data models by considering the value of R0, which by definition is the product of transmissibility, the average contact rate between susceptible and infected individuals, and the duration of
infectiousness [38]. At the initial phase of an epidemic, R0 is larger than one [31]. And the cumulative
cases may grow exponentially [39, 40, 41, 42]. We thus employed the Malthusian growth model [43]
because it is widely used for characterizing the early phase of an epidemic [41, 42]. In particular, the
cumulative cases at time t, C(t), grows according to the following equation:
C(t) = C(0) exp(rt),
(24)
where C(0) is the number of cases at the start of an epidemic, and r is the growth rate. In the experiments,
we took the logarithm of C(t) to obtain the linear regression of the logarithm growth with respect to time
as follows:
log C(t) = rt + log C(0).
(25)
We modeled the residual error of the linear regression using the univariate Gaussian. When a change is
detected in the modeling of the residual error, we examine the increase/decrease in the coefficient of the
linear regression, i.e., r. We expect to detect changes in the parameter of the exponential modeling to
monitor the increase/decrease of R0 because R0 is proportional to r as derived from the SIR [40].
In later phases, the exponential growth pattern may not hold. For instance, when R0 < 1, daily
new cases would continue to decline and cease to exist [31]. Considering the complicated real scenarios,
epidemic models with certain assumptions on the growth rate or R0 may not fit an epidemic at a given
time. Therefore, we employed the univariate Gaussian distribution as in equation (7) to directly model
the number of daily new cases, without assuming any patterns of the growth. The change in the parameter
of the Gaussian modeling may reveal the relation between one and R0, i.e., R0 > 1 when daily new
cases increase significantly or R0 < 1 when daily new cases decrease significantly.

13

We conducted the hierarchical sequential D-MDL algorithm as in Sec. 2.6. The confidence parameter
δ for the 0th D-MDL as in equation (21) was set to be 0.05. Those for the 1st and 2nd D-MDL, i.e. δ1 , δ2
as in equation (22), equation (23) were determined as follows: we calculated the D-MDL scores around
the time when the initial warning was announced by an authority; we determined δ1 , δ2 so that the score
was the threshold. For example, the initial warning for Japan was set on Feb. 27, when the government
required closing elementary, junior high and high schools. If the resulting δ1 , δ2 was larger than 1, it was
set to be 0.99 because of the concept of confidence parameter.

4.3

Results for South Korea

We present two representative case studies (the results for all the studied countries are included in Sec.
2.2 of the supplementary information), South Korea and Japan (next subsection). The date of the implementation of social distancing was considered as Feb. 25 from which many non-essential services were
closed. We present results in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 for the Gaussian modeling and the exponential modeling,
respectively. Change scores were normalized into the range from 0 to 1.
With the Gaussian modeling, there were several alarms raised before the social distancing event. For
each alarm raised by the 0th D-MDL, the interpretation can be that a statistically significant increase of
cases occurs, with reference to the cases in Fig. 1(a). Hereafter, a change that is detected by the 0th
D-MDL and that corresponds to the increase of cases is regarded as an outbreak, which instantiates our
definition of outbreak. The outbreak detection is the classic change detection. We further relate it to R0.
Around the dates of the alarms, R0 > 1 was considered since we can confirm that the new infections
resulted from community transmission. Correspondingly, R0 was estimated at 1.5 by an epidemiological
study [44]. When the 0th D-MDL raised an alarm, the window size shrank to zero. Before that, both
the 1st and the 2nd D-MDL raised alarms, which are interpreted as the changes in the velocity and the
acceleration of the increase of cases, respectively. We can conclude that the 1st and the 2nd D-MDL were
able to detect the signs of the outbreak by examining the velocity and the acceleration of the spread. The
sign detection is the new concept with which we propose to supplement the classic change detection.
The 0th D-MDL raised several alarms after the event, and the latest ones corresponded to decreases
of cases. It is not difficult to tell that the corresponding R0 was less than one. We think that the social
distancing played a critical role in containing the spread because it can suppress R0 through reducing
the contact rate, which was supported by studies e.g. [44, 45, 46, 47]. Both the 1st and the 2nd D-MDL
again demonstrated the capability of early sign detection.
As for the exponential modeling, there was only one alarm raised by the 0th D-MDL and it was after
the social distancing event. Although the alarm was raised on Apr. 2, the date as the change point was
within the window as of Apr. 2, and was identified as Mar. 1. It turned out that the alarm corresponded to
a decrease in the coefficient of the linear regression. As we can see the cumulative cases in Fig. 2(a), the
sub-curve before Mar. 1 might have experienced an exponentially upward trend while the sub-curve after
that became almost flatten. We can conclude that R0 declined from a value larger than one to a value
considerably smaller than one on Mar. 1. The 1st D-MDL and the 2nd D-MDL did not raise alarms of
signs, which may be because R0 changed slowly as shown by only one alarm raised by the 0th D-MDL.

Results for Japan

The results are presented in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4. The policies of social distancing were enacted on Apr. 7.
With the Gaussian modeling, the observations were similar to those for South Korea before the event. But
after that, the 0th D-MDL raised no alarms, implying that R0 did not decrease to a value considerably
smaller than one. With respect to the exponential modeling, there were no alarms raised by the 0th
D-MDL, showing that there were no statistically significant changes in the value of R0.
As a comparison, the Gaussian modeling was effective and efficient at estimating the relation between
one and R0. The exponential modeling was able to monitor the change in the value of R0, but in a
relatively slower manner. The two models form a complementary relation on monitoring the dynamics
of R0. For instance, for Japan, the Gaussian modeling showed that the value of R0 reminded at a value
larger than one, and the exponential modeling showed that its value did not significantly change. In terms
of sign detection, the Gaussian modeling successfully detected signs while the exponential modeling did
not, which is because the Gaussian modeling deals with daily new cases whose growth pattern would
significantly change in the same direction (i.e., either increase or decrease) within a short period with
either R0 > 1 or R0 < 1 while the exponential modeling deals with cumulative cases whose growth
pattern only changes significantly when R0 changes significantly, and a significant change of R0 within
a short period did not happen in South Korea and Japan.

Summarization of Results on Individual Countries

This section presents two observations. The first is how early the signs can be detected prior to outbreaks
with the Gaussian modeling. For the countries studied, there were 106 outbreaks in total. The number of
outbreaks whose signs were detected by either the 1st or the 2nd D-MDL is 68, representing a detection
rate of 64%. For each outbreak whose signs were detected, we measured the time difference between the
earliest sign alarm and the outbreak alarm. The time difference in terms of the number of days is 6.25
(mean) ± 6.04 (standard deviation). Considering the fast spread, six days can buy us considerably long
time to prepare for an outbreak, and even to avoid a potential outbreak.
As a comparison, the 1st D-MDL detected signs for 65 outbreaks and the 2nd D-MDL detected signs
for 27 outbreaks. The smaller number for the 2nd D-MDL might be because the 1st D-MDL is better
at detecting starting points of gradual changes, and is consistent with results on the synthetic datasets as
in Table 1. The number of days before which the 1st D-MDL detected signs was 6.35 ± 5.91, and the
number for the 2nd D-MDL was 5.56 ± 6.50. Note that not all the outbreaks allowed for sign detection
since the 1st D-MDL sign detection requires one more data point and the 2nd one requires two more
data points in the window than the 0th D-MDL, respectively. The number of outbreaks allowing for a
1st D-DML sign is 88 while the number for a 2nd one is 81. Hence, it turns out that some outbreaks
occurred too quickly before signs can be detected.
Second, we observed that on average, countries responding faster in terms of a smaller number of
alarms before the social distancing event saw a quicker contraction of daily new cases. As of Apr. 30,
the curve of daily new infections in many countries had been flatten, and even started to be downward.
Therefore, alarms for declines in the number of cases from the global peak number were raised for ten
countries including Austria, China, Germany, Iran, Italy, Netherlands, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland,

and Turkey in alphabetical order. These countries are referred to as downward countries.
In total, the number of all kinds of alarms raised before the event for downward countries was 4.30
± 2.79 while it was 5.96 ± 4.22 for other countries. Separately, the number of alarms raised by the 0th,
the 1st, and the 2nd D-MDL for downward countries was 2.00 ± 1.55, 1.70 ± 1.42, and 0.60 ± 0.66,
respectively, while it was 1.85 ± 1.41, 3.08 ± 2.34, and 1.04 ± 1.53, respectively, for other countries.
Therefore, if the social distancing is a viable option, it is suggested that the action should better be taken
before it is late, e.g., later than four alarms. We further measured that it took an average of 30 days to
suppress the spread if prompt social distancing policies were enacted. By contrast, the average number of
days from the event to Apr. 30 is nearly 37 for non-downward countries, which is considerably more than
the time used for suppressing the spread in downward countries. Table 2 summarizes all the statistics,
and please refer to Sec. 2.3 of the supplementary information for more detailed numbers.

Conclusion

This paper has proposed a novel methodology for detecting signs of changes from a data stream. The key
idea is to use the differential MDL change statistics (D-MDL) as a sign score. This score can be thought
of as a natural extension of the differentials of the Kullback-Leibler divergence for measuring the degree
of changes to the case where the true mechanism for generating data is unknown. We have theoretically
justified D-MDL using the hypothesis testing framework and have empirically justified the sequential
D-MDL algorithm using the synthetic data. On the basis of the theory of D-MDL, we have applied it to
the COVID-19 pandemic analysis. We have observed that the 0th D-MDL found change points related to
outbreaks and that the 1st and 2nd D-MDL were able to detect their signs several days earlier than them.
We have further related the change points to the dynamics of the basic reproduction number R0. We have
20

also found that the countries with no more than five changes/change signs before the implementation of
social distancing tended to experience the decrease in the number of cases considerably earlier. This
analysis is a new promising approach to the pandemic analysis from the view of data science.
Future work includes studying how we can integrate the change analysis such as our methodology
with the conventional simulation studies such as SIR model. It is expected that our data science approach
has a complementary relation with the simulation approach and gives new insights into epidemiology.

Proof of Theorem 2.2

Let the maximum likelihood estimator of θi be θ̂i (i = 0, 1, 2, 3). Let us define the event as
h1 (xn1 ; t, ) = − log p(xt1 ; θ̂0 (xt1 )) − log p(xnt+1 ; θ̂1 (xnt+1 )) + log Ct + log Cn−t
Equivalently,

t+1

Type I error probability is evaluated as follows: Let the true parameter be θ0∗ and θ1∗ .

This implies

(p(xt1 ; θ̂0 (xt1 )/Ct )(p(xnt+2 ; θ̂1 (xnt+1 ))/Cn−t ).

Details of Experiments

Here, we give more details about the experiments on the change/change sign detection for all the countries studied.

2.1

Data Information

We employed the data provided by European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) via
https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-todays-data-geographic-dis
For information, there are 37 countries that had no less than 10,000 cases in total by Apr. 30, including
Austria, Belarus, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Ecuador, France, Germany, India, Indonesia,
Iran, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Pakistan, Peru, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, Roma2

nia, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine, United
Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States of America in alphabetic order.
We collected the date on which the social distancing was implemented from the information listed in
the IHME COVID-19 predictions via https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-kingdom.
If a certain country is not listed in the website, we referred to the Wikipedia page for the COVID-19
pandemic of the country, e.g., the COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea https://en.wikipedia.
org/wiki/COVID-19$_$pandemic$_$in$_$South$_$Korea. For information, the dates are
Austria: 2020-3-16, Belarus: 2020-4-9, Belgium: 2020-3-18, Brazil: 2020-3-24, Canada: 2020-3-17,
Chile: 2020-3-26, China: 2020-1-23, France: 2020-3-17, Germany: 2020-3-16, India: 2020-3-25, Indonesia: 2020-4-6, Iran: 2020-3-24, Ireland: 2020-3-12, Israel: 2020-3-15, Italy: 2020-3-9, Japan:
2020-4-7, Mexico: 2020-3-23, Netherlands: 2020-3-15, Pakistan: 2020-3-24, Peru: 2020-3-16, Poland:
2020-3-24, Portugal: 2020-3-19, Qatar: 2020-3-23, Romania: 2020-3-23, Russia: 2020-3-30, Saudi Arabia: 2020-3-24, Singapore: 2020-4-7, South Korea: 2020-2-25, Spain: 2020-3-13, Sweden: 2020-3-24,
Switzerland: 2020-3-16, Turkey: 2020-3-21, Ukraine: 2020-3-25, United Arab Emirates: 2020-3-31,
United Kingdom: 2020-3-24, United States of America: 2020-3-19. Ecuador was excluded from the
list above because the social distancing is introduced to be related to changes incurred by declines in
the number of cases and there was a very large number of cases in the initial phase of the epidemic in
Ecuador. The large number might be an outlier due to the data collection procedure, and would make
any changes after that date downward changes. But we still studied the change/change sign detection for
Ecuador.

2.2

Results for All the Studied Countries

This section presents the results for all the studied countries with both the Gaussian modeling and the
exponential modeling. Since the interpretation for each country is similar and there are many countries,
we omit the explanations. Please refer to the main content for the illustration of South Korea and Japan.
One point worthy mentioning is that with the exponential modeling, the 1st and the 2nd D-MDL raised
alarms for Pakistan (Fig. 40), Qatar (Fig. 48), Switzerland (Fig. 64), Turkey (Fig. 66), and United Arab
Emirates (Fig. 70), demonstrating the capability of sign detection.

Fig. 74: The results for the United States of America with exponential modeling. The date on which
the social distancing was implemented is marked by a solid line in black. a, the number of cumulative
cases. b, the change scores produced by the 0th M-DML where the line in blue denotes values of scores
and dashed lines in red mark alarms. c, the window sized for the sequential D-DML algorithm with
adaptive window where lines in red mark the shrinkage of windows. d, the change scores produced by
the 1st D-MDL. e, the change scores produced by the 2nd D-MDL.

Summarization of Results on Individual Countries

Fig. 75 shows the histogram of the number of days before which either the 1st D-MDL or the 2nd D-MDL
detected the first signs of outbreaks. Fig. 76 shows the histograms of the number of days before which
the 1st D-MDL and the 2nd D-MDL detected the first signs of outbreaks, respectively. Fig. 77 shows the
histograms of the numbers of alarms (all the 0th, the 1st and the 2nd) before the implementation of social
distancing for downward countries and non-downward ones, respectively. Fig. 78(a) shows the number
of days between the implementation of social distancing and the date of the first alarm raised by the 0th
D-MDL for the decline in the number of cases for downward countries. Fig. 78(b) shows the number of
days between the implementation of social distancing and Apr. 30 for non-downward countries.
