Abstract
Truncating the low-lying modes of the lattice Dirac operator results in an emergence of the chiralspin symmetry SU (2)CS and its flavor extension SU (2NF ) in hadrons. These are symmetries of the
quark - chromo-electric interaction and include chiral symmetries as subgroups. Hence the quark
- chromo-magnetic interaction, which breaks both symmetries, is located at least predominantly
in the near - zero modes. Using as a tool the expansion of propagators into eigenmodes of the
Dirac operator we here analytically study effects of a gap in the eigenmode spectrum on baryon
correlators. We find that both U (1)A and SU (2)L × SU (2)R emerge automatically if there is a
gap around zero. Emergence of larger SU (2)CS and SU (4) symmetries requires in addition a
microscopical dynamical input about the higher-lying modes and their symmetry structure.

INTRODUCTION

In a number of lattice spectroscopical studies with a chirally-invariant Dirac operator upon artificial truncation of the lowest modes of the Dirac operator [1, 2] a large
degeneracy was discovered in mesons [3–5] and baryons [6].

Corresponding symmetry

groups, SU (2)CS and SU (2NF ) [7, 8], turned out to be larger than the chiral symmetry SU (NF )L × SU (NF )R × U (1)A of the QCD Lagrangian. The chiral-spin symmetry
group SU (2)CS has U (1)A as a subgroup while its flavor extension SU (2NF ) contains both
SU (NF )L × SU (NF )R × U (1)A and SU (2)CS as subgroups. The chiral-spin transformations
from SU (2)CS includes rotations that mix the left- and right-handed components of the
quark field. Obviously these symmetries are not symmetries of a free Dirac equation or
of the QCD Lagrangian. However, they are symmetries of the Lorentz-invariant fermion
charge operator and (in a given reference frame) of the quark - chromo-electric interaction
while the interaction of quarks with the chromo-magnetic field and the quark kinetic term
break them. Consequently the emergence of SU (2)CS and SU (2NF ) upon truncation of
the low-lying modes tells that while the confining quark - electric interaction is distributed
among all modes of the Dirac operator, the quark - magnetic interaction is located at least
predominantly in the near - zero modes. Some unknown microscopic dynamics should be
responsible for this phenomenon.
These symmetries emerge naturally, i.e. without any explicit truncation, in hot QCD
above the pseudocritical temperature [9–11], where the near-zero modes of the Dirac operator
are suppressed by temperature [17]. Consequently elementary objects in that range are not
free quarks and gluons but rather chirally symmetric quarks bound by the chromo-electric
field into color singlet objects, like a ”string”.
According to the Banks-Casher relation [12] the chiral symmetry breaking quark condensate is proportional to the density of the near-zero modes. A gap in the low lying
Dirac eigenmode spectrum induces restoration of SU (NF )L × SU (NF )R symmetry. It was
shown that it also induces restoration of U (1)A in the J = 0 mesons [13]. Analytical study
of the J = 0 and J = 1 isovector meson propagators in terms of the eigenmodes of the
Dirac operator revealed that all meson correlators that are connected by the U (1)A and/or
SU (2)L ×SU (2)R transformations get necessarily degenerate if such a gap exists in the Dirac
spectrum [14]. However, a possible emergence of SU (2)CS and of SU (2NF ) requires further
2

dynamical properties encoded in certain matrix elements. Here we extend this analysis to
baryons and show that the same conclusions remain valid in this case as well.

γi γj + γj γi = 2δij ;

γ5 = γ1 γ2 γ3 γ4 .

Different k define four-dimensional representations that can be reduced into two-dimensional
irreducible ones. The su(2) algebra

is satisfied for any k in Eq. (2).
U (1)A is a subgroup of SU (2)CS . The SU (2)CS transformations mix the left- and righthanded fermions and different representations of the Lorentz group. The free massless quark
Lagrangian and Dirac equation do not have this symmetry.
Extending the direct product SU (2)CS × SU (NF ) one obtains an SU (2NF ) group. The
chiral symmetry group of QCD SU (NF )L × SU (NF )R × U (1)A is a subgroup of SU (2NF ).

The SU (2)CS and SU (2NF ) groups are not symmetries of the QCD Lagrangian as a whole.
In a given reference frame the quark-gluon interaction Lagrangian in Minkowski space
can be splitted into temporal and spatial parts:

with the electric part of the gluonic gauge field. It is invariant under any unitary transformation acting in the Dirac and/or flavor spaces. In particular it is a singlet under SU (2)CS
and SU (2NF ) groups. The spatial part consists of a quark kinetic term and interaction
with the magnetic part of the gauge field. It breaks SU (2)CS and SU (2NF ). We conclude
that interaction of electric and magnetic components of the gauge field with fermions can
be distinguished by symmetry.
In order to discuss the notions ”electric” and ”magnetic” one needs to fix the reference
frame. An invariant mass of the hadron is the rest frame energy. Consequently, to discuss
physics of hadron mass generation it is natural to use the hadron rest frame.
In refs. [3–5] and [6] meson and baryon masses have been extracted from the asymptotic
slope of the rest frame t-direction Euclidean correlator

where OΓ (x, y, z, t) is an operator that creates a quark-antiquark pair for mesons or three
quarks for baryons with fixed quantum numbers. Truncation of the near-zero modes of the
Dirac operator resulted in emergence of the SU (2)CS and SU (2NF ) symmetries in hadrons.
4

This implies that a confining SU (2)CS - and SU (2NF )-symmetric quark-electric interaction is distributed among all modes of the Dirac operator. At the same time the quarkmagnetic interaction, that breaks both symmetries, is located only in the low-lying modes.
Consequently truncating the low-lying modes results in emergence of symmetries in the
spectrum of hadrons.

CHIRAL AND CHIRAL-SPIN TRANSFORMATIONS OF NUCLEON OPER-

ATORS

In Ref. [6] the emergence of the SU (2)CS symmetry in nucleons upon truncation of the
lowest-lying modes of the Dirac operator was studied on the lattice. In particular it was
demonstrated that correlators along the time direction calculated with different nucleon
operators that are not connected by chiral U (1)A and/or SU (2)L × SU (2)R transformations
but connected by the chiral-spin transformation (1)-(2) with k = 4 get degenerate. As
discussed in the introduction our main objective here is to analyse which conditions would
be sufficient for emergence of chiral and chiral-spin symmetries in nucleons upon the lowmode truncation (or suppression). To this end we first classify the nucleon operators with
respect to chiral and chiral-spin transformations. Such a classification of nucleon operators
(with spin zero diquark) for U (1)A , SU (2)L × SU (2)R and SU (2)CS , k = 4 transformations
is discussed below.
A complete set of nucleon operators (J = 1/2, I = 1/2, P = ±1) with spin-zero diquarks
consists of four operators [16] of the following form:
(i)

(i)

(i)

(i)

N± = abc P± Γ1 ua {dTb Γ2 uc − uTb Γ2 dc },
(i)

(12)
(i)

where P± = 21 (1 ± γ4 ) is the parity projector. The matrices Γ1 and Γ2 are given in Table
(i)

(i)

I. In our case the diquark {dTb Γ2 uc − uTb Γ2 dc } has spin 0 and isospin I = 0.

It is known that only two local nucleon operators are linearly independent if one takes into
account requirements of Lorentz- and Fierz-invariance [15]. However, the chiral-spin symmetry is not a symmetry of the Dirac equation and the chiral-spin transformations mix different
irreducible representations of the Lorentz group. Consequently if one discusses properties of
operators under the chiral-spin transformations one needs a complete set of such operators
with respect to SU (2)CS . Since a single-quark field transforms under a two-dimensional

irreducible representation (1)-(2) of SU (2)CS , k = 4 a complete set of three-quark nucleon
interpolators with respect to SU (2)CS should contain eight independent operators of positive
and negative parity because 2 ⊗ 2 ⊗ 2 = 21 ⊕ 22 ⊕ 4. Such operators with J = 0 diquark
are listed in Table I.
Applying the U (1)A transformation on the given operator of Table I, one obtains a linear
combination of some operators that are connected by blue arrows in Fig. 1. Consequently
the operators connected by blue arrows form reducible representations of U (1)A . The irreducible representations of U (1)A are one-dimensional and can be obtained as certain linear
combinations of operators connected by blue arrows.
The axial part of SU (2)L ×SU (2)R (abbreviated as SU (2)A ) transforms the given operator
into a linear superposition of operators connected by dashed red lines on Fig. 1. For example,

both the operators of positive and negative parity N (1) 12 , 12

For the operators N (3) 21 , 12

the situation is a bit more complicated. Applying the SU (2)L × SU (2)R transformation on each of these operators one
obtains linear combinations of these operators as well as of ∆-operators (isospin I = 3/2) of

and N (4) 12 , 12

The SU (2)CS , k = 4 transformations connect all operators inside the green boxes of Fig.
1. Finally the SU (4) transformations connect all eight operators of Fig. 1 along with the
respective ∆-partners.

SPECTRAL DECOMPOSITION

In this section we analyse the Euclidean nucleon propagators along t-direction upon
truncation of the low-lying modes of the Dirac operator. We follow the procedure that was
developed in Ref. [14] for a similar study of meson propagators. This approach is based on
the spectral decomposition of the quark propagator in terms of the eigenmodes of the Dirac
operator. The eigenmodes contain complete information about interaction of a quark with
a gluonic field.
We work in Euclidean space-time and consider a hermitian massless Dirac operator D0 ≡
iγµ Dµ . The eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the Dirac operator are defined by the relation
D0 ψ (n) = ηn ψ (n) .

Because of {γ5 , D0 } = 0, the eigenvalues come in pairs with opposite signs (ηn , −ηn ) since
D0 γ5 ψ (n) = −ηn γ5 ψ (n) .

(16)

In the following we will use the notation: η−n ≡ −ηn . Here and in the rest of this work
we assume that the Dirac operator D0 does not have exact zero modes in its spectrum,
which is equivalent to selecting gauge configurations with zero global topological charge.
The contribution of exact zero modes to observables vanishes in the thermodynamic limit.
Therefore in Eqs. (15) and (16), ηn 6= 0, for all ψ (n) .
The full Dirac operator for a quark field with mass m can be decomposed as

Now we consider baryon propagators and their decomposition using (17) for a theory
with two mass degenerate quark flavours. A general baryon interpolator, see Eq. (14), can

The functions S ggg (x, y),S ggh (x, y), S ghh (x, y) and S hhh (x, y) contain the information about
the eigenfunctions of the Dirac operator and the structure of the baryon field under consideration.
Therefore the correlator C(x, y) has terms proportional to the g(m, η) function, like
gn gk gl S ggg (x, y), gn gk hl S ggh (x, y) and gn hk hl S ghh (x, y), that we call g-terms, and terms proportional only to the h(m, η) function, that we call h-terms. A sketch of these two functions
for different mass values is shown in Fig. 3.
In the chiral limit m → 0 the function g(m, η) approaches the delta-function π2 δ(η). Hence
a gap around zero in the spectrum of the Dirac operator will induce vanishing of the terms
in Eq. (25) that contain at least one factor of g. In other words, all g-terms in Eq. (25)
vanish in the chiral limit upon truncation of the near-zero modes of the Dirac operator.
The h(m, η) function is peaked at η = m and falls slower compared to the g(m, η)
function at high eigenvalues η. Consequently while the h(m, η) function still suppresses
higher eigenvalues η, making a small hole in the Dirac eigenspectrum will not necessarily
lead to the vanishing of the h-term in Eq. (25) in the chiral limit unless some additional
suppressing dynamical factors are contained in S hhh (x, y).

In Fig. 4 we show how the difference of two correlators (25) calculated with any two

4 that all nucleons connected by U (1)A and/or SU (2)A transformations, see Fig. 1, are gequivalent, see for details Appendices B and C. Consequently a gap in the low-lying spectrum
of the Dirac operator results (in the chiral limit) in degeneracy of all correlators obtained with
operators connected by dashed red and/or blue arrows in Fig. 1. We conclude that a gap
12

in the Dirac spectrum implies necessarily restoration of both U (1)A and SU (2)L × SU (2)R
symmetries in nucleons. It is similar to the results for meson correlators obtained in [14].
Such degeneracies of the nucleon correlators have been observed on the lattice in Ref. [6].
Let us summarise. Restoration of U (1)A and SU (2)L × SU (2)R symmetries in nucleon
correlators (24) is necessarily provided by a gap in spectrum of the Dirac operator, i.e. all
U (1)A and SU (2)L × SU (2)R breaking dynamics is contained only in the near-zero modes.
However, the observations of Ref. [6] went essentially further than simply U (1)A and
SU (2)L × SU (2)R restoration. It was noticed that a larger symmetries SU (2)CS and SU (4)
emerge in baryon masses upon low-modes truncation.
From the analytical side we can now conclude the following. Comparing Fig. 4 with
Fig.1 we observe that, given a gap in the Dirac spectrum, emergence of SU (2)CS and SU (4)
requires in addition that the h-term in the difference of two correlators connected by the
SU (2)CS transformation (and not connected by the chiral transformations) should be at
least strongly suppressed for higher-lying eigenmodes of the Dirac operator. While some
suppression is indeed provided by the hhh factor, see Fig. 3, this suppression is not as
strong as in g-terms. In other words, a gap in the Dirac spectrum does not automatically
imply emergence of the SU (2)CS and SU (4) symmetries in correlators (25).
This result is not unexpected. In contrast to the chiral symmetries the SU (2)CS and
SU (4) symmetries are not covariant. They are symmetries of the quark-electric interaction
in the given reference frame, while the quark kinetic term as well as the quark-magnetic
interaction break them. They have been observed as symmetries of hadron masses upon lowmode truncation, i.e. symmetries of the rest frame correlation functions. The correlators (24)
mix different reference frames in Minkowski space and only covariant symmetries, such as
chiral symmetries, should persist in these correlators. Consequently to address the question
of symmetries of hadron masses we need now to analyze the rest frame correlators (11). This
means we need to study the correlators

C± (t) =

x,y,z

where the sum

P

x,y,z

(i)

(i)

hN± (x, y, z, t)N̄± (0, 0)i,

(26)

is over the all space.

However summation over all spatial points x, y, z does not convert an h-connection between the N (2) and N (3) operators in Fig. 4 into a g-connection. We do not get further
g-equivalence as compared the ones indicated in Fig. 4. The presence of a gap in the Dirac
13

spectrum does not automatically imply emergence of SU (2)CS and SU (4).
In full QCD studies with the explicite removal of the low lying modes in the propagators the SU (2)CS and SU (4) symmetries were observed in the hadron spectrum [6] . This
implies that a cancellation of hhh-terms occurs due to some additional SU (2)CS and SU (4)symmetric microscopic dynamics, i.e., QCD dynamics beyond the chiral symmetry breaking
dynamics dominated by the low modes. Such dynamics, as it follows from the symmetry
classification of the QCD Lagrangian in Sec. II, should be related with the confining quark
- chromo-electric interaction.
Let us summarise. Restoration of U (1)A and SU (2)L × SU (2)R symmetries in nucleon
correlators (24) is necessarily provided by a gap in spectrum of the Dirac operator, i.e. all
U (1)A and SU (2)L × SU (2)R breaking dynamics is contained only in the near-zero modes.
The SU (2)CS and SU (4) symmetries in the rest-frame correlators (26) do not automatically
emerge. Their emergence requires some additional microscopical dynamical input that would
guarantee that contributions of the high-lying modes is SU (2)CS and SU (4) symmetric.

B.

Br (χz ) baryon propagators

In Fig. 2 we have reported irreducible SU (2)CS representations of the baryon operators
defined in Eq. (14). Each of these operators is a U (1)A -singlet, i.e. transforms into itself
upon the U (1)A transformation. This is because by definition the Br (χz ) interpolators are
eigenstates of γ5 in the different representations 21 , 22 and 4 of SU (2)CS .
Regarding the SU (2)L × SU (2)R , each operator from Fig. 2 is a linear combination of
positive and negative parity operators (12). Different operators (12) belong to different
irreducible representations of the parity-chiral group, as was discussed above, so no definite
representation of SU (2)L × SU (2)R can be ascribed to the operators (14).
Now we apply a spectral decomposition of Sec. IV to the propagators built with the
baryon operators (14)
C(x, y)r,χz = hBr (χz )(x)B̄r (χz )(y)i.

(27)

We find that the difference between two generic propagators C(x, y)r,χz and C(x, y)r0 ,χ0z ,
always contains hhh-terms. This means that a gap in the spectrum of the Dirac operator
does not yet automatically imply emergence of the SU (2)CS and SU (4) symmetries. This
result is not unexpected since the correlators C(x, y)r,χz mix different reference frames in
14

Minkowski space-time and only covariant symmetries can persist in such correlators. It is
in complete agreement with the result obtained for the nucleon propagators, see Fig. 4.
Consequently we analyze now baryon correlators in the rest frame, i.e. we consider the
correlators
C(t)r,χz =

X
x,y,z

where the sum

P

x,y,z

hBr (χz )(x, y, z, t)B̄r (χz )(0, 0)i,

(28)

is over the all space.

Under parity transformations the quark fields transform as
P

P
qxaα −
→ qxaα
= (γ4 )αβ qPxaβ

(29)

where Px ≡ Pµν xν and Pµν = diag(−1, −1, −1, 1) is the parity operator, hence if xµ =
(x, y, z, t), then (Px)µ = (−x, −y, −z, t). q is a generic quark field. Applying the parity
transformations (29) to the baryon operators in (14) we get the following relation for generic
representation r and chiralspin projection χz
Br (χz )(Px) = ηBrP (−χz )(x),

(30)

where we indicate Br (χz )(Px) = Br (χz )(−x, −y, −z, t) and BrP (χz ) is the baryon operator
Br (χz ) in (14), and we have substitued u → uP and d → dP , see (29). In Eq. (30) η = ±1,

depending on r and χz , and we used that γ4 C = −Cγ4 and that γ4 γ± γ4 = γ∓ . Plugging Eq.
(30) in (28) we get
C(t)r,χz =

X
x,y,z

=

X

=

hBr (χz )(x, y, z, t)B̄r (χz )(0, 0)i
hBr (χz )(−x, −y, −z, t)B̄r (χz )(0, 0)i
hBrP (−χz )(x, y, z, t)B̄rP (−χz )(0, 0)i

(31)

hBr (−χz )(x, y, z, t)B̄r (−χz )(0, 0)i = C(t)r,−χz ,

where in the third line we used Eq. (30). Since we are averaging over all possible quark
fields we can remove the label P in the last line of Eq. (31) (because parity is a symmetry
of the QCD action and the measure in the average h·i is parity-invariant).
Eq. (31) tells us that for a given irreducible representation r of SU (2)CS we have C(t)r,χz −
C(t)r,−χz = 0, for all χz . Hence in the rest frame the correlators for the baryons within the
15

doublet 21 and 22 representations are equal. This is a general statement, irrespective whether
there is or there is not a gap in the spectrum of the Dirac operator. This fact does not mean,
however, that the SU (2)CS symmetry is manifest in the rest-frame correlators, because in
the representation 4 the correlators with χz = ±1/2 are not equal to the correlators with
χz = ±3/2.
A presence of a gap in the Dirac spectrum does not automatically make the correlators
with χz = ±1/2 and with χz = ±3/2 g-equivalent. The emergence of SU (2)CS requires some
additional suppression of matrix elements with higher-lying modes as was discussed in the
previous subsection.

VI.

CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we have analysed analytically, by expansion of the propagators into eigenmodes of the Dirac operator, which symmetries emerge in baryon correlators (masses) if
there is a gap around zero in the spectrum of the Dirac operator. We have found that such
a gap results necessarily in emergence of chiral U (1)A and SU (2)L × SU (2)R symmetries in
baryons.
Some specific dynamics in QCD leads to the accumulation of the near-zero modes, i.e. to
the breaking of chiral symmetries. Given the γ 5 -anticommutativety of the Euclidean Dirac
operator we prove here that a gap in the Dirac eigenmode spectrum implies necessarily
restoration of both U (1)A and SU (2)L × SU (2)R symmetries. The root of this statement is
precisely the same as of Banks-Casher relation. We do not need to know which dynamics
and why it leads to the accumulation of the near-zero modes.
Emergence of larger SU (2)CS and SU (4) symmetries, that was observed on the lattice
upon truncation of the near-zero modes of the Dirac operator and also at high temperatures
without any truncation, requires that the electric interaction should be the most important
for higher-lying modes. This is burried in the eigenfunctions of the Dirac operator and
cannot be specified within the present approach which does not use any dynamical input.
