Abstract
Large-time behavior of solutions to the compressible Navier-Stokes equations for viscous
and heat-conductive gases in R3 is examined. Under a suitable condition involving only
the low frequencies of the initial data, optimal time decay rates for the non-isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes flows are obtained, by developing some energy arguments given
by [Xin and Xu, arXiv:1812.11714v2].

κ > 0 denotes the heat conductivity coefficient. For a general fluid, P is a function of ρ
and θ. Here, we only consider the case of perfect heat conducting and viscous gases, i.e.,
P(ρ, θ ) = Aρθ for some constant A > 0. Without loss of generality, we assume that A = 1
throughout the paper.
If the effect of the temperature is neglected and thus the pressure is a function of ρ,
Eq. (1.1) reduces to the isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations, which have been
widely studied (see [3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 40] and the references therein).
However, the system (1.1), involving the heat conducting effect, is much more complicated
due to the occurrence of stronger nonlinearity, and thus has attracted increasing attention
from mathematicians. Significant progress has been made in the understanding of the existence, regularity and asymptotic behavior of the solutions over the past several decades.
In the absence of vacuum, the initial density ρ0 is bounded away from zero. Nash [34]
obtained the local existence of classical solutions in Sobolev spaces. Itaya [26] showed the
existence of the local classical solutions in Hölder spaces, and this result was further derived
by Tani [36] in a domain with boundary. Later on, Matsumura and Nishida [32] proved
the existence of global small solutions and stability of a basic steady-state solution ( see
also [29] for the one-dimensional situation). For the existence and asymptotic behavior
of weak solutions, Jiang [27] considered the one-dimensional case, Jiang [28] examined a
spherically symmetric structure in two- and three-dimensional spaces, Hoff and Jenssen
[21] discussed spherically and cylindrically symmetric structures in the three-dimensional
space, and Feireisl [18] investigated the problem in two- and three-dimensional bounded
domains.
In the presence of vacuum, long-time solutions may not exist. If κ = 0, it is obtained by
Xin [38] that any non-zero smooth solution with initial compactly supported density would
blow up in a finite time. Feireisl [17] got the existence of variational solutions in R d (d ≥ 2)
under the condition that the temperature equation is satisfied only as an inequality in the
sense of distributions. For the equality equations in the sense of distributions, Bresch and
Desjardins [2] proposed some different assumptions from [17] and obtained the existence of

2

global weak solutions to the compressible Navier-Stokes equations with large initial data in
T 3 and R3 . Huang and Li [23] established the global existence and uniqueness of classical
solutions to the three-dimensional compressible Navier-Stokes system with smooth initial
data, which are of small energy but possibly large oscillations, and with initial density allowed to vanish. Wen and Zhu [37] established the global existence of spherically and cylindrically symmetric classical solutions to the three-dimensional compressible Navier-Stokes
equations. We also emphasis some blowup criterions given by Huang and Li [22, 23, 24]
and Huang et al. [25] (see also the references therein). The readers may refer to Chen et al.
[5] and Wen and Zhu [37] for more recent developments on this subject.
Let us recall the critical regularity framework of (1.1). Rigorously speaking, Eq. (1.1)
does not possess any scaling invariance with respect to (u, ρ, θ, P). However, in the absence
of the pressure, we define the scaling transformation:
ρ(t, x ) → ρ(λ2 t, λx ),

u(t, x ) → λu(λ2 t, λx ),

θ (t, x ) → λ2 θ (λ2 t, λx )

λ > 0.

(1.2)

A function space is said to be critical with respect to (1.1) if the space norm is invariant

p

with respect to the scaling transformation (1.2). For example, the product space Ḃ p,1 (R d ) ×
d
p −1

d
p −2

Ḃ p,1 (R d ) × Ḃ p,1 (R d ), 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞, is a critical space for the system (1.1).
In the framework of critical spaces, a breakthrough was made by Danchin [11] for the
isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations, where he proved the local wellposedness
with large initial data and global solutions with small initial data. This result was further
extended by Charve et al. [3], Chen et al. [5], Haspot [20] and the authors [8]. For the
non-isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations (1.1), Chikami and Danchin [9] and
Danchin [12] considered the local wellposedness problem. Global small solutions in a critical L p Besov framework were obtained respectively by Danchin [13] for p = 2 and Danchin
and He [14] for more general p. It should be mentioned that the critical Besov space used in
[9] and [14] seems the largest one in which the system (1.1) is well-posed. Indeed, Chen et

al. [7] proved the ill-posedness of (1.1) in Ḃ p,1 × Ḃ p,1 × Ḃ p,1 (R3 ) for p > 3.
In the present paper, we consider the large time behaviour of three-dimensional global
solutions to (1.1), stemmed from the pioneering work of Matsumura and Nishida [32] on

(1.3)

when the initial data are perturbed around the equilibrium state (ρ̄, 0, ϑ̄). Similar decay
estimates have been established in the half-space or exterior domains (see, for example,
[30, 31, 33]). Subsequently, the L2 decay estimate (1.3) was improved by Ponce [35] to the
L p one at the rate O(hti

− d2 (1− 1p )

) with 2 ≤ p ≤ ∞ and d = 2, 3. Inspired by a series of work

[15, 16, 32, 39, 40], the present study aims at showing optimal time-decay estimates for (1.1)
within the critical regularity framework of the solutions constructed in [14].
Let (ρ̄, ū = 0, θ̄ ) be an equilibrium state with constants ρ̄ > 0 and θ̄ > 0. We look for the
solutions of (1.1) such that

(ρ( x, t), u( x, t), θ ( x, t)) → (ρ̄, 0, θ̄ ) for | x | → ∞, t > 0.
For convenience, let ρ̄ = θ̄ = 1 and define

Au = µ∆u + (λ + µ)∇div u,

ρ = 1 + a,

θ = 1 + ϑ,

I ( a) =

a

J (a) = ln(1 + a).

Then, we can rewrite (1.1) into the following system:

The present paper can be regarded as a further study on the previous theorem without
the additional smallness assumption (1.10). For the compressible Navier-Stokes equations
without (1.10) (let ϑ0 = 0), the optimal time decay has been obtained by Xin and Xu [39].
Now we enlarge the range of σ in (1.11) and remove (1.10) for the compressible NavierStokes equations involving heat-conductive gases. Compared to the compressible NavierStokes equations discussed in [39], the equations (1.4) contain the stronger nonlinear terms
I (a)∆ϑ and I (a)| D (u)|2 , which lead to analysis difficulties.
The main result of the present paper reads as follows.

hold true for a positive constant C and the positive differential operator Λs = F −1 | ξ | s F with F
the Fourier transformation.
Remark 1.4. Compared with Theorem 1.2 on the decay rates, Theorem 1.3 does not need the smallness assumption (1.10). Moreover, the σ range is larger than that in (1.11) and thus more decay
properties can be derived.
2. Preliminaries
For convenience, we use the symbols k(a, b)k X = k ak X + kbk X and F . G, which represents the inequality F ≤ CG for a generic constant C.
In this section, we recall some basic facts on Littlewood-Paley theory (see [1] for instance). Let χ ≥ 0 and ϕ ≥ 0 be two smooth radial functions so that the support of χ
is contained in the ball {ξ ∈ R3 : |ξ | ≤

{ξ ∈ R 3 :

the support of ϕ is contained in the annulus

∀ξ 6= 0.

Let F be the Fourier transform. The homogeneous dyadic blocks ∆˙ j and the low-frequency
cutoff operators Ṡ j are defined for all j ∈ Z by
∆˙ j u = F −1 ( ϕ(2− j ·)F u),

Ṡ j u = F −1 (χ(2− j ·)F u).

Let us remark that, for any homogeneous function A of order 0 smooth outside 0, we have

k∆˙ j ( A( D ) f )k L p ≤ Ck∆˙ j f k L p .

∀ p ∈ [1, ∞],

Denote by Sh (R3 ) the space of tempered distributions subject to the condition

Then we have the decomposition

∀ u ∈ Sh ( R 3 ) .

We recall the definition of homogeneous Besov spaces.

3. The proof of Theorem 1.3
The proof is to show the decay estimate of the solution (a, u, ϑ) given in Theorem 1.1.
This decay estimate is simply derived from a Lyapunov-type differential inequality for the
solution. This inequality lies on the viability of the uniform bound

This bound can be derived from an energy estimate of (1.4). To show the energy estimate,
we starts with the following energy estimate the linearized equation system of (1.4).

condition σ > 0 cannot be guaranteed. Thus in order to make use of Proposition 2.7 or (2.1),
we employ the formulation I (a) = a − aI (a) and argue in the same way as the derivation

I (a)∆ϑh = Ṫ∆ϑ h I (a) + Ṙ(∆ϑh , I (a)) + ṪI (a) ∆ϑh

(3.32)

and Lemmas 2.3 and 2.5 to estimate the first two items of right-hand side of the previous
