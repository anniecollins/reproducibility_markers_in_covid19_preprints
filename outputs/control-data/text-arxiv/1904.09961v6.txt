Abstract
We investigate a particular type of classical nonsingular bouncing cosmology, which results from
general relativity if we allow for degenerate metrics. The simplest model has a matter content
with a constant equation-of-state parameter and we get the modified Hubble diagrams for both
the luminosity distance and the angular diameter distance. Based on these results, we present a
Gedankenexperiment to determine the length scale of the spacetime defect which has replaced the
big bang singularity. A possibly more realistic model has an equation-of-state parameter which is
different before and after the bounce. This last model also provides an upper bound on the defect
length scale.

INTRODUCTION

There have been discussions from various physics perspectives of the possible existence
of a pre-big-bang phase, with or without a bounce-type behavior of the cosmic scale factor.
See, e.g., Refs. [1–3] and references therein.
Recently, we have obtained a surprising hint for the actual existence of a pre-big-bang
phase [4], where we worked with the established theory of general relativity in four spacetime
dimensions but allowed for degenerate metrics. (See the last two paragraphs of Sec. I in
Ref. [4] for a brief comparison of this extended version of general relativity and the standard version, which considers only nondegenerate metrics.) With an appropriate differential
structure and trivial spacetime topology, a nonsingular spatially flat Friedmann-type solution of the Einstein gravitational field equation has been obtained, where the curvature and
the matter energy density remain finite (these quantities diverge for the standard Friedmann
solution). Most interestingly, this nonsingular Friedmann-type solution suggests the existence of a “pre-big-bang” phase (in standard terminology) with a bounce-type behavior of
the cosmic scale factor.
The aim of the present article is to review this nonsingular bounce, which remains within
the realm of general relativity, and to obtain a better understanding of the nonsingular
bouncing cosmology by performing exploratory calculations of certain cosmological observables. Even though, at this moment, these cosmological observables are only accessible
through Gedankenexperiments, it is instructive to discuss them. In the Appendix, we also
give an explicit realization of a particular classical nonsingular bouncing cosmology that
was discussed in Ref. [3] (this cosmology has a different matter content before and after the
bounce). The model of the Appendix allows us to obtain a qualitative upper bound on the
length scale of the spacetime defect which has replaced the big bang singularity.
II.

NONSINGULAR BOUNCE WITH A CONSTANT EQUATION OF STATE

We start from the classical spacetime manifold of Ref. [4], but use a simplified version
of the cosmic time coordinate T and consider only the T -even solution for the cosmic scale
factor a(T ). In this way, we obtain a modified spatially flat Friedmann–Lemaı̂tre–Robertson–
Walker (FLRW) universe with a bounce-type behavior of a(T ). We can be relatively brief
in this section, as further details can be found in Refs. [4–7]. Throughout, we use natural
units with c = 1 and ~ = 1.
With a cosmic time coordinate T and comoving spatial Cartesian coordinates {x1 , x2 , x3 },
an appropriate Ansatz for the metric is given by [4]

(2.1d)

where the function a(T ) in (2.1a) is, strictly speaking, not the same as the function a(τ ) in
(3.6) of Ref [4]. The parameter b in the metric (2.1a) corresponds to the characteristic length
scale of the spacetime defect localized at T = 0 (see Refs. [4–7] and references therein). For
the moment, b is simply a model parameter and we remain agnostic as to its physical origin.
It may be that b is related to the Planck length, but it is also possible that b is related to a
new fundamental length scale of quantum spacetime [8].
We observe that the metric (2.1a) is degenerate, with det gµν = 0 at T = 0. The
corresponding T = 0 spacetime slice may be interpreted as a 3-dimensional “defect” of
spacetime with topology R3 . The standard elementary-flatness condition does not hold at
the location of this spacetime defect; see App. D in Ref. [5] and Sec. 2 D in Ref. [6] for
further discussion. As will be seen shortly, the metric (2.1a) removes the big bang curvature
singularity, but does so at the price of introducing a spacetime defect. We also remark that
a degenerate metric evades certain singularity theorems; cf. Sec. 3.1.5 in Ref. [7].
Later on, we will simplify the calculations away from the spacetime defect by use of the
auxiliary coordinate τ instead of T . These two coordinates are related as follows (Fig. 1):
 √
+ τ 2 − b2 ,
T (τ ) =
−√ τ 2 − b2 ,

for τ ≥ b ,
for τ ≤ −b ,

τ ∈ (−∞, −b] ∪ [b, ∞) .

(2.2a)
(2.2b)

The inverted relation reads
 √
+ b2 + T 2 ,
τ (T ) =
−√b2 + T 2 ,

for T ≥ 0 ,

(2.3)

for T ≤ 0 ,

which is multivalued at T = 0. The advantage of using the auxiliary coordinate τ is that the
metric (2.1a) takes the standard spatially flat FLRW form, ds2 = −dτ 2 + a2 (τ ) δkl dxk dxl ,
and that the reduced field equations are nonsingular. But it is important to realize that the
coordinate transformation from T to τ is not a diffeomorphism (an invertible C∞ function
by definition): the function (2.3) is discontinuous between T = 0− and T = 0+ , as is the
(suitably defined) second derivative. In short, the differential structure of the metric (2.1a)
in terms of T is different from the one of the standard spatially flat FLRW metric in terms
of τ ; see Ref. [6] for a related discussion.
Taking the metric (2.1a) with spacetime coordinates {T, x1 , x2 , x3 } and the energymomentum tensor of a homogeneous perfect fluid, the Einstein equation gives the following
modified spatially flat Friedmann equation and energy-conservation equation, together with

Surgery on the real line with coordinate τ ∈ R gives the cosmic time axis τ ∈

A suitable cosmic time coordinate is given by T ∈ R from (2.2a). Each point of the cosmic time

We emphasize that the new input for this particular nonsingular bouncing cosmology is
the metric Ansatz (2.1a). The other two inputs are standard [9], the Einstein equation and
the energy-momentum tensor of the matter (here, matter with w = 1). The resulting modified Friedmann equation (2.4a), together with the standard equations (2.4b) and (2.4c), then
gives the bounce-type scale factor (2.5). In the next section, we calculate some cosmological
observables for this bounce-type FLRW universe.

COSMOLOGICAL OBSERVABLES
Null geodesics

The background metric is given by (2.1a). Particles travel on straight lines in the coordinate system {T, x1 , x2 , x3 }. So, we can consider geodesics of light that start at T = T1 < 0
and end at T = T0 > 0, while moving in the x1 ≡ X direction. Then, the reduced metric is

The conclusion is that particles, in particular photons and gravitons, can travel from the
prebounce phase to the postbounce phase without hindrance whatsoever.

Past particle horizon

At cosmic time T0 > 0, the past particle horizon is infinite, as the universe extends back
in time indefinitely. Explicitly, the particle horizon at T0 > 0 reads

which goes to +∞. In other words, the past particle horizon at a finite positive cosmic time
T0 diverges for this particular bounce-type universe.
With an infinite particle horizon, there may be no horizon and flatness problems to worry
about, and no need for inflation [10] (further references on inflationary models can be found
in Ref. [11]). A succinct comparison between nonsingular bouncing cosmology models and
big bang inflationary models appears in Ref. [3].
C.

Modified Hubble diagrams

It is a straightforward exercise to calculate the luminosity distance dL as a function of
the redshift z, provided we distinguish two cases:
6

1. the light is emitted by a comoving source in the expanding phase of the universe
(T1 > 0);
2. the light is emitted by a comoving source in the contracting phase of the universe
(T1 ≤ 0).
In both cases, the light is detected by a comoving observer in the expanding phase at cosmic
time T0 > 0 with T0 > T1 .
Using the auxiliary time coordinate τ from (2.3) with scale factor (2.7) and adapting the
relevant formulae in Secs. 14.4 and 14.6 of Ref. [9], we obtain

The modified Hubble diagram with the luminosity distance dL (z) is plotted in the leftpanel of Fig. 4 and the one with the angular diameter distance dA (z) in the right-panel. The
nonsmooth behavior at z = zmax in Fig. 4 is a direct manifestation of the spacetime defect
and will be discussed further in Sec. III D.
The results in Fig. 4 are shown for a relatively small value of zmax , in order to display
the main characteristics of the modified Hubble diagrams. For very large values of zmax
(as will appear in Sec. IV), it makes more sense to use a compactified redshift coordinate
and to compress (or compactify) the distance axis. Specifically, we can use the following
compactified variables:

(3.11c)

The resulting modified Hubble diagrams are shown in Fig. 5 for three values of zmax .
After we completed our calculation of the luminosity distance, we became aware of
Ref. [12], which discusses certain phenomenological aspects of a nonsingular bouncing cosmology but not the dynamics of the bounce. The behavior of the n = 1/2 curve in Fig. 1
of Ref. [12] agrees with the more or less constant behavior of the dashed curve in Fig. 4 of
a previous version of this article [14], which considered the w = 1/3 case.
In the next two subsections, we will discuss these modified Hubble diagrams in more
detail.
D.

Cusps in the modified Hubble diagrams

The cusp behavior seen in Fig. 4 is of interest in that it shows that the spacetime defect
at T = 0 (or τ = ±b) is not just a coordinate artifact, as it leads to observable effects.

The discontinuity of the derivative dL′ (z) at zmax from (3.7a) and (3.7b) traces back to the
nontrivial τ1 behavior in (3.5), due to the sharp change in slope of a(τ1 ) between τ1 ≤ −b and
τ1 ≥ b. This change of slope is explained by two facts (the overdot stands for differentiation
with respect to τ ). First, the modified first-order Friedmann equation (2.4a) in terms of
the auxiliary coordinate τ implies that the value of (ȧ/a)2 at τ = ±b is nonvanishing if
the value of ρ is. Second, the nonzero value of ȧ/a can change sign between τ = −b and
τ = +b, because the interval between these two points (∆τ = 2 b) is nonvanishing, as long as
b is nonzero. Incidentally, we have also calculated dL (z) from (3.5) with an ad hoc function
a(τ ) = 1 + (τ 2 /b2 − 1)2 and find that the cusp in the resulting modified Hubble diagram is
absent.
The possible cusp behavior of the luminosity distance dL (z) has, to the best of our
knowledge, not been obtained before in other bouncing models. In Ref. [12], the authors did
calculate the luminosity distances for different contracting phases but did not give a complete
description, from contraction to expansion. Needless to say, a complete description of the
luminosity distance is far from trivial for most of the bouncing models in the literature, as
it depends on the details of the bouncing models (especially the dynamics at the bounce
moment). As shown in Sec. III C, our bouncing model not only gives a complete description
of the luminosity distance (or the angular diameter distance) but also displays a nontrivial
effect such as the cusp behavior, which may be regarded as a characteristic of our bouncing
model.

E.

Gedankenexperiment

Assume that modified Hubble diagrams for dL (z) and dA (z) have been established. Then,
we may consider a Gedankenexperiment to determine the numerical value of b (presupposing
the relevance of the nonsingular bounce model of Sec. II to the real Universe). The simplest
possible Gedankenexperiment uses only the modified dL (z) Hubble diagram and proceeds in
three steps.
First, determine the numerical value of zmax from the modified dL (z) Hubble diagram,
where the zmax value corresponds to the z-coordinate of the intersection point of the case-1
curve (3.7a) and the case-2 curve (3.7b); compare with, respectively, the full and dashed
curves in the left-panel of Fig 4. With the obtained zmax value, calculate
ΞL ≡ 1 + zmax .

(3.12)

In this subsection, we use upper-case Greek letters to denote experimental quantities.
Second, determine, in the modified dL (z) Hubble diagram, the numerical value of the
slope of the upper (case-2) curve just below z = zmax ,

where the last identification results from (3.7b). In principle, it is also possible to obtain
other experimental quantities [for example, from the behavior of the curvature of the case-2
dL (z) curve just above z = −1], but the choice (3.13) suffices for the moment.
Third, the numerical value of b then follows from the previously determined values ΞL
and ΣL by calculating
1
bnum = − ΣL ΞL .
3

(3.14)

With zmax significantly larger than 1, the numerical value of b in (3.14) results from multiplying a reduced value (ΣL ) by a large number (ΞL ). Note also that the dL (z) function
obtained for the w = 1/3 case [14] gives the same result as in (3.14) but with the fraction
1/3 on the right-hand side replaced by 1/2.
Needless to say, we neglect all practical difficulties in this Gedankenexperiment, if at all
feasible. A discussion of the cosmological context is given in Sec. IV.
IV.

DISCUSSION

The construction of the spacetime manifold in Ref. [4] is entirely classical. But it could
very well be that the classical length parameter b appearing in the metric (2.1a) has its
origin in the (unknown) theory of “quantum spacetime,” with a fundamental length scale
related to the Planck length or not [8]. It is, then, possible to imagine that this quantum
theory removes the classical times τ ∈ (−b, b) in Fig. 1 and ties together τ = −b and τ = b,
so that the resulting interval of the emerging classical time coordinate T = T (τ ) has no
boundary. In that case, there must be a classical “pre-big-bang” phase T ≤ 0 and, in this
article, we have studied some cosmological consequences (one example being the cusps in
the modified Hubble diagrams of Fig. 4, as explained in Sec. III D).
Assuming the relevance of the nonsingular bounce model of Sec. II, we have discussed,
in Sec. III E, a Gedankenexperiment to determine the numerical value of the length scale b
entering the metric (2.1a). The required observations for this Gedankenexperiment would
concern images originating before the known epoch of the “hot big bang” (postbounce in
our model universe), which contains a hot plasma that would strongly scatter the light of
any assumed “standard candles” (or “standard-size objects”) in the prebounce phase. But
it may very well be that the required standard candles emit gravitational waves instead of
electromagnetic waves (light). For example, it is possible to consider a gravitational standard
candle from a binary-black-hole merger [13] with definite masses (giving a recognizable
“chirp”); see Ref. [12] for further discussion.
Hence, the Gedankenexperiment of Sec. III E relies on gravitational standard candles.
The cosmological scenario for which this Gedankenexperiment may be relevant is as follows.
In the prebounce phase and just after the bounce, the matter content of the universe can
be described by a homogeneous perfect fluid with a constant equation-of-state parameter
w = 1. The particular value w ≥ 1 agrees with the absence of instabilities in the prebounce
phase, as discussed in the third and fourth paragraphs of Sec 4 in Ref. [3], which also contains
11

further references. After the bounce, the matter content of the universe changes to that of
a homogeneous perfect fluid with w ∼ 1/3, attributed to the presence of ultrarelativistic
particles. In the Appendix, we present a model with a postbounce change of the equationof-state parameter.
Even if the cosmological scenario as discussed holds true, there are formidable hurdles
to overcome before the Gedankenexperiment can be converted into a realistic experiment.
We only mention two. The first major hurdle (perhaps the most important one) concerns
the actual presence and identification of the required gravitational standard candles (or
gravitational standard-size objects), present before and after the bounce. The second major
hurdle concerns the measurement of b by use of (3.14). Using the known postbounce age
of the universe (c τ0 ≈ 1010 lyr ≈ 1026 m) and taking the maximum allowed value for b
from (A6b), we get the following estimate from (3.7c) adapted to the postbounce expansion
a(τ ) ∝ τ 1/2 for the model of the Appendix:

This large number 1015 (or an even larger number if, for example, b is very much below the
millimeter scale) makes the determination of b difficult, as mentioned in the sentence below
(3.14). The slope entering (3.13), in particular, is suppressed by, at least, a factor 10−15 ,
making it hard to measure.
The experiment as outlined above will stay, for a long time to come, a Gedankenexperiment and the discussion will remain entirely academic. Still, the general idea appears to be
valid and may perhaps be adapted to other circumstances.
Up till now, we have been talking primarily about direct images of prebounce structures
(e.g., hypothetical binary-black-hole mergers emitting gravitational waves). But, as mentioned in Fig. 4 of Ref. [3], the currently observed “superhorizon” patterns in the cosmic
microwave background may also be due to a prebounce phase, assuming that there has been
such a phase. Hence, the crucial question is whether or not a cosmic bounce has occurred
and, if so, what physics is responsible. The intriguing result from general relativity, extended to allow for degenerate metrics, is that a particular “regularization” of the standard
big bang singularity indeed suggests the occurrence of a cosmic bounce.

NOTE ADDED

The present article is a follow-up paper of Ref. [4]. There are now two more followup papers. The first of these papers [15] provides a scalar-field model for the type of
time-asymmetric nonsingular bounce constructed in the Appendix. The second of these
papers [16] gives a detailed analysis of the dynamics near the bounce.

Appendix A: Nonsingular bounce with a variable equation of state

In this Appendix, we give some results for a modified spatially flat FLRW universe with
a time-dependent equation-of-state parameter. In fact, we take our cue from the general
discussion of a particular classical nonsingular bouncing cosmology in Ref. [3]. With the
notation ǫ ≡ (3/2)(1 + P/ρ) ≡ (3/2)(1 + W ), Sec. 4 of that paper states: “According to
the bouncing scenario, at some point during or shortly after the bounce, the kinetic energy
stored in scalar fields is converted to the matter and radiation we observe, with ǫ ≤ 2. The
irreversible reheating process accounts for the asymmetry in ǫ about the bounce point.”
The main characteristics of that nonsingular bouncing cosmology are summarized in Fig. 3
of Ref. [3] and the goal of the present Appendix is to present a “fully-computable bounce
model,” as mentioned in Sec. 6 of Ref. [3].
With reduced-Planckian units (8πGN = c = ~ = 1), the modified spatially flat Friedmann
equation, the energy-conservation equation, and the assumed equation of state are given by

By reverting temporarily to the auxiliary coordinate τ from (2.3) and by focusing on the
Hubble parameter h(τ ) ≡ a−1 (τ ) [da(τ )/dτ ] it is possible to get an analytic result:

From (A2a) and (A2c), we have H(T ) ∼ (1/3) T −1 < 0 for T ≪ −b and H(T ) ∼ (1/2) T −1 >
0 for T ≫ b.
It does not appear possible to get a(T ) in an explicit analytic form, but the ordinary
differential equation from (A2a) can be solved numerically for a(T ). Figure 6 shows the
cosmological functions for a particular choice of model parameters, where the bottom-right
panel displays the time asymmetry of the cosmic scale factor, a(T ) 6= a(−T ) for T 6= 0. The
corresponding luminosity distance dL and angular diameter distance dA (Fig. 7) are found
to be qualitatively the same as those from Sec. III (Fig. 4).
From (A2b) and (A2c), we find that the maximum value of the energy density (which
occurs at T = 0) remains finite, provided the defect length scale b is nonzero

Such a minimal length scale is also expected, on general grounds, for the emerging classical
