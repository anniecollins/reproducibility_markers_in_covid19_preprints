Abstract
Individual localized spins in semiconductors are attracting significant interest in the frame of
quantum technologies including quantum information and quantum enhanced sensing. Localized
spins of magnetic atoms incorporated in a semiconductor are particularly promising for quantum
sensing. Here we demonstrate that the spin of a Cr atom in a quantum dot (QD) can be controlled
optically and we discuss the main properties of this single spin system. The photoluminescence of
individual Cr-doped QDs and their evolution in magnetic field reveal a large magnetic anisotropy
of the Cr spin induced by local strain. This results in a splitting of the Cr spin states and in a
thermalization on the lower energy states states Sz =0 and Sz =±1. The magneto-optical properties
of Cr-doped QDs can be modelled by an effective spin Hamiltonian including the spin to strain
coupling and the influence of the QD symmetry. We also show that a single Cr spin can be
prepared by resonant optical pumping. Monitoring the intensity of the resonant fluorescence of
the QD during this process permits to probe the dynamics of the optical initialization of the spin.
Hole-Cr flip-flops induced by an interplay of the hole-Cr exchange interaction and the coupling
with acoustic phonons are the main source of relaxation that explains the efficient resonant optical
pumping. The Cr spin relaxation time is measured in the µs range. We evidence that a Cr
spin couples to non-equilibrium acoustic phonons generated during the optical excitation inside
or near the QD). Finally we show that the energy of any spin state of an individual Cr atom
can be independently tuned by a resonant single mode laser through the optical Stark effect. All
these properties make Cr-doped QDs very promising for the development of hybrid spin-mechanical
systems where a coherent mechanical driving of an individual spin in an oscillator is required.

INTRODUCTION

Individual spins in semiconductors are promising for the development of quantum technologies based on solid state devices. Important progresses have been made recently for
spins of carriers confined in nano-structures1 and for electronic and nuclear spins localized on
individual defects2 . Diluted magnetic semiconductor systems combining high quality nanostructures and localized spins on transition metal elements are alternative good candidates
for the development of such single spin quantum devices. Optically active quantum dots
(QDs) containing individual or pairs of magnetic dopants can be realized both in II-VI3–8
and III-V9,10 semiconductors. In these systems, since the confined carriers and magnetic
atom spins are strongly mixed, an optical excitation of the QD can affect the spin state of
the atom offering possibilities for probing and controlling of the localized spin11,12 .
The variety of 3d transition metal magnetic elements that can be incorporated in conventional semiconductors gives a large choice of localized electronic and nuclear spins as well
as orbital momentum3,13–15 . For a given semiconductor nano-structure, the spin properties
resulting from the exchange interaction between the confined carriers and the incorporated
magnetic dopant depend on the filling of the 3d orbital of the atom. The choice of a particular
magnetic element can then be adapted for a targeted application. This approach opens a diversity of possible use of individual spins in diluted magnetic semiconductor nano-structures
for quantum information technologies or quantum sensing.
Among these magnetic atoms, chromium (Cr) is of particular interest15 . It usually incorporates in intrinsic II-VI semiconductors as Cr2+ carrying an electronic spin S=2 and an
orbital momentum L=2. Moreover, most of Cr isotopes have no nuclear spin. This simplifies
the spin level structure and the coherent dynamics of its electronic spin16 . With bi-axial
strain, the ground state of the Cr is expected to be an orbital singlet with a spin degeneracy
of 5. The non zero orbital momentum (L=2) of the Cr atom connects its electronic spin
to the local strain through the modification of the crystal field and the spin-orbit coupling.
This spin to strain coupling is expected to be more than two orders of magnitude larger
than for elements without orbital momentum like NV centers in diamond19 or Mn atoms in
II-VI semiconductors20 .
In analogy with the spin structure of NV centers in diamond, the spin states Sz = ±1 of
a Cr2+ ion in a QD form a spin qubit coupled to in-plane strain21 . The Cr spin is therefore

2

promising for the realization of hybrid spin-mechanical systems17,18 in which the motion of
a mechanical oscillator would be coherently coupled to the spin state of a single atom and
probed or coherently controlled through this interaction19,22,23 .
This review article is organized as follows: after a short presentation of the spin properties
of magnetic atoms in semiconductors and their exchange interaction with the carriers of
the host we discuss how we can use the optical properties of a QD to probe the spin of
an individual Cr. We show that magneto-optics is an efficient tool to extract the relevant
parameters of the QDs and the strength of carriers-Cr exchange interaction. We then present
optical techniques for to control the Cr spin (resonant optical pumping and energy tuning
by optical Stark effect) and discuss the dynamics of Cr spin in the presence of optically
created carriers or in the dark. We finally show that Cr atoms in a QD forms an interesting
platform for the study of the coupling of individual spins with propagating surface acoustic
phonons which are proposed as efficient quantum bus between different kinds of qubits24 .

SPIN PROPERTIES OF MAGNETIC ATOMS IN SEMICONDUCTORS

The important properties of individual magnetic atoms in diluted magnetic semiconductors arise from (i) their fine (and hyperfine) structure, which controls the spin dynamics at
zero or weak magnetic field and (ii) the exchange interaction with the carriers of the host,
which determines the conditions of optical and electrical control. We will discuss here the
origin of these two parameters for Cr embedded in CdTe/ZnTe QDs and compare with more
extensively studied Mn-doped systems.

A.

Fine and hyperfine structure of a magnetic atom in a II-VI semiconductor

Cr atoms are usually incorporated into un-doped II-VI semiconductors as Cr2+ ions on
cation sites forming a deep impurity level. The ground state of a free Cr2+ is 5 D with the
orbital quantum number L=2 and a spin S=2 yielding a 25-fold degeneracy. In the crystal
field of Td symmetry of the tetrahedral cation site in zinc-blende crystal, the degeneracy is
partially lifted (see Figure 1): the 5 D term splits into 15-fold degenerate orbital triplet 5 T2
and 10-fold degenerate orbital doublet 5 E. The Jahn-Teller distortion reduces the symmetry
to D2d and leads to a splitting of the 5 T2 ground state into a 5-fold degenerate 5 B2 orbital

The ground state orbital singlet 5 B2 is further split by the spin-orbit interaction. In a
strain free crystal, it was found that the ground state splitting can be described by the spin
effective Hamiltonian16 :

with |D0 |  |a|, |F |. For the studies reported here, it is a good approximation to take
a = 0 and F = 0. The x, y, z principal axes were found to coincide with the cubic axes
(1,2,3) giving rise to three identical sites, each given by (1) but with the z axis of each
along a different cubic axis (1,2,3). A value of D0 ≈ +30µeV was estimated from Electron
Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) measurements in highly diluted bulk Cr-doped CdTe16 .
Static biaxial compressive strain in the (001) plane, as observed in self-assembled QDs,
reduces the symmetry to D2d and destabilize the Cr 3d orbitals dxz and dyz having an
electron density pointing along the [001] axis (z axis). The Cr ground state is then a 5fold spin degenerated orbital singlet formed from the dxy orbital. It corresponds to the
Jahn-Teller ground state with a tetragonal distortion along the [001] axis25 .
An additional applied stress will influence the Cr spin fine structure through the modification of the crystal field and the spin-orbit interaction. For an arbitrary strain tensor, the
general form of the Cr ground state spin effective Hamiltonian is16

where we can estimate a magnetic anisotropy D0 ≈ 1±0.6 meV from the values of the spin to

An anisotropy of the strain in the QD plane (001) would affect the Cr fine structure
through the tetragonal coefficients c3 and c4 . The largest spin to strain coupling is expected
6

for a strain along [110] direction (coefficient c4 ) with εxy = εyx 6= 0 and εxx = εyy = 0. This
interaction can be described by an additional term in the spin-strain Hamiltonian

This anisotropy term couples spin states separated by two units and in particular Sz =+1
and Sz =-1 which are initially degenerated in the absence of magnetic field. As we will see in
the last section, such term, together with terms proportional to xx − yy , can be exploited to
induce a strain mediated coherent coupling between a mechanical oscillator and a Cr spin.
The situation is different for a Mn atom which, incorporated as a Mn2+ ion in II-VI
compounds, has no orbital momentum. As the ground state of the Mn2+ has no orbital
degeneracy it is not affected by the Td crystal field nor by the reduction of its symmetry
by biaxial strain. However the spin degeneracy is lifted by a combination of spin-orbit
interaction and reduced symmetry of the crystal field. As in the case of Cr this results in a
splitting of the spin levels according to D0 Sz2 but with D0 at least two orders of magnitude
weaker than in the Cr case (values around 7µeV were measured in CdTe/ZnTe QDs26,27 .
All the Mn stable isotopes carries a nuclear spin I=5/2. This nuclear spin couples to the
3d electrons via the hyperfine interaction AI.S with A ≈ 0.7µeV . The fine and hyperfine
splitting have similar values and this results in a complex 36 spin level structure responsible
of the rich spin dynamics observed for an individual Mn atom in a QD26,27 .

B.

Exchange interaction between carriers and a magnetic atom

Diluted magnetic semiconductors are characterised by a large exchange interaction between the localized spins of the magnetic atoms and the carriers of the host. The electronmagnetic atom coupling for carriers at the center of the Brillouin zone arises from the
standard short range exchange interaction. It is then ferromagnetic and a value of the exchange energy N0 α ≈ 0.2eV (where N0 is the number of unit cell in a normalized volume) is
found for most of the transition metals incorporated in wide band gap II-VI compounds28 .
The exchange interaction with the hole spin is usually larger than the interaction with
the electron spin and arises from two mechanisms: (i) a ferromagnetic coupling resulting
from the short range exchange interaction and (ii) a spin dependent hybridization of the
7

d orbital of the magnetic atom and the p orbital of the host semiconductor, the so-called
kinetic exchange.
The p − d hybridization is strongly sensitive to the energy splitting between the 3d levels
of the atom and the top of the valence band. This hybridization of course significantly
depends on the considered transition metal element (i.e. filling of the 3d orbital) and, for
a given magnetic element, on the semiconductor host29 . It can be either ferromagnetic or
anti-ferromagnetic depending on the relative position of the d levels and the top of the
valence.
In the case of Mn, the Mn2+/3+ donor level is located far within the valence band and the
kinetic exchange results in an anti-ferromagnetic hole-Mn coupling. The p-d hybridization
has the main contribution to the hole-Mn exchange and the overall interaction is antiferromagnetic. A value of N0 β ≈ −0.88eV has been measured for Mn in CdTe30 .
For a Cr atom in the 3d4 configuration, it has been demonstrated28,31 that the exchange
interaction between a Cr atom with a Jahn-Teller distortion oriented along the [001] axis
(z-axis) and a heavy-hole with a z component of its total angular momentum Jz =±3/2 can
be expressed in the form:

the unperturbed energy of the d shell with N electrons and total spin S, Vpd the

along the [001] axis corresponds to the CdTe/ZnTe QDs where a Cr atom can be optically detected. Such dots are characterized by a large biaxial strain which dominates the
Jahn-Teller effect and orients the Cr spin along the QD growth axis25 .
In the expression (9) controlling the amplitude of the hole-Cr exchange, the first denominator corresponds to the energy e1 required to transfer an electron from the d shell of the Cr
atom to the valence band reducing the total spin from S to S-1/2 (and reducing the number
8

of electrons in the d shell from N to N-1). The denominator of the second term is the energy
e2 required to transfer an electron from the top of the valence band to the d shell also with a
reduction by 1/2 of the total spin (and an increase of the number of electrons in the d shell
from N to N+1). This last energy e2 includes the electron-electron exchange interaction in
the d shell (at the origin of Hund rule) and is then large (a few eV) and always positive.
The sign of B4 controls the sign of the hole-Cr kinetic exchange interaction: a negative
B4 corresponds to an anti-ferromagnetic interaction whereas a positive B4 will give rise to
S−1/2

S
a ferromagnetic interaction. If e1 is negative (EN
− EN −1 > εp ) and 1/e1 < −1/e2 , B4 is

positive. The donor transition Cr2+ to Cr3+ is within the band gap of the semiconductor
and the hole-Cr exchange interaction is ferromagnetic. This is the situation reported until
now for all the studied bulk II-VI compounds containing diluted Cr atoms32 . In particular,
Cr-doped bulk ZnTe exhibits a large ferromagnetic exchange interaction. This is consistent
with the optical observation of the Cr2+/3+ donor level about 0.2 eV above the top of the
valence band in ZnTe33 .
S−1/2

S
− EN −1 < εp ), B4 is negative and the hole-Cr exchange inFor a positive value of e1 (EN

teraction is anti-ferromagnetic. This corresponds to a donor level Cr2+/3+ within the valence
band. According to equation (9), a slight change of the value of e1 around 0 can abruptly
change the hole-Cr exchange from a large ferromagnetic to a large anti-ferromagnetic value.
However, one should note that the calculations leading to the expression of the kinetic exchange interaction (8) contain two important approximations. First, the influence of the
crystal field and strain modified crystal field on the magnetic atom d orbital is neglected.
Secondly, the model is based on a perturbation approach which is not particularly well
adapted when e1 is close to zero as expected for Cr in CdTe or ZnTe.
The hole-Cr exchange interaction has never been measured in bulk CdTe. However, the
energy level of a transition-metal impurity does not significantly change between materials
with common anion29 . The valence band offset between ZnTe and CdTe being around 0.1
eV34 one could also expect that the Cr donor transition in bulk CdTe could be very close but
slightly above the top of the valence band. This should give rise to a ferromagnetic holeCr exchange interaction as observed for Cr-doped ZnTe. However, whereas the acceptor
level Cr2+/1+ has clearly been optically identified in bulk CdTe, the donor level Cr2+/3+
has never been observed. This suggests, following reference35 , that it could be resonant
with the valence band. The resulting hole-Cr exchange interaction would then be large and
9

anti-ferromagnetic.

III.

OPTICAL PROBING OF THE SPIN STATE OF AN INDIVIDUAL CR ATOM

To optically access individual magnetic atoms, Cr are randomly introduced in CdTe/ZnTe
self-assembled QDs grown by Molecular Beam Epitaxy on ZnTe (001) substrates following
the procedure described in ref.36 . The amount of Cr is adjusted to optimize the probability
to detect QDs containing 1 or a few Cr atoms. The emission of individual QDs, induced
by optical excitation with a dye laser tuned on resonance with an excited state of the
dots37 , is studied in magnetic fields (up to 11 T) by optical micro-spectroscopy in Faraday
configuration.

A.

Exciton-Cr in a CdTe/ZnTe quantum dot

The low temperature (T=5K) PL of the neutral exciton coupled to a single Cr spin
(X-Cr) of three individual Cr-doped QDs (QD1, QD2 and QD3) are reported in Figure 2.
Three main emission lines are observed for X-Cr. The relative intensities of the lines and
their splitting change from dot to dot. For some of the dots, a splitting of the central line
is observed and an additional line appears on the low energy side of the X-Cr spectra. All
these features result from the exchange coupling of the electron and hole spins with a single
Cr spin.
When an electron-hole (e-h) pair is injected in a Cr-doped QD, the bright excitons are
split by the exchange interaction between the spins of Cr and carriers. In flat self-assembled
QDs, the heavy-holes and light-holes are separated in energy by the biaxial strain and the
confinement. In a first approximation, the ground state in such QD is a pure heavy-hole
(Jz =±3/2) exciton and the exchange interaction with the Cr spin S is described by the spin
Hamiltonian

~ · ~σ + IhCr Sz Jz
Hc−Cr = IeCr S

(10)

with ~σ the electron spin and Jz the hole spin operator. IeCr and IhCr are, respectively, the
exchange integrals of the electron and the hole spins with the Cr spin. These exchange

energies depend on the exchange constant of the 3d electrons of the Cr with the carriers in
CdTe and on the overlap of the Cr atom with the confined carriers.
For highly strained CdTe/ZnTe QDs with a weak hole confinement, the strain induced
energy splitting of the Cr spin D0 Sz2 is much larger than the exchange energy with the
confined carriers (D0  |IhCr | > |IeCr |). The exchange interaction with the exciton acts as
an effective magnetic field which further splits the Cr spins states Sz =±1 and Sz =±2. The

coupled to the spin of the Cr (X-Cr) in a strained Cr-doped QD. Vertical arrows indicates the main
optical transition with their dominant polarization either linear (π) or circular (σ).

resulting X-Cr energy levels are presented in Figure 3. The exciton recombination does not
affect the Cr atom and its spin is conserved during the optical transitions. Consequently, the
large strained induced splitting of the Cr spin is not directly observed in the optical spectra.
However, at low temperature, the Cr spin thermalize on the low energy states Sz =0 and
Sz =±1. This leads to a PL dominated by three contributions: A central line corresponding
to Sz =0 and the two outer lines associated with Sz =±1 split by the exchange interaction
with the carriers.
As presented in the case of QD3 in Figure4, most of the Cr-doped QDs exhibit a linear
polarization dependence. The central line is split and linearly polarized along two orthogonal
directions (lines (2) and (3)). As in non-magnetic QDs, this results from a coupling of the
two bright excitons by (i) the long range e-h exchange interaction in QDs with an in-plane
shape anisotropy and/or (ii) the short range exchange interaction in the presence of valence
band mixing. This anisotropic e-h exchange interaction energy mixes the bright exciton
associated with the same Cr spin state inducing an additional splitting between them. The

12

mixing is maximum for the central bright exciton lines which are initially degenerated. The
outer lines (lines (1) and (4)) are also partially linearly polarized but the influence of the e-h
exchange interaction is here attenuated by the initial splitting of the bright excitons induced
by the exchange interaction with the Cr spin Sz = ±1.

(c) Time-resolved PL of QD3 recorded on the two outer lines (line (1) and (4)) and on the low
energy line (5).

In many Cr-doped QDs, an additional line appears on the low energy side of the PL
spectra at zero magnetic field. As presented in Figure 4 for QD3, this line presents a longer
lifetime. It arises from a dark exciton (total angular momentum ±2) which acquires some
13

oscillator strength by a mixing with a bright exciton interacting with the same Cr spin
state15 . This dark/bright exciton mixing is induced by the e-h exchange interaction in a
confining potential of low symmetry38 .
Let us note finally that in the presence of electrical doping and/or optical excitation,
charge transfer from the Cr atom to the band of the semiconductor or to other localized
levels may occur leading to changes in the d shell configuration and in the charge states of
the Cr. This is in particular the case for Cr in ZnTe where the donor and level Cr2+/3+ and
the acceptor level Cr2+/1+ are both within the band gap. Such fluctuation of the charge
state of a Cr atom has been observed optically for Cr atoms located in the ZnTe barriers
close to a QD39 . Fluctuation of the charge of the Cr between Cr2+ and Cr+ could also be
possible for a Cr in CdTe as the acceptor level Cr2+/1+ is within the band gap close to the
conduction band. Such fluctuation between a 3d4 (S=2) and a 3d5 (S=5/2) magnetic atom
has never been identified until now in the spectra of individual QDs.

B.

Magneto optical properties of Cr-doped quantum dots

The structure of the energy levels in QDs containing a Cr2+ ion is confirmed by the
evolution of the PL spectra in magnetic field. The circularly polarized PL of QD1 and QD4
under a magnetic field applied along the QD growth axis are presented in Figure 5. Under
a magnetic field the exciton states | ⇓h ↑e i = | − 1i and | ⇑h ↓e i = | + 1i are split by the
Zeeman energy. This splitting can compensate the exciton splitting induced by the exchange
interaction with the Cr (anti-crossing (1) at Bz =0 T in Figure 5(a))40 . For QD1, this results
in an anti-crossing of | + 1i and | − 1i excitons due to the e-h exchange interaction around
Bz =6 T observed both in σ+ and σ- polarizations (anti-crossing (2) and (3) in Figure 5(a)).
An anti-crossing of the low energy dark exciton with the bright excitons is observed under
Bz in σ- polarization (anti-crossing (4) in Figure 5(a)). As illustrated in Figure 6 this anticrossing arises from a mixing of the bright and dark excitons interacting with the same Cr
spin state. Observed in σ- polarization, it corresponds to the mixing of the exciton states
| − 1i and | + 2i coupled to the Cr spin Sz =-1. This dark/bright exciton coupling δ12 is
induced by the e-h exchange interaction in a confining potential of reduced symmetry (lower
than C2v )38 . In such symmetry, the dark excitons acquire an in-plane dipole moment which
lead to possible optical recombination at zero magnetic field41 as observed in QD3 and QD4.

QD under a longitudinal magnetic field.

QDs (See QD4 in Figure 5). Under a magnetic field applied along the QD growth axis, a
maximum of PL intensity is observed on the high energy side of the exciton-Cr spectra in
σ− polarization and on the low energy side in σ+ polarization. This change in the intensity distribution is more or less pronounced from one dot to another (see QD1 and QD4
in Figure 5) but always presents the same tendency and easier to observe at low excitation
intensity52 . Such distribution, with a maximum of PL intensity on the high energy side in σpolarization (which shifts to low energy under Bz >0) and on the low energy side in σ+ polarization, is identical to the one observed in CdTe/ZnTe QDs doped with a single Mn atom.
In these systems, the hole-Mn exchange interaction is known to be anti-ferromagnetic43 and
approximately four times larger than the ferromagnetic electron-Mn exchange interaction.
Under a longitudinal magnetic field the Cr spin states Sz = ±1 in the empty QD are
split by the Zeeman energy gCr µB Bz with a Lande factor gCr ≈ 2. Among the Zeeman
doublet Sz = ±1, the Cr spin thermalizes on the lowest energy Cr spin state Sz = −1 at low
temperature. At moderate excitation power where the exciton-Cr PL intensity distribution
is not dominated by the carriers-Cr spin-flips, this population distribution can be partially

16

mapped on the exciton-Cr PL. When an unpolarized exciton is injected in the QD, the
energy position of the most populated states with Sz = −1, on the high energy or the
low energy side of the exciton PL spectra, depends on the sign of the exciton-Cr exchange
interaction. This exchange interaction results from the sum of the electron-Cr and hole-Cr
exchange interactions.
The intensity distribution observed under magnetic field in the studied Cr-doped QDs
(see QD4 in Figure5) shows that the exciton-Cr state |Sz = −1i| ⇓h ↑e i is at high energy
whereas the state |Sz = −1i| ⇑h ↓e i is at low energy. This corresponds, for a CdTe/ZnTe QD,
to an anti-ferromagnetic exchange interaction between the heavy-hole and the Cr spins. The
sign of this interaction could however be different in bulk CdTe. For a CdTe QD in a ZnTe
barrier, the biaxial strain can decrease the energy of the ground heavy hole levels, e1 can
become negative and the resulting exchange interaction can therefore be anti-ferromagnetic.
The strain induced modification of the crystal field can also significantly influence the energy
level of the d orbital of the Cr and modify the kinetic exchange with the nearby hole spins
at the top of the valence band. A more detailed model should be developed to properly
describe the influence of the hybridisation in these strained and confined systems where the
d levels of the magnetic atom are close in energy with the edge of the valence band.
Investigating both the biexciton (X 2 ) and the exciton (X) in the same Cr-doped QD,
we can also analyze the impact of the carrier-Cr interaction on the fine structure of the Cr
spin. The magnetic field dependence of X2 -Cr and X-Cr emissions in QD2 are presented as
a contour plot in Figure 7(c) and (d) respectively. The PL under magnetic field of X-Cr and
X2 -Cr present a mirror symmetry. In particular, the dark/bright exciton mixing observed
around Bz =2.5T on the low energy side of the PL in σ− polarization for X-Cr is observed
on the high energy side in σ+ polarization for X2 -Cr (circles in Figure 7(c) and (d)).

Modeling of Cr-doped quantum dots

To estimate the relevant parameters of a the Cr-doped QDs from the optical spectra the,
we calculated the magneto-optic behavior of Cr-doped QDs by diagonalizing the complete
Hamiltonian of the electron-hole-Cr system. We consider the general case of QDs with a
symmetry lower than C2v (truncated ellipsoidal lens for instance38 ), and take into account the
influence of this reduced symmetry on the valence band and on the e-h exchange interaction.

The electron-hole exchange interaction, He−h , contains the short range and the long
range parts. The short range contribution is a contact interaction which induces a splitting
δ0sr of the bright and dark excitons and, in the reduced symmetry of a zinc-blend crystal
(Td ), a coupling δ2sr of the two dark excitons. The long range part also contributes to the
bright-dark splitting by an energy δ0lr . In QDs with C2v symmetry (ellipsoidal flat lenses
for instance38 ) the long range part also induces a coupling δ1 between the bright excitons.
Realistic self-assembled QDs have symmetries which can deviate quite substantially from the
idealized shapes of circular or ellipsoidal lenses. For a Cs symmetry (truncated ellipsoidal
lens), additional terms coupling the dark and the bright excitons have to be included in the
electron-hole exchange Hamiltonian. Following Ref.38 , the general form of the electron-hole
exchange Hamiltonian in the heavy-hole exciton basis | + 1i, | − 1i, | + 2i, | − 2i for a low
symmetry QD (Cs ) is

The terms δ11 and δ12 , not present in symmetry C2v , give an in-plane dipole moment to
the dark excitons41 . The term δ12 which couples | ± 1i and | ∓ 2i excitons respectively is
responsible for the dark-bright anti-crossing observed on the low energy side (lines (4) and
(5)) of the emission of Cr-doped QDs.
The band Hamiltonian, Hband = Eg +Hvbm , stands for the energy of the electrons (i.e. the
band gap energy Eg ), and the heavy-holes (hh) and light-holes (lh) energies (Hvbm )37,42 . To
describe the influence of a reduced symmetry of the QD on the valence band, we considered
here the four lowest energy hole states |J, Jz i with angular momentum J = 3/2. A general
19

form of Hamiltonian describing the influence of shape or strain anisotropy on the valence
band structure can be written in the basis (| 23 , + 32 i, | 32 , + 12 i, | 23 , − 21 i, | 23 , − 32 i) as:

(15)

Here, r describes the heavy-hole / light-hole mixing induced by an anisotropy in the
(xy) plane of the QD plane and s takes into account an asymmetry in the plane containing
the QD growth axis z. The reduction of symmetry can come from the shape of the QD
(Luttinger Hamiltonian) or the strain distribution (Bir and Pikus Hamiltonian). ∆lh is the
splitting between lh and hh which is controlled both by the in-plane biaxial strain and the
confinement.
Considering only an in-plane anisotropy (s = 0), it follows from (15) that the valence
band mixing couples the heavy-holes Jz = ±3/2 and the light-holes Jz = ∓1/2 respectively.
For such mixing, the isotropic part of the short range exchange interaction, which can be
→
−

σ . J ), couples the two bright excitons. This mixing is also
written in the form 2/3δ0sr (→
responsible for a weak z-polarized dipole matrix element of the dark excitons coming from
the light-hole part of the hole wave function.
A deformation in a vertical plane (s term) couples the heavy-holes Jz = ±3/2 and the
light-holes Jz = ±1/2 respectively. In this case, the short range electron-hole exchange
interaction couples | + 1i and | + 2i exciton on one side and | − 1i and | − 2i exciton on the
other side.
For a general description and as it was observed in Mn-doped QDs37,43,44 , we can also
take into account the perturbation of the wave function of the exciton in the initial state
of the optical transition by the hole-Cr exchange interaction. This perturbation depends on
the value of the exchange energy between the Cr and hole spins and can be represented,
using second order perturbation theory, by an effective spin Hamiltonian37,43,44

we can compute the spectrum of a QD containing a Cr atom. The occupation of the XCr levels is described by an effective spin temperature Tef f and the optical transitions
probabilities are obtained calculating the matrix elements |hSz |X, Sz i|2 where X and Sz
stands for the 8 possible exciton states (4 hh excitons and 4 lh excitons) and the Cr spin
respectively. The resulting PL spectra calculated with the parameters listed in table II are
presented in Figure8. The PL of X-Cr at zero field and its evolution in magnetic field can be
qualitatively reproduced. In particular, the description of the spin states occupation by Tef f
is sufficient to reproduce the observed emission from the three low energy X-Cr levels (Cr
spin states Sz =0 and Sz =±1). The splitting of the central line at zero field (anti-crossing
(1)) and the anti-crossings under magnetic field (anti-crossings (2) and (3) around Bz =6T
for the Cr spin states Sz =+1 and anti-crossings (4) with the dark exciton around Bz =2T)
are also well reproduced by the model.
This model also predicts an anti-crossing around Bz =5T, noted (5) in Figure8, caused by
an electron-Cr flip-flop which is not observed in the experiments. Its position is controlled
by D0 and its width by IeCr . A low value of IeCr is required to keep the width of the anticrossing smaller than the width of the PL lines. Finally an additional anti-crossing, labeled
(6), appears in the model at high magnetic field in σ− polarization. It is due to the mixing
of bright and dark excitons associated with the same spin state of the Cr, in this case Sz =0.
21

Such anti-crossing is observed in some of the Cr doped QDs, like QD4 in Figure5. Similar
bright/dark mixing induced by the electron-hole exchange interaction in low symmetry QDs
can also be observed in non-magnetic QDs42 .

The model reproduces quite well the main features of the magnetic field dependence of
Cr-doped QDs, however the magnetic anisotropy D0 cannot be precisely extracted from the

|Sz = 0i| ⇓h ↑e i would appear for Bz < 11T on the central line in σ− polarization. D0 larger
than 4 meV would push the ±1 spin states at high energy and leads to a PL intensity on
the central line (Sz =0) much larger than observed experimentally.

RESONANT OPTICAL CONTROL AND SPIN DYNAMICS OF AN ISO-

LATED CR ATOM.

A Cr atom presents a large spin to strain coupling particularly promising for the realization of qubits in nano-mechanical systems. For a practical use of this single spin system,
one has to be able to prepare it and probe its dynamics.

A.

Resonant optical pumping of a single Cr spin

To initialize and read-out the Cr spin, we developed a two wavelengths pump-probe
experiment. A circularly polarized single mode laser (resonant pump) tuned on a X-Cr level
is used to pump the Cr spin (i.e. empty the Cr spin state under resonant excitation). Then,
a second laser, tuned on an excited state of the QD (quasi-resonant probe), injects excitons
independently of the Cr spin Sz and drives the Cr to an effective spin temperature where
the three ground states Sz =0,±1 are populated15 . By recording the PL of a X-Cr lines in
circular polarization under this periodic sequence of excitation, we can monitor the time
evolution of the population of a given Cr spin state (see Figure9 for the configuration of the
excitation and detection).
The main features of the optical pumping experiment performed on a neutral QD (QD3
in Figure9) are presented in Figure 10(a). The QD is excited on the high energy state of XCr with σ− photons (X-Cr state |Sz = −1, −1i). This excitation can only create an exciton
in the dot if the Cr spin is Sz =-1. An absorption followed by possible spin-flips of the Cr
in the exchange field of the exciton progressively decreases the population of Sz =-1. After
this pumping sequence, the resonant pump is switched off and followed by the non-resonant
probe.
A clear signature of the optical pumping appears in the time evolution of the PL intensity
of the low energy bright exciton line (4). The PL of this line during the probe pulse, recorded
in opposite circular polarization with the resonant pump, depends on the population of Sz =-

1. It strongly differs between the two pump-probe sequences where the resonant pump is on
or off. The difference of intensity at the beginning of the probe pulse is a measurement of the
efficiency of the pumping. The PL intensity transient during the probe pulse corresponds
to a destruction of the non-equilibrium population distribution prepared by the pump. The
speed of this spin heating process depends on the intensity of the probe laser. As expected
for an increase of the Cr spin temperature, the population of the ground spin state Sz =0
also decreases during the probe pulse. This decrease directly appears in the time evolution
of the amplitude of the central X-Cr lines during the probe pulse (Detection of line (3) in
Figure 10(a)). The increase of the population of Sz =0 during the probe pulse shows that the

24

population of Sz =-1 has been partially transferred to Sz =0 during the resonant pumping
sequence.

dependence of resonant PL intensity (I1 , at the beginning and I2 , at the end of the pump pulse)
and of the corresponding normalized amplitude of pumping transient (I1 -I2 )/I2 .

A more direct way to probe the optical pumping speed and efficiency is to monitor the
time evolution of the PL during the resonant excitation by the pump pulse. Under resonant
excitation on the high energy X-Cr line, an exciton spin-flip with conservation of the Cr
spin can produce a PL on the low energy line6 . In this process, the exciton flips its spin by
25

emitting (or absorbing) an acoustic phonon. Such spin-flip is enhanced by the large acoustic
phonon density of states at the energy of the inter-level splitting induced by the exchange
interaction with the Cr spin which act as an effective magnetic field45,46 . The resulting weak
resonant PL signal depends on the occupation of the Cr state Sz =-1 and is used to monitor
the time dependence of the spin selective absorption of the QD.
The time evolution of the PL of the low energy line of X-Cr (line (4)) under an excitation on the high energy line (1) is presented in Figure 10(a) for two different pump-probe
sequences: probe on and probe off. When the probe laser is on, a large effective Cr spin
temperature is established before each pumping pulse. The amplitude of the resonant PL is
maximum at the beginning of the pump pulse (I1 ) and progressively decreases. A decrease
of the amplitude of about 80% is observed after a characteristic time in the tens of ns range.
As expected for a spin optical pumping process, the characteristic time of the PL transient
decreases with the increase of the pump laser intensity (Figure 10(b))6 . When the probe
laser is off, the initial amplitude of the PL transient during the pump pulse is significantly
weaker. This decrease is a consequence of the conservation of the out of equilibrium Cr spin
distribution during the dark time between two consecutive pumping pulses.
The steady state resonant PL intensity reached at the end of the pump pulse (I2 ) depends
on the optical pumping efficiency which is controlled by the ratio of the spin-flip rate for the
Cr spin in the exchange field of the exciton and the relaxation of the Cr spin in the absence
of carriers in the dot. However, even with cross-circularly polarized excitation/detection,
this steady state PL can also contain a weak contribution from an absorption in the acoustic
phonon sideband of the low energy line (4)53 . Figure 10(c) presents the amplitude of the
resonant PL detected on line (4) for a detuning of the pump around the high energy line
(1). A resonance is observed in the initial amplitude I1 of the PL. It reflects the energy
and excitation power dependence of the absorption of the QD. A small decrease of the
steady state PL I2 is also observed at the resonance. As displayed in Figure 10(d), the
corresponding normalized amplitude of the pumping transient, (I1 − I2 )/I2 , presents a clear
resonant behavior demonstrating the excitation energy dependence of the optical pumping
process. The width of the resonance (∼ 100µeV ) is the width of the QD’s absorption
broadened by the fluctuating environment48 .

26

B.

Cr spin relaxation in the dark

With this resonant optical pumping technique used to prepare and read-out the Cr spin,
we performed pump-probe experiments to observe its relaxation time in the absence of
carriers (Figure 11). A non-equilibrium distribution of the Cr spin population is prepared
with a circularly polarized resonant pump pulse on the high energy X-Cr line (1). The pump
laser is then switched off, and switched on again after a dark time τdark . The amplitude of
the pumping transient observed on the resonant PL of the low energy line (4) depends on the
Cr spin relaxation during τdark . As presented in Figure 11(b), the amplitude of the transient
is fully restored after a dark time of about 10 µs showing that after this delay the Cr spin is
in equilibrium with the lattice temperature (T=5K). Let us note, however, that the initial
amplitude of the pumping transient in this case is weaker than the one observed after a nonresonant probe pulse (Figure 11(a)). This means that the non-resonant optical excitation
drives the Cr spin to an effective temperature much larger than the lattice temperature.
These measurements reveal a significantly different Cr spin-flip times under optical excitation (tens of nanosecond range) and in the dark (microseconds range). The fast Cr spin-flip
under optical excitation can be due to the interaction with carriers (exchange induced Cr spin
flips49 ) but can also be induced by the interaction with non-equilibrium acoustic phonons
created during the energy relaxation of the injected carriers. Both mechanisms probably
contribute to the Cr spin heating.

C.

Dynamics under optical excitation and mechanism of optical pumping for a Cr

spin

In order to identify the main mechanism responsible for the optical pumping, we analyzed
the PL intensity distribution under resonant excitation52 . We have seen that under circularly
polarized resonant excitation of the high energy X-Cr line (1), a weak PL is observed in crosscircular polarization on the low energy bright exciton line (4) after a spin-flip of the exciton
conserving the Cr spin. In this experimental configuration the same spin state of the Cr is
excited and detected (see the energy level diagram presented in Figure 9(a)). The intensity
transient observed during the resonant PL directly reflects the pumping of the Cr spin state
under excitation (either Sz = +1 or Sz = −1).

transient (I1 − I2 )/I2 as a function of the dark time τdark between the excitation pulses. The black
line is an exponential evolution with a characteristic time τCr = 1.7µs

However, as presented in Figure12(a), during this resonant pumping process a luminescence is also observed on the central lines (2) and (3) (linearly polarized bright excitons
resulting from the mixing of |0i| ⇑h ↓e i and |0i| ⇓h ↑e i). This resonant PL presents a transient with a similar time scale and amplitude as the one detected on the low energy line (4).
The steady state level of the resonant PL detected on Sz = 0 is however much lager than
for a detection on the low energy bright exciton. This steady state PL intensity is strongly
reduced under cross linearly polarized excitation and detection (figure 12(b)).
The central line (2) and (3) are linearly polarized along two orthogonal directions. For a

circularly polarized excitation on the high energy side of these transitions and for a crosscircularly polarized detection, a weak absorption in the acoustic phonon sideband53 is expected to induce some resonant PL. However, the presence of the intensity transient due
to the pumping of the resonantly excited spin states Sz = ±1 shows that there is also
an efficient population transfer between the high energy bright excitons (| + 1i| ⇑h ↓e i or
29

| − 1i| ⇓h ↑e i) created during the resonant optical excitation and the lower energy bright
exciton states (|0i| ⇓h ↑e i or |0i| ⇑h ↓e i).
For a cross-linearly polarized excitation and detection, the absorption in the acoustic
phonon side-band is strongly reduced. The pumping transient resulting from an absorption
on the states Sz = ±1 and a transfer toward Sz = 0 dominates the resonant PL. This spinflip transfer is confirmed by the excitation energy and power dependence of the resonant PL
signal. The PL intensity on line (3) presents a resonant behavior when scanning the pump
laser around the high energy line (1) (Figure 12(c)). As expected for an optical pumping
process, the time scale of the PL transient is also significantly reduced with the increase of
the excitation intensity (Figure 12(d))).
This efficient transfer towards Sz = 0 during the resonant optical pumping process is
also observed in the evolution of the PL intensity during the non-resonant probe (heating)
pulse. As expected after a resonant pumping of the spin states Sz = ±1, their population
re-increase during the non-resonant heating pulse. Simultaneously, a significant decrease of
the intensity of the line (3) is observed both for a circularly or a linearly polarized detection
(figure 12(a) and (b)). This decrease corresponds to a decrease of the population of Sz =0
during the heating process showing that a significant part of the Cr spin population has
been transferred to Sz =0 during the resonant optical pumping.
A fast hole-Cr flip-flop can explain an efficient transfer of population from the excitonCr levels Sz = ±1 towards the low energy states Sz = 0. The proposed relaxation path
is illustrated in the energy level scheme presented in figure 13 which displays the possible
relaxation channels involving a hole-Cr flip-flop for an initial excitation of the bright excitons
coupled with Sz = ±1.
Starting from the low energy bright excitons | + 1i| ⇓h ↑e i or | − 1i| ⇑h ↓e i, a hole-Cr flipflop with conservation of the electron spin can directly transfer the population towards the
dark excitons associated with Sz = 0 with a spin flip time τhCr2 . With the same mechanism,
a direct transfer is possible from the low energy dark excitons | + 1i| ⇓h ↓e i or | − 1i| ⇑h ↑e i,
to the bright excitons associated with Sz = 0 with a spin flip time τhCr1 (See figure 13).
Starting from the high energy bright excitons | + 1i| ⇑h ↓e i or | − 1i| ⇓h ↑e i, a hole-Cr flipflop is unlikely as it would involve a transfer toward the high energy Cr spin states Sz = ±2.
However, a spin flip of the hole with characteristic time τh conserving the spin of the Cr can
induce a transfer to the low energy dark excitons | + 1i| ⇓h ↓e i or | − 1i| ⇑h ↑e i. Such spin-flip

from a bright to a dark exciton can occur in QDs in a time-scale of a few nanoseconds49 .
A hole-Cr flip-flop in a timescale τhCr1 can then transfer the population from these dark
excitons to the Sz =0 bright exciton which then recombines optically (See figure 13).
From the hight energy dark excitons | + 1i| ⇑h ↑e i or | − 1i| ⇓h ↓e i a hole-Cr flip-flop is also
unlikely (transfer toward the high energy Cr spin states Sz = ±2). However these states
are coupled by a hole spin-flip to the nearby low energy bright excitons | + 1i| ⇓h ↑e i or
| − 1i| ⇑h ↓e i and can then follow this path to be transferred towards Sz = 0.
The spin relaxation channels involving a transfer from the dark exciton with Sz = ±1 to
the lower energy bright excitons Sz = 0 are made irreversible by the fast (≈ 250 ps) radiative
recombination of the final low energy exciton state. This unusual situation with some of
the bright excitons at lower energy than the dark ones can induce an out of equilibrium
31

distribution on the Cr spin states with an enhanced population of the Sz =0 ground state.
The transfer mechanism involving a hole-Cr flip-flop is enhanced by the increase of the
probability of presence of an exciton in the QD. This can be observed in the excitation
power dependence of the distribution of the non-resonant PL intensity52 .
Under resonant excitation on the hight energy levels of X-Cr (line (1)), a spin flip of
the hole followed by a fast hole-Cr flip-flops can explain the observed transfer of excitation
toward the bright excitons associated with Sz = 0. This process which efficiently changes the
Cr spin is the likely to be the main source for the resonant optical pumping demonstrated
in Cr-doped QDs50 .

D.

Phonon induced hole-Cr flip-flops

The time-scale of the hole-Cr flip-flops in a Cr-doped QD induced by the interaction
with the continuum of bulk acoustic phonons can be estimated using the Fermi golden rule.
The spin-flip process that we consider here is based on the interplay of the hole-magnetic
atom exchange interaction and the interaction with the strain field of acoustic phonons51 .
Similar models, combining exchange interaction and coupling with acoustic phonons, where
developed to explain the exciton spin relaxation in QDs45,46 .
Let us consider the two X-Cr states | + 1i| ⇓h ; ↓e i and |0i| ⇑h ; ↓e i that can be coupled
via a hole-Cr flip-flop. The non-diagonal terms of the hole-Cr exchange interaction couples
the heavy-holes and light-holes excitons levels separated in energy by ∆lh through a hole-Cr
flip-flop. To the first order in IhCr /∆lh , the two perturbed heavy-hole exciton ground states
can be written:

positively charged Mn-doped QDs, the decay rate associated with the emission of phonons

where the summation is taken over the acoustic phonon branches λ (one longitudinal l and
two transverse t1 , t2 )) of corresponding sound velocity cλ . The geometrical form factors
for each phonon branch appearing in (20), Gλ (θ), are given by Gl (θ) = sin4 θ, Gt1 (θ) =
sin2 θ cos2 θ and Gt2 (θ) = sin2 θ.
Numerical calculation of the hole-Cr spin-flip time in a CdTe QD are presented in figure
14. We used in the calculation a Gaussian wave function for the hole with in-plane and
z-direction parameters l⊥ and lz respectively, the material parameters of CdTe and typical
parameters of self-assembled CdTe/ZnTe QDs listed in table III.
The calculated spin relaxation time strongly depends on the energy splitting between the
X-Cr states involved in the hole-Cr flip-flops (figure 14(a)). This dependence on the high
energy side is controlled by the size of the hole wave function which limits the wave vector
of the acoustic phonons that can interact with the hole. The calculated spin-flip time can be
in the nanosecond range for an energy splitting between 0.5 meV and 2 meV. In the studied
Cr-doped QDs, the splitting between the low energy dark excitons states | + 1i| ⇓h ↓e i or
| − 1i| ⇑h ↑e i and the bright excitons with Sz = 0, which are coupled by a hole-Cr flip-flop,
is typically in the 1 meV range. A spin-flip time of a few ns can then be expected.
For the low energy bright excitons |+1i| ⇓h ↑e i or |−1i| ⇑h ↓e i and the dark excitons states
with Sz = 0 also coupled by hole-Cr flip-flops, their energy splitting is larger than 3 meV

and the spin-flip rates are expected to be significantly reduced. For the high energy Cr spins
states, Sz = ±2, the energy splitting is typically larger than 10 meV and the corresponding
flip-flops induced by the discussed mechanism can be neglected.
The estimated hole-Cr flip-flop time is also strongly sensitive to the effective energy
splitting between heavy-hole and light-hole ∆lh . This simple parameter is used in our model
for an effective description of the valence band mixing. It can describe complex effects such
as a coupling of the confined heavy-hole with ground state light-holes in the barriers55 or
effective reduction of heavy-hole/light-hole splitting due to a presence of a dense manifold
of heavy-hole like QD states lying between the confined heavy-hole and light-hole levels56 .
This parameter can significantly change from dot to dot and modify the hole-Cr flip-flop
time.
The calculated hole-Cr flip-flop rate also depends on the temperature through the stimulated emission of acoustic phonons. For an energy splitting of 1 meV the spin flip rate
involving the emission of phonons is increased by a factor of about four by increasing the

temperature from 5K to 50K (figure 14(b)). Such enhancement of the hole-Cr spin-flip rate
can not only be induced by an increase of the lattice temperature but also, as in our experiments, by the presence of non-equilibrium phonons that are generated by the optical
excitation inside or in the vicinity of the QD.
This calculated short flip-flop time in the ns range, is consistent with the initialization
time measured in resonant optical pumping experiments and controls the spin dynamics
under resonant excitation.

E.

Optical Stark effect on an individual Cr spin

The resonant optical excitation on a X-Cr line can also be used to tune the energy of any
Cr spin state through the optical Stark effect7,57,58 . Such energy shift could be exploited to
control the coherent dynamics of the magnetic atom12,27 . This optical control technique is
presented in Figure 15. When a high intensity single mode laser is tuned to the high energy
line of X-Cr in σ+ polarization (X-Cr state |Sz = −1, +1i), a splitting is observed in σ−
polarization in the PL of the two low energy lines produced by a second non-resonant laser.

35

At high excitation intensity, a strong coupling with the resonant laser field mixes the
states with a Cr spin component Sz =-1 in the presence (X-Cr) or absence (Cr alone) of the
exciton. In the ground state of the QD (Cr alone) two hybrid matter-field states are created
p
(inset of Figure 15(a)). Their splitting, h̄Ω0r = h̄ Ω2r + δ 2 , depends on the energy detuning
of the laser h̄δ and on its intensity through the Rabi energy h̄Ωr 59 . It can be observed in
the PL of all the X-Cr states associated with Sz =-1: the low energy bright exciton state
|Sz = −1, −1i (line (4)) and the dark exciton |Sz = −1, +2i (line (5)), close in energy to
the bright exciton and which acquires some oscillator strength through the exciton mixing
induced by the electron-hole exchange interaction in a low symmetry QD15 .
The splitting measured on line (5) for a resonant excitation on line (1) is plotted as a
function of the square root of the resonant laser intensity in Figure 15(c) and shows that,
as expected for a two level system, it linearly depends on the laser field strength. The
Rabi splitting can reach 150 µeV at high excitation power. As the pump laser is detuned,
the optically active transitions asymptotically approaches the original excitonic transitions
where the remaining offset is the optical Stark shift.
A resonant laser permits to address any spin state of the Cr and selectively shift its energy.
For instance, as presented in Figure 15(d), a σ+ excitation on the dark exciton state (5)
induces a splitting of the high energy line (1) in σ- polarization (state |Sz = +1, −1i) without
affecting the central line (2). This shows that such resonant excitation can be used to tune
the energy of Sz =+1 without affecting Sz =0. The energy tuning induced by a coherent
optical driving is particularly interesting for the control of the Cr spin states Sz =±1. These
states could be efficiently mixed by applied weak anisotropic in-plane strain through a fine
structure term of the form E(Sx2 − Sy2 )15 . A relative shift of the energy of Sz =+1 or Sz =-1
by a resonant optical excitation would affect their coupling and consequently the Cr spin
coherent dynamics.
Future applications of Cr as a spin qubit in hybrid nano-mechanical systems17,63 will
exploit the efficient mixing of the Cr spin states Sz =+1 and Sz =-1 induced by anisotropic
in-plane strain. The resulting mixed spin states, together with an exciton, form an optical
three level Λ system. A coherent optical driving of this level structure opens the possibility of
using coherent spectroscopy techniques such as coherent population trapping60 for a sensitive
probing of the splitting of the Sz =+1 and Sz =-1 induced by the local strain at the atom
location. The strain field that could be probed with this technique will depend on the
36

coherence time of the Cr {+1; −1} spin qubit.

V.

PERSPECTIVES: A CR ATOM AS A SPIN QUBIT IN HYBRID SPIN-

MECHANICAL SYSTEMS.

It has been shown recently that an individual spin can be used as a qubit to interact with
the motion of a nano-mechanical oscillator and probe its position, cool it down or prepare
non-classical state of the mechanical motion21 . It has been also demonstrated theoretically
that the coupling of two or more localized spins with the same mode of a mechanical oscillator
could be used to induce long range coherent coupling between spins61 , a usually difficult task
to achieve with spins in solid state systems. Among mechanical systems, Surface Acoustic
Wave (SAW) i.e. phonons propagating at the surface of a solid, are particularly promising.
SAW can coherently propagate over long distances at the surface of a solid state device, they
can be guided or confined in acoustic wave-guide or acoustic cavities and they can interact
with different kinds of qubits. They are in particular proposed as efficient quantum bus
between dissimilar qubits24,64 . In the case of spin qubits, the performance of SAW based
nano-mechanical devices will be enhanced by the use of localized spins with large intrinsic
spin to strain couplings. Cr is in that sense particularly promising. As we have seen in
section 2.1, in-plane strain oriented along the [110] direction (xy ) will be strongly coupled
to the spin degree of freedom of a Cr.
Large in-plane dynamical strains at a precisely defined frequency can be generated by
propagating SAW and SAW device technology also offers simple approach for fabricating
high quality factor mechanical resonators. Following the model presented in ref.24 , the
strain profile for a SAW propagating along the [110] direction of a zinc-blend material can
be calculated analytically. The strain profile for a SAW in the GHz range propagating in
the surface of ZnTe along [110] (X direction) is presented in Figure 16. Large oscillating
in-plane strain XX oriented along the direction of propagation of the SAW can be obtained
near the surface of the sample. This strain field can be used to interact with a Cr spin
located at less than 100 nm from the surface. SAW also produce close to the surface a Z
component of the strain that modifies the static magnetic anisotropy already present for a
Cr in a CdTE/ZnTe QD.
To generate SAW on a Cr-doped QD, inter-digitated transducer (IDT) can be used to
37

convert a radio-frequency signal into a mechanical motion at a well defined frequency through
the inverse piezoelectric effect. The electromechanical coupling in an IDT depends on the
square of the piezoelectric coefficients eij . Compared to GaAs where SAW propagating along
[110] direction can be directly generated with an IDT, ZnTe has a very weak piezo-electric
coefficient e14 ≈ 0.03Cm−2 . A layer of a piezo-electric material, like hexagonal ZnO with its
c axis perpendicular to the sample surface, can be used to enhance the electromechanical
coupling and the performances of the transducer62 .
In the presence of an oscillating in-plane strain field along the [110] direction, xy = ⊥ ,
the non-diagonal coupling term of the spin to strain Hamiltonian (7) for Cr becomes:

HCr,ε⊥ = 2c4 ε⊥

π
π
d⊥
1 2
(S+ − S−2 ) = − ε⊥ (ei 2 S+2 + e−i 2 S−2 )
2i
2

(21)

and the complete spin to strain Hamiltonian of Cr simplifies to

HCr,ε = (D0 + dk εk )Sz2 −

π
π
d⊥
ε⊥ (ei 2 S+2 + e−i 2 S−2 )
2

(22)

where we defined the parallel dk and perpendicular d⊥ spin to strain susceptibility. A value
of d⊥ /2 ≈ 5meV can be expected for a Cr atom in CdTe, at least two orders of magnitude
larger than for NV centers in diamond where d⊥ /2 ≈ 40µeV has been reported63 .
For small displacements, the strain is linear and we can quantize the perpendicular strain
field ε⊥ . The corresponding strain coupling Hamiltonian takes the general form:

H⊥ = −h̄γ0⊥ (a + a† )(S+2 + S−2 )

(23)

where γ0⊥ is the transverse single phonon strain coupling strength and a† (a) the raising
(lowering) operators for phonons.
In the situation where the coupling strength between the qubit and the mechanical oscillator is much smaller than the qubit and oscillator frequency, it is a good approximation to
drop the counter rotating terms. This is the standard rotating wave approximation and the
interacting Hamiltonian takes the form:

H⊥ = −h̄γ0⊥ (aS+2 + a† S−2 )
38

(24)

For Cr in a strained QD where the spin states Sz = 0, Sz = ±1 and Sz = ±2 are split by a
large magnetic anisotropy D0 , we can focus on the two-level spin subspace {|+1i, |−1i} only
and assume that mechanically induced transitions to state |0i or | ± 2i are not allowed due
to the large zero field splitting (see Figure 17). For a given spin, we write Pauli operators
σ ± = | ± 1ih∓1| and σ z = |1ih1| − | − 1ih−1|. Within this two-level subspace and within the
rotating wave approximation, the interaction for a single spin with the strain field takes on
the generic Jaynes-Cummings form

Hi =

∆B z
σ + h̄g0 (σ + a + a† σ−) + h̄ωm a† a
2

(25)

where a magnetic field parallel to the z axis has been introduced to split the Sz = ±1 Cr
spin levels by ∆B = 2gCr µB Bz (with gCr ≈ 2.0). This magnetic field allows to adjust the
energy of the spin qubit to the energy of a phonon of the SAW mode h̄ωm . Under this usual
description common to many qubit systems, the dynamics of the +1, −1 Cr spin qubit can
be obtained in closed-form.
For a coherent phonon field at frequency ωm /2π (typically the one produced by a propagating SAW) tuned on resonance with the transition between the ±1 spin states, the spin
to strain coupling can be rewritten

HStr,⊥ = h̄Ωm cos(ωm t)(S+2 + S−2 )

(26)

Where h̄Ωm , the Raby energy, describes the amplitude of the strain drive. Dynamical
anisotropic in-plane strain provided by the SAW24 could then be used for a direct coherent
control of the {+1; −1} spin qubit under longitudinal magnetic field18 . Such mechanical
coherent control could be probed with the resonant optical pumping technique presented in
the previous sections.
At high SAW excitation or in a SAW cavity, the large spin to strain coupling of Cr
should permit to obtain a Rabi energy of the order of magnitude of the qubit energy. In
this coupling regime, called the strong driving regime, the rotating wave approximation is
no longer valid and the response of the two-level system to the driving field is the source of
many interesting phenomena which have not been studied in details until now.
SAW pulses (typically in the hundred ns range), could be used for a mechanical determination of the dynamical spin to strain coupling and the coherence time of the +1, −1 spin
39

qubit. This will permit to determine the coupling regime that could be reached between
a SAW cavity and a Cr spin. In particular, the strong coupling regime could probably be
reached for an ensemble of individual Cr spins and the fundamental mode of a SAW cavity.
For a detuned cavity and two distinct Cr-doped QDs coupled to the same phonon mode
of a SAW cavity, the mechanical motion can be used to induce a long distance spin-spin
coupling61 .

VI.

CONCLUSION

We demonstrated that the spin of a Cr atom in a semiconductor can be probed and
controlled optically. In self-assembled QDs, the fine structure of the atom is dominated by
a large magnetic anisotropy induced by bi-axial strain in the plane of the QDs. Resonant
optical excitation can be used to control the spin of the atom. The Cr spin can be initialized
by optical pumping, readout through the resonant PL of the QD and the energy of any
spin state can tuned by the optical Stark effect. The spin relaxation of the Cr atom in the
absence of optical excitation remains in the µs range at low temperature. The relaxation of
a Cr spin in the exchange field of an exciton is however much faster and dominated by spin
flips induced by an interplay of the hole-Cr exchange interaction and the interaction with
acoustic phonons. The presence of these hole-Cr flip-flops taking place in a few ns explains
the efficient optical pumping observed under resonant excitation.
The Sz = ±1 spin states of the Cr can form a spin qubit with a large spin to strain coupling. The possible optical control makes Cr a promising platform to study the interaction
of the +1, −1 spin qubit with SAW which are proposed as efficient quantum bus between
different kinds of qubits.

FIG. 15: (a) PL of X-Cr and configuration of excitation in the resonant optical control experiments.
The inset illustrate the laser induced splittings in the ground and excited states for a σ+ excitation
on Sz =-1. (b) PL intensity maps of lines (5) and (4) for an excitation on (1) as a function of the
detuning (top) and of the excitation intensity (bottom). The PL is produced by a second nonresonant laser. The corresponding emission line-shapes are presented in (c) for line (5). The insets
in (c) show the splitting of the PL doublet as a function of the excitation intensity (bottom) and
laser detuning (top). The fit is obtained with h̄Ωr = 100 µeV . (d) PL of line (1) and (2) for a laser
on resonance with the dark exciton state (5). Inset: PL intensity map of line (1) as a function of
the laser detuning around (5).
