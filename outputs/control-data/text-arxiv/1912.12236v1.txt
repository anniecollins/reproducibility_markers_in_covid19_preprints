INTRODUCTION

We analyze the behavior of a non-relativistic particle, e.g. an ultra-cold neutron, in a homogenous gravitational
field and confined between two independently harmonically vibrating mirrors, which constitutes a novel generalization
of the qBOUNCE experiment. While the qBOUNCE setup consists of either one reflecting mirror or two mirrors with
constant separation, we analyze here the generalized case with the two mirrors vibrating independently. This adds
another layer of complexity in the theoretical description with respect to the former setup. In fact, the qBOUNCE
experiment constitutes a realization of a quantum mechanical system with time-dependent boundary conditions [1–7].
Already in 1949 Fermi [8] proposed a mechanism for the production of cosmic rays in which particles move in
inhomogeneous magnetic fields. He proposed no specific model but provided some estimates on contemporary data.
Later on, Ulam [9] introduced the ”Fermi-accelerator” in which a classical ball bounces back and forth between two
oscillating walls. His numerical studies showed regular as well as stochastic motion and since then have become a
paradigmatic model in chaos studies [3, 10–12]. Soon thereafter the quantum mechanical version emerged in the area
of quantum chaos. Another line of studies concerning this quantum mechanical system involves non-locality induced
by the moving wall on a localized state [13–20] (for a recent disproof of this conjecture see [21].) Still another context
of this system concerns chirped frequency excitations of quantum states, which were proposed in [22]. As it turns
out, the resolution of the Schrödinger equation for an arbitrary time dependent Hamiltonian is a formidable task and
beset with conceptual issues.
In this paper we consider the theoretical analysis of such a generalized setup. Our main focus are quantum states
of a neutron in Earth’s gravitational potential, which have been observed in 2002 [23] and consecutively in [24–
31]. A theoretical description can be found in [32, 33]. The energy eigenstates are discrete and allow to perform
precision measurements with a method of resonance spectroscopy as realized by the qBOUNCE experiment [28]. In
the version of the experiment with Rabi-spectroscopy an energy resolution of 2×10−15 peV has been achieved [30].
The experiment was performed in such a way, that ultra-cold neutrons pass three regions, while being reflected on
polished glass mirrors. In [30], the resonance spectroscopy transitions between the energy ground state E1 = 1.407
peV and the excited states E3 = 3.321 peV as well as E4 = 4.083 peV have been demonstrated. First, the neutrons
pass region I which acts as a state selector for the ground state |1i having energy E1 . A polished mirror at the bottom
and a rough absorbing scatterer on top at a height of about 20 µm serve to select the ground state. Neutrons in
higher, unwanted states are scattered out of the system. This region has a length of 15 cm. Subsequently, in region
II, a horizontal mirror performs harmonic oscillations with a tunable frequency ω, which drives the system into a
coherent superposition of ground and excited states. The length of this region is 20 cm. Finally, region III is identical
to the first region and hence acts again as a ground state selector.
The qBOUNCE experiment, has been employed in the search for new physics, i.e. axions and axion-like particles
which are candidates of dark matter [29], chameleons and symmetrons which are prominent candidates for screened
dark energy [30, 34–36] and Lorentz violation [37]. In this work, we consider the behavior of a neutron, or more
generally a non-relativistic particle in only a single region of the qBOUNCE experiment but with the second mirror
now vibrating independently of the first. At least what concerns the theoretical analysis this leads to a highly
non-trivial extension of the previous case.
In section II the analysis for a particle confined by two independently vibrating mirrors in a gravitational field is
detailed, i.e. the corresponding potential operator for the Schrödinger equation is derived. Section III provides an

approximation for the typical case of small mirror vibration amplitudes compared to the mirror separation. Then,
section IV provides the quantum mechanical description of the system under study, while our results are summarized
in section V. In Appendices A and B analytical details relevant for our investigation are presented.

SCHRÖDINGER EQUATION FOR THE NEUTRON IN THE GRAVITATIONAL FIELD

The quantum-mechanical description of an ultra-cold neutron above a mirror in the gravitational potential is given
by the Schrödinger equation [38, 39]. After separation into free transversal and due to gravitation and mirror in

obtained by the conditions that the wavefunctions vanish at the lower as well as upper mirror surface, i.e.

For a mirror displacement of e.g. L = 28 µm, which is typical of the qBOUNCE experiment, the first six eigenvalues

A.

One Vibrating Mirror

Here, we consider the effect of a single vibrating lower mirror on the particle. Such a configuration has been
experimentally realized in region II of the Rabi-spectroscopy version of the qBOUNCE experiment. It will be described
via a transition to the non-inertial frame of the moving mirror.
Throughout this section, we denote the coordinates of the inertial frame as (z0 , t0 ) and the wavefunction as ψ(z0 , t0 ).
In the non-inertial frame in which the lower mirror is at rest we have coordinates (z̃, t̃) for which z0 = z̃ + a sin ω t̃.
Here, a is the amplitude of vibration of the lower mirror and ω the corresponding vibration frequency.
The transition to this non-inertial frame can be described by the transformation (z0 , t0 ) −→ (z̃, t̃) and ψ(z0 , t0 ) =
ψ(z0 (z̃, t̃), t0 (z̃, t̃)) ≡ ψ̃(z̃, t̃) with
t̃ = t0 ,

z̃ = z0 − a sin ωt0 ,

Addition of a Second Independently Vibrating Mirror

Next, we consider the addition of a second upper mirror vibrating independently. Such a configuration has not yet
been realized in an experimental setup. For the analytical description of the time-dependent mirror separation we
follow the procedure in [5], which allows to translate the time-dependence of the mirror separation into a potential
operator. Effectively, the problem is thereby reduced to a particle in a homogenous gravitational field confined by
two static mirrors.
The position of the upper mirror in the inertial frame shall be given by z0M = L + A sin(Ωt0 + ϕ) and in the
non-inertial frame by z̃ M = L + A sin(Ωt̃ + ϕ) − a sin ω t̃ =: χ̃(t̃/T )L with the dimensionless factor
χ̃(t̃/T ) := 1 +

a

sin(Ωt̃ + ϕ) − sin ω t̃ .

(17)

Here, a denotes again the amplitude of vibration of the lower mirror, while A is the amplitude of vibration of the
upper mirror, ω is the vibration frequency of the lower mirror and Ω the corresponding vibration frequency of the
upper mirror, L the distance between lower and upper mirror at their respective average position, ϕ the phase advance
of the upper mirror with respect to the lower mirror at t̃ = 0 and T a unit of time. Following [5], we introduce the
transformed coordinates

Next, we define
χ(t/T ) := χ̃(t̃/T ) ,
ψ(z, t) := ψ̃(z̃, t̃) .

(19)

The inverse transformations are clearly given by
z̃ = χ(t/T ) z ,

where a prime ′ denotes a derivative with respect to the argument. The result of this procedure is that the boundary
conditions due to the two vibrating mirrors become those of two static walls with separation L in the new ”unbarred”
coordinates. Hence, the time dependence of the boundary conditions has been transformed into an additional potential
operator in the Schrödinger equation.
In transformed coordinates the Schrödinger equation Eq. (15) takes the form

QUANTUM MECHANICAL DESCRIPTION OF THE SYSTEM

The potential operators describing the independent vibrations of both mirrors in the perturbative approximation,
as given in section III, are amenable to a standard quantum-mechanical perturbative treatment (see e.g. [41]). For
the wavefunction we write

Ψ(z, t) =
ak (t) ψk (z, t) ,
(40)

8

where ψk (z, t) are the eigenfunctions of the unperturbed problem, i.e. for a particle in a homogenous gravitational
field and confined by two static mirrors as given in Eq. (10). Using the orthogonality of the unperturbed wavefunctions,
we find

can be evaluated analytically exact. We refrain from reproducing the complicated expressions here, since this can
be straightforwardly done by employing the explicit expressions for the potential operator, i.e. Eqs. (38) and (39),
in Eq. (42). The spatial integration of the corresponding operators z, ∂/∂z and z ∂/∂z between two eigenfunctions
are derived in detail in the Appendices with the relevant results given in Eqs. (B11), (B13), (B15), (B17), (B19) and

CONCLUSION

We have analyzed the behavior of a non-relativistic particle, e.g. an ultra-cold neutron, in a homogenous gravitational field and confined between two independently harmonically vibrating mirrors. This constitutes a non-trivial
generalization of the qBOUNCE experiment.
In this paper we consider exclusively the theoretical analysis of such a generalized setup. In a subsequent publication,
we plan to add our observations obtained by numerical simulations of several excitation configurations of the two
vibrating mirrors.
