HOLOMORPHIC MULTIPLIER REPRESENTATIONS
FOR BOUNDED HOMOGENEOUS DOMAINS
KOICHI ARASHI

Abstract. In this paper, we study the unitarizations in the spaces
of holomorphic sections of equivariant holomorphic line bundles
over a bounded homogeneous domain under the action of a connected algebraic group acting transitively on the domain. We give
a complete classiﬁcation of unitary representations arising from
such unitarizations. As an application, we classify all such unitary representations for a speciﬁc ﬁve-dimensional non-symmetric
bounded homogeneous domain.

1. Introduction
Unitary representations realized in the spaces of the holomorphic
sections of equivariant holomorphic line bundles appear in various areas of the representation theory of Lie groups. For instance, we can
recall the Borel-Weil theory for compact Lie groups, the holomorphic
discrete series and its analytic continuation for Hermite Lie groups,
the Bargmann-Fock representation for the Heisenberg group, and the
Auslander-Kostant theory for solvable Lie groups. We shall formulate
such unitary representations as follows. Let M be a connected complex manifold, let Authol (M) be the holomorphic automorphism group
of M, let G0 ⊂ Authol (M) be a connected subgroup which acts on
M transitively, and let L be a G0 -equivariant holomorphic line bundle
over M. We denote by Γhol (L) the space of holomorphic sections of L.
Let l be the representation of G0 given by
l(g)s(z) = gs(g −1z) (g ∈ G0 , s ∈ Γhol (L), z ∈ M).
Let us consider all G0 -equivariant holomorphic line bundles L over M
and the following fundamental questions:
(Q1) What is the condition that the representation l of G0 is unitarizable?
(Q2) Which unitarizations are equivalent as unitary representations
of G0 ?

Here we make precise the class of representations we study.
Definition 1.1. We say that the representation l is unitarizable if there
exists a nonzero Hilbert space H ⊂ Γhol (L) satisfying the following
conditions:
(i) the inclusion map ι : H ֒→ Γhol (L) is continuous with respect
to the open compact topology of Γhol (L),
(ii) l(g)H ⊂ H (g ∈ G0 ) and kl(g)sk = ksk (g ∈ G0 , s ∈ H), where
k · k denotes the norm of H.
This notion is closely related to the holomorphic induction introduced
by Auslander and Kostant. We will mention the relation later. For
a unitarizable representation l, we call the subrepresentation (l, H) a
unitarization of the representation (l, Γhol (L)) of G0 .
A Hilbert space H satisfying the condition (i) is a reproducing kernel
Hilbert space. The following theorem is known.
Theorem 1.2 ([15, Theorem 6], [20], [21]). A Hilbert space giving a
unitarization of l is unique if it exists. In particular, the unitarization
is irreducible.
In this paper, we shall give a complete answer to the questions (Q1)
and (Q2) in the case that M is a bounded homogeneous domain D and
G0 ⊂ Authol (D) is the identity component G of a real algebraic group.
Here it is known [17, Theorem 3.2] that Authol (D) admits a structure
of a Lie group and its identity component is isomorphic to the identity
component of a linear algebraic group. The identity component of
Authol (D), which is denoted by Authol (D)o is an example of G. When D
is symmetric, any parabolic subgroup of Authol (D)o is also an example
of G. Now we introduce a notion of Iwasawa subgroup of a Lie group.
Definition 1.3. For a Lie group G0 , we call a subgroup B0 ⊂ G0 an
Iwasawa subgroup of G0 if B0 is a maximal connected real split solvable
Lie subgroup of G0 .
It is known that the isotropy subgroup of Authol (D)o at a point p ∈ D
is a maximal compact subgroup of Authol (D)o , and in our setting, it
follows that an Iwasawa subgroup B of G acts on D simply transitively
(see [27, Chapter 4, Theorem 4.7]).
Definition 1.4. An analytic function m : G × D → C× is called a
multiplier if the following cocycle condition is satisfied:
m(gg ′, z) = m(g, g ′z)m(g ′ , z) (g, g ′ ∈ G, z ∈ D).
Moreover, a multiplier m is called a holomorphic multiplier if m(g, z)
is holomorphic in z ∈ D.

Let m : G × D → C× be a holomorphic multiplier. Let Em be the
G-equivariant trivial line bundle D × C, where the G-action on Em is
defined by
g(z, ζ) = (gz, m(g, z)ζ).
Since a bounded homogeneous domain is a contractible Stein manifold, every holomorphic line bundle over D is trivial. Thus there exists
a holomorphic multiplier m : G × D → C× such that L and Em are
isomorphic as G-equivariant holomorphic line bundles. Let O(D) denote the space of holomorphic functions on D. We identify Γhol (Em )
with O(D), and let us denote Tm the representation l for Em . The
representation Tm of G is described as
Tm (g)f (z) = m(g −1 , z)−1 f (g −1z) (f ∈ O(D)).
The scalar-valued holomorphic discrete series and its analytic continuation is a special case of our object. In this case D is a bounded symmetric domain and G is a semisimple Lie group which is locally isomorphic to the group Authol (D). Let γ be a complex number, let D be an irreducible bounded symmetric domain, and let J : Authol (D)o ×D → C×
denote the complex Jacobian. Consider the following representation of
Authol (D)o on the space O(D):
TJ −γ (g)f (z) = J(g −1, z)γ f (g −1z) (g ∈ Authol (D)o, f ∈ O(D)).
To be precise, we should consider J(g −1 , z)γ as a function defined on
^
o
^ o
Aut
hol (D) ×D, where Authol (D) denotes the universal covering group
of Authol (D)o. The unitarizations of the above representations TJ −γ are
highest weight unitary representations, and the equivalence classes of
these unitary representations are determined by their highest weights
γ. On the other hand, not all TJ −γ are unitarizable. First we consider
^
o
the condition that TJ −γ has a nontrivial Aut
hol (D) -invariant subspace
which is given as a weighted Bergman space. The condition is a special
case of the Harish-Chandra condition [10, 11]. More generally, the set
of γ for which TJ −γ is unitarizable is called the Wallach set of D, and
is determined by Vergne and Rossi [32] and Wallach [34].
We can consider the same kind of representations for bounded homogeneous domains. Let D be a (not necessarily symmetric) bounded
homogeneous domain. Ishi shows the following theorem.
Theorem 1.5 (Ishi, [15, Proposition 14]). Let H ⊂ O(D) be a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Suppose that TJ −γ (b)H ⊂ H for all b ∈ B,
and kTJ −γ (b)f k = kf k for all b ∈ B and f ∈ O(D). Then we have

TJ −γ (g)H ⊂ H for all g ∈ Aut
hol (D), and kTJ −γ (g)f k = kf k for all

hol (D) and f ∈ O(D).
Theorem 1.6 (Ishi, [16]). Unitarizations of TJ −γ and TJ −γ′ are equiv′
o
^
alent as unitary representations of Aut
hol (D) if and only if γ = γ .
When D is an irreducible bounded symmetric domain, every Authol (D)o equivariant holomorphic line bundle over D is isomorphic to EJ −γ for
some γ ∈ C. On the other hand, for G ( Authol (D)o , it can happen
that there exists a G-equivariant holomorphic line bundle L such that
L is not isomorphic to LJ −γ for any γ ∈ C as a G-equivariant holomorphic line bundle. Moreover, when D is not symmetric, the same can
happen even for G = Authol (D)o (see Section 6).
As we will see in Section 2, we can reduce the question (Q1) for G
to the question for B. Let D be a bounded homogeneous domain, and
let L be a G-equivariant holomorphic line bundle over D.
Theorem 1.7 (see Theorem 2.13). Let H ⊂ Γhol (L) be a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Suppose that l(b)H ⊂ H for all b ∈ B and
kl(b)sk = ksk for all b ∈ B and s ∈ Γhol (L). Then we have l(g)H ⊂ H
for all g ∈ G and kl(g)sk = ksk for all g ∈ G and s ∈ Γhol (L).
Namely, the unitarizability as the representation of B implies the one
as the representation of G.
We fix a reference point p ∈ D. Let Lp be the fiber over the point
p, and let K be the isotropy subgroup of G at p. Note that K is a
maximal compact connected subgroup of G. Concerning the question
(Q2), we obtain
Theorem 1.8 (see Theorem 5.18). Let L and L′ be G-equivariant
holomorphic line bundles over D. Suppose that H ⊂ Γhol (L) and
H′ ⊂ Γhol (L′ ) give unitarizations of representations l and l′ , respectively. Then (l, H) and (l′ , H′ ) are equivalent as unitary representations
of G if and only if (l|B , H) and (l′ |B , H′ ) are equivalent as unitary representations of B and the actions of K on the fibers Lp and L′p coincide.
Now we give a concrete parametrization of the G-equivariant holomorphic line bundles L for which the representations l are unitarizable,
and we shall give the partition of the parameter set Θ(G) which corresponds to the equivalence classes of the unitarizations. In other words,
the partition gives an answer to the question (Q2), and describes the
classification of the unitary representations of G obtained by unitarizations.

Let L be a G-equivariant holomorphic line bundle corresponding to
θ ∈ L(G). There exists a G-invariant Hermitian metric on L and we
consider the space Γ2 (L) of square integrable holomorphic sections of
L. If Γ2 (L) 6= {0}, then Γ2 (L) gives the unitarization, and (l, Γ2 (L))
is nothing else but the holomorphically induced representation in [1]
from a “polarization” g at ξ ∈ g∗ , where iξ|g− = θ (see p. 11). We
note that even though Γ2 (L) = {0}, there may exist H =
6 {0} giving
a unitarization of l. Let b = Lie(B). We identify Tp D with b. Then
a B-invariant Kähler metric on D defines a normal j-algebra (b, j, ω)
(see [9, Part III, Lemma 1]). Let a denote the orthogonal complement
of [b, b] in b with respect to the inner product h·, ·i = ω([j·, ·]) on b.
Put a− = g− ∩ aC . The set of equivalence classes of B-equivariant
holomorphic line bundles over D is parametrized by a∗− . Let r = dim a.
For ε = (ε1 , · · · , εr ) ∈ {0, 1}r , we put Z(ε) = {ζ = (ζ1 , · · · , ζr ) ∈

the same Θ(ε, ζ). Combining Theorem 1.7 and Theorem 1.8 with the
results of [12, 15], we obtain a method of giving a concrete parametrization in question. Let
Λ = {λ ∈ z(k)∗ ; iλ = dχ|z(k) for some one-dimensional representation χ of K}.
For ε ∈ {0, 1}r , ζ ∈ Z(ε), and λ ∈ Λ, we put
Θ(G, ε, ζ, λ) = {θ ∈ L(G); θ|a− ∈ Θ(ε, ζ), θ|z(k) = iλ}.

As a byproduct of the proof of Theorem 1.8, we obtain the following
theorem.

Theorem 1.9 (see Corollary 5.16). Let L and L′ be G-equivariant
holomorphic line bundles over D. Suppose that the actions of K on
the fibers Lp and L′p coincide. Then L and L′ are isomorphic as Kequivariant holomorphic line bundles.
Let us explain the organization of this paper. In Section 2, we prove
Theorem 1.7. In Section 3, we review the theory of normal j-algebras.
In Section 4, first we prove Lemma 4.7 about a property of the gradation of the Lie algebra authol (D) of Authol (D) and its bracket relations.
After that, Section 4 is devoted to the proof of Proposition 4.23, that
is a generalization of Lemma 4.7 in which authol (D) gets replaced by
g. Proposition 4.23 plays an important role in the proof of Theorem
5.15, which implies Theorem 1.9 immediately. In Section 5, we show

2. Existence of unitarizations
Throughout this paper, for a Lie group G0 , we denote its Lie algebra
by the corresponding Fraktur small letter g0 .
2.1. General theory of holomorphic multiplier representations.
We review the theory of homogeneous holomorphic vector bundles and
the theory of holomorphic multiplier representations in [15, 20, 31].
Let D0 be a domain in CN , and let G0 be a Lie group which acts
holomorphically on D0 . We assume that the action of G0 on D0 is
analytic, i.e. the map G0 × D0 ∋ (g, z) 7→ gz ∈ D0 is analytic. Let V
be a finite-dimensional complex vector space.
Definition 2.1. An analytic function m : G0 × D0 → GL(V) is called
a multiplier if the following cocycle condition is satisfied:
m(gg ′, z) = m(g, g ′z)m(g ′ , z) (g, g ′ ∈ G0 , z ∈ D0 ).
Moreover, a multiplier m is called a holomorphic multiplier if m(g, z)
is holomorphic in z ∈ D0 .
Remark 2.2. When V = C, let
G = {m : G0 × D0 → C× ; m is a holomorphic multiplier}.
Pointwise multiplication of holomorphic multipliers gives G the natural
structure of a group. We write the product of two elements m, m′ of G
as mm′ .
Let m : G0 × D0 → GL(V) be a holomorphic multiplier. Let Tm be
the representation of G0 defined by
Tm (g)f (z) = m(g −1, z)−1 f (g −1z) (g ∈ G0 , f ∈ O(D0 , V), z ∈ D0 ),
where O(D0 , V) denotes the space of vector-valued holomorphic functions on D0 . When V = C, a power of the complex Jacobian J(g, z)−γ (g ∈
G0 , z ∈ D0 , γ ∈ Z) is an example of a holomorphic multiplier. We fix a

For X ∈ g0 , let us use the same symbol X to denote the corresponding
left invariant vector field on G0 . We extend (F∗ )g to a C-linear map
for all g ∈ G0 . At the identity element e of G0 , this is a complex-linear
map (F∗ )e : (g0 )C → gl(V). Then for Z ∈ (g0 )− , we have
(F∗ Z)F (g) = θm (Z)F (g)

(g ∈ G0 ).

Thus for Z, Z ′ ∈ (g0 )− , we have
θm ([Z, Z ′ ]) = θm ([Z, Z ′ ])e = (F∗ )e [Z, Z ′ ]e = [θm (Z), θm (Z ′ )]e
= [θm (Z), θm (Z ′ )].
We see from the above equation that θm : (g0 )− → gl(V) is a complex
representation of (g0 )− . Consider the action of G0 on the trivial bundle
D0 × V given by
(2.2)

g(z, v) = (gz, m(g, z)v) (g ∈ G0 , z ∈ D0 , v ∈ V).

We denote by Em the G0 -equivariant holomorphic vector bundle D0 ×V.
Lemma 2.3 ([15, Lemma 1]). Let m, m′ : G0 × D0 → GL(V) be
holomorphic multipliers. Then Em and Em′ are isomorphic as G0 equivariant holomorphic vector bundles if and only if there exists a
matrix-valued holomorphic function f : D0 → GL(V) such that
(2.3)

m′ (g, z) = f (gz)m(g, z)f (z)−1

(g ∈ G0 , z ∈ D0 ).

Definition 2.4. We say that two holomorphic multipliers m, m′ : G0 ×
D0 → GL(V) are G0 -equivalent if they satisfy (2.3) with some matrixvalued function f .

The next theorem is fundamental for our paper. Let K0 be the
isotropy subgroup of G0 at p0 .
Theorem 2.5 ([31, Theorem 3.6]). Suppose that the group G0 acts
on D0 transitively. Let m, m′ : G0 × D0 → GL(V) be holomorphic
multipliers. Then holomorphic vector bundles Em and Em′ are isomorphic as G0 -equivariant holomorphic vector bundles if and only if
θm (Z) = θm′ (Z) for all Z ∈ (g0 )− .
From now on, we discuss the representation Tm and its unitarizations.
Definition 2.6. We say that the representation Tm is unitarizable if
there exists a nonzero Hilbert space H ⊂ O(D0 , V) satisfying the following conditions:
(i) the inclusion map ι : H ֒→ O(D0 , V) is continuous with respect
to the open compact topology of O(D0 , V),
(ii) Tm (g)H ⊂ H (g ∈ G0 ) and kTm (g)f k = kf k (g ∈ G0 , f ∈ H),
where k · k denotes the norm of H.
For a unitarizable representation Tm , we call the subrepresentation
(Tm , H) a unitarization of the representation Tm of G0 .
A Hilbert space H satisfying the condition (i) is a reproducing kernel
Hilbert space.
Remark 2.7. Let m, m′ : G0 × D0 → GL(V) be holomorphic multipliers. If m and m′ are G0 -equivalent and Tm is unitarizable, then Tm′
is also unitarizable, and the unitarizations are equivalent as unitary
representations of G0 . On the other hand, even though m and m′ are
not G0 -equivalent, the unitarizations of Tm and Tm′ can be equivalent
as unitary representations of G0 (see Section 6).
We fix a Hermitian inner product on V. Suppose that a holomorphic
multiplier representation Tm has a unitarization (Tm , H). For v ∈ V
and w ∈ D0 , let Kv,w ∈ O(D0 , V) be the function defined by
(f, Kw,v )H = (f (w), v)V

(f ∈ O(D0 , V)).

Let K : D0 × D0 → End(V) be the reproducing kernel of H defined by
K(z, w)v = Kw,v (z) (z, w ∈ D0 , v ∈ V).
Then K satisfies
(2.4)

K(gz, gw) = m(g, z)K(z, w)m(g, w)∗

(z, w ∈ D0 , g ∈ G0 ).

The next lemma shows that the converse also holds.

10

KOICHI ARASHI

Lemma 2.8 ([15, Lemma 5]). Let H ⊂ O(D0 , V) be a Hilbert space with
reproducing kernel K and let m : G0 × D0 → GL(V) be a holomorphic
multiplier. Then (Tm , H) is a unitarization of Tm if and only if (2.4)
holds.
The next theorem is also fundamental for our paper.
Theorem 2.9 ([15, Theorem 6], [20], [21]). If G0 acts on D0 transitively and the map K0 ∋ k 7→ m(k, p0 ) ∈ GL(V) defines an irreducible
representation of K0 , then a Hilbert space giving a unitarization of Tm
is unique if it exists. In particular, the unitarization is irreducible.
For any g ∈ G0 , v ∈ V and f ∈ H, we have
(f, Tm (g)K(·, p0)v) = (Tm (g −1)f, K(·, p0 )v) = (Tm (g −1)f (p0 ), v)
= (m(g, p0 )−1 f (gp0), v).
The right hand side of the above equation is a C ω -function of g ∈ G0 .
Hence K(·, p0 )v is a C ω -vector of the representation (Tm , H).
Let V = C. For X ∈ g0 and z ∈ D0 , we have

it follows that

where X + iY = X − iY for X, Y ∈ g0 . In general, for a unitary
representation (π, H0 ) of an arbitrary Lie group G0 , the moment map
J : P(H0∞ ) ∋ [v] 7→ J[v] ∈ g∗0 is defined by
J[v] (X) =

Let J : P(H∞ ) ∋ [v] 7→ J[v] ∈ g∗0 be the moment map of (Tm , H), and
we put
ξ = J[K(·,p0 )] ∈ g∗0 .

(2.6)
Then by (2.5), we have

θm (Z) = iξ(Z) (Z ∈ (g0 )− ).
2.2. The case of bounded homogeneous domains. A bounded
domain is said to be homogeneous if the holomorphic automorphism
group acts on the domain transitively. Let D ⊂ CN be a domain
which is biholomorphic to a bounded homogeneous domain. It is well
known that the holomorphic automorphism group Authol (D) of D has
a canonical structure of a Lie group from the viewpoint of the group
action.
Definition 2.10. For an arbitrary Lie group G0 , we call a maximal
connected real split solvable Lie subgroup of G0 an Iwasawa subgroup.
Let Authol (D)o be the identity component of Authol (D). It is known
[17, Theorem 3.2] that Authol (D)o is isomorphic to the identity component of a linear real algebraic Lie group. Let G be the identity
component of a real algebraic subgroup of Authol (D)o which acts on D
transitively. For any linear real algebraic group G0 , the identity component Go0 can be topologically decomposed into the direct product of
a maximal compact subgroup of G0 and an Iwasawa subgroup of G0
(see [27, Chapter 4, Theorem 4.7]). We fix a reference point p ∈ D. It
is known that the isotropy subgroup of Authol (D)o at p is a maximal
compact subgroup of Authol (D)o . The group G contains an Iwasawa
subgroup B of Authol (D)o which acts on D simply transitively, and
hence we can identify D with B. Note that the isotropy subgroup K of
G at p is connected because D is simply connected and G is connected.
In general a bounded homogeneous domain is a contractible Stein
manifold. Thus every G-equivariant holomorphic line bundle over D is
isomorphic as a G-equivariant holomorphic line bundle to Em = D × C
with some holomorphic multiplier m : G × D → C× . For p ∈ D, let
g− ⊂ gC be the complex subalgebra defined by (2.1).
Theorem 2.11 ([31, Theorem 3.6]). Let θ : g− → gl(V) be a complex
representation of g− whose restriction to k lifts to a representation of
K. Then there exists a holomorphic multiplier m : G × D → GL(V)
such that θ(Z) = θm (Z) for all Z ∈ g− .
We get the following lemma by the decomposition G = BK.

12

KOICHI ARASHI

Lemma 2.12. Let m : G × D → GL(V) be a (not necessarily holomorphic) multiplier. If a V-valued function f on D satisfies
m(k, p)f (p) = f (p) (k ∈ K)

(2.7)
and
(2.8)

f (bz) = m(b, z)f (z)

(b ∈ B, z ∈ D),

f (gz) = m(g, z)f (z)

(g ∈ G, z ∈ D).

then we have
(2.9)

Proof. We consider the G-equivariant vector bundle D × V, and regard
f as a section of the vector bundle. Then (2.8) means that the section
f is B-invariant under the action of B, and (2.9) means that the section
f is G-invariant under the action of G. Therefore, since B acts on D
transitively, (2.8) and (2.9) are equivalent.

The following proposition is just an application of the previous lemma.
Theorem 2.13. Let m : G × D → GL(V) be a holomorphic multiplier,
and let H ⊂ O(D, V) be a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We fix a
Hermitian inner product on V such that m(k, p) ∈ U(V) for all k ∈
K. Suppose that the reproducing kernel K of H satisfies K(p, p) ∈
HomK (V, V), and the representation Tm satisfies Tm (b)H ⊂ H (b ∈ B)
and kTm (b)f k = kf k (b ∈ B, f ∈ H). Then we have Tm (g)H ⊂ H (g ∈
G) and kTm (g)f k = kf k (g ∈ G, f ∈ H).
Proof. By Lemma 2.8, for all g ∈ B, we have
(2.10)

K(gz, gz) = m(g, z)K(z, z)m(g, z)∗

(z ∈ D).

Let Kd be the End(V)-valued function on D given by Kd (z) = K(z, z),
and let m̃ : G × D → GL(End(V)) be a multiplier defined by
m̃(g, z)A = m(g, z) ◦ A ◦ m(g, z)∗

(A ∈ End(V)).

Applying Lemma 2.12 to m̃ and Kd , we see that (2.10) holds for all
g ∈ G. By the analytic continuation, the equation
K(gz, gw) = m(g, z)K(z, w)m(g, w)∗
holds. This proves the result by Lemma 2.8.

(g ∈ G, z, w ∈ D)

Remark 2.14. When V = C, the condition K(p, p) ∈ HomK (V, V) in
the previous proposition holds automatically.

3. Normal j-algebras and bounded homogeneous domains
In this section, we review the theory of normal j-algebras in [4, 25,
28, 29, 9] and explain the relationship between normal j-algebras and
bounded homogeneous domains.
For X ∈ authol (D), let X # denote the vector field on D given by
Xz# =

d
dt

etX z

(z ∈ D).

t=0

We fix a B-invariant Kähler metric hh·, ·ii on D such that hhj0 X, j0 Y ii =
hhX, Y ii for all vector fields X, Y over D, where j0 denotes the complex
structure on D induced from the one of CN . For example, hh·, ·ii may
be the Bergman metric on D, or if D is contained in a complex domain
D̂ of larger dimension as B-submanifold, then we can take hh·, ·ii as
the restriction of the Bergman metric of D̂ to D. Let j be the complex
structure on b given by
#
(jX)#
p = j0 Xp

(X ∈ b),

and let h·, ·i be the inner product on b given by
hX, Y i = hhX # , Y # ii(p) (X, Y ∈ b).
By Gindikin, Piatetski-Shapiro, and Vinberg [9, Part III, Lemma 1],
there exists a linear form ω ∈ b∗ such that
hX, Y i = ω([jX, Y ]) (X, Y ∈ b),
and (b, j, ω) is a normal j-algebra. Namely, b is a real split solvable
Lie algebra with the equality
(3.1)

[X, Y ] + j[jX, Y ] + j[X, jY ] = [jX, jY ] (X, Y ∈ b)

and the bilinear form hX, Y i = ω([jX, Y ]) (X, Y ∈ b) is a j-invariant
inner product, that is,
hX, Xi > 0 (X 6= 0 ∈ b),
hjX, jY i = hX, Y i (X, Y ∈ b).
It is known that a = [b, b]⊥ is a Cartan subalgebra of b. For α ∈ a∗ ,
let bα be the root space associated to α given by
bα = {X ∈ b; [A, X] = α(A)X (A ∈ a)}.
Theorem 3.1 (Piatetski-Shapiro, [28, Chapter 2, Section 3 and 5]).
For a suitable basis A1 , · · · , Ar of a, the following assertions hold: if
we put Ek = −jAk , then we have [Ak , El ] = δk,l El (1 ≤ k, l ≤ r), if we
denote the dual basis of A1 , · · · , Ar by α1 , · · · , αr ∈ a∗ , then we have
b = b(0) ⊕ b(1/2) ⊕ b(1),

1≤k<l≤r

and the equalities bαk = REk , jb(αl −αk )/2 = b(αl +αk )/2 , and jbαk /2 =
bαk /2 hold. We have the relation
[b(γ), b(γ ′ )] ⊂ b(γ + γ ′ )

(γ, γ ′ = 0, 1/2, 1),

where we put b(γ) = 0 for γ > 1.
Following [28, Chapter 2, Section 5], we introduce the Siegel domain D(Ω, Q) on which the group B acts simply transitively as affine
automorphisms as follows. Put
E = E1 + · · · + Er .
Let B(0) be the connected Lie subgroup of B with Lie algebra b(0), and
let Ω = Ad(B(0))E ⊂ b(1). Let Q : (b(1/2), j) × (b(1/2), j) → b(1)C
be the sesquilinear map defined by
1
Q(V, V ′ ) = ([jV, V ′ ] + i[V, V ′ ]) (V, V ′ ∈ b(1/2)).
4
Then Ω ⊂ b(1) is an open convex cone containing no straight lines, and
B(0) acts on Ω simply transitively. One has Q(V, V ) ∈ Ω \ {0} for all
V ∈ b(1/2) \ {0}. Let
D(Ω, Q) = {(U, V ) ∈ b(1)C ⊕ b(1/2) : ℑU − Q(V, V ) ∈ Ω}.
The subgroup B(0) acts on D(Ω, Q) by
t0 (U, V ) = (Ad(t0 )U, Ad(t0 )V ) (t0 ∈ B(0), (U, V ) ∈ D(Ω, Q)),
and for U0 ∈ b(1) and V0 ∈ b(1/2), the element exp(U0 + V0 ) of B acts
on D(Ω, Q) by
(3.2)
exp(U0 + V0 )(U, V ) = (U + U0 + 2iQ(V, V0 ) + iQ(V0 , V0 ), V + V0 )
((U, V ) ∈ D(Ω, Q)).
Define C : D(Ω, Q) → D by C(b(iE, 0)) = bp (b ∈ B). Then the map C
is biholomorphic and is a generalization of the Cayley transform.
Remark 3.2.
(i) The exponential map exp : b → B is bijective ([7],
Theorem 5.2.16), and we have B = B(0) ⋉ exp(b(1/2) ⊕ b(1))
(see Lemma 3.4).

is orthogonal with respect to h·, ·i.
(iii) The number r = dim a is called the rank of b.
(iv) An open convex cone Ω0 in a finite-dimensional vector space V
is called regular if Ω0 contains no straight lines, and is called
homogeneous if the group
G(Ω0 ) = {A ∈ GL(V); AΩ0 = Ω0 }
acts on Ω0 transitively. Thus the open convex cone Ω in b(1) is
regular and homogeneous.
Example 3.3. Let q ≥ r ≥ 1. The domain
DI (q, r) = {z ∈ M(q, r; C); kzkop < 1}
is a bounded symmetric domain of type I, where kzkop denotes the operator norm of z. Put
Hr (C) = {U ∈ Mr (C); U = t U },
Pr = {U ∈ Hr (C); U ≫ 0}.
We have the following isomorphisms:
b(1) ≃ Hr (C),

Ω ≃ Pr ,

b(1/2) ≃ M(q − r, r; C),

and the following domain is biholomorphic to DI (q, r):

Lemma 3.4. Let G0 be a connected and simply connected real split
solvable Lie group, let exp : g0 → G0 be the exponential map, and let
h, h′ ⊂ g0 be subalgebras such that g0 = h ⋉ h′ . Then the subsets exp(h)
and exp(h′ ) of G0 are connected Lie subgroups of G0 .
Proof. Let H and H ′ be connected and simply connected Lie groups
with Lie algebras h and h′ , respectively. By [19, Theorem 1.125], there
exists an action τ of H on H ′ by automorphisms such that the Lie
algebra of the semidirect product H ×τ H ′ is isomorphic to h ⋉ h′ . Let
H̃ and H̃ ′ be the connected Lie subgroups of G0 with Lie algebras h
and h′ , respectively. Since Lie groups G0 and H ×τ H ′ are isomorphic,
the connected Lie subgroups H̃ and H̃ ′ are simply connected. By [7,

16

KOICHI ARASHI

Theorem 5.2.16], we have exp(h) = H̃ and exp(h′ ) = H̃ ′ since h and h′
are also exponential.

4. Algebraic properties of g
4.1. Holomorphic complete vector fields on Siegel domains.
Let U be a finite-dimensional vector space over R, let Ω0 ⊂ U be an
open regular convex cone, let V be a finite-dimensional vector space
over C, and let Q0 : V × V → UC be a Ω0 -positive Hermitian map, that
is,
Q0 (v, v) ∈ Ω0 \ {0} (v ∈ V \ {0}).
The following domain D(Ω0 , Q0 ) ⊂ UC ⊕ V is called a Siegel domain:
D(Ω0 , Q0 ) = {(u, v) ∈ UC ⊕ V; ℑu − Q0 (v, v) ∈ Ω0 }.
Let X = X(D(Ω0 , Q0 )) be the space of complete holomorphic vector
fields on D(Ω0 , Q0 ). The map
authol (D(Ω0 , Q0 )) ∋ X 7→ X # ∈ X
is bijective, and we have
[X, Y ]# = [Y # , X # ] (X, Y ∈ authol (D(Ω0 , Q0 ))).
For u0 ∈ U, let ∂u0 be the holomorphic vector field on D(Ω0 , Q0 ) given
by
∂u0 (u, v) = (u0 , 0) ((u, v) ∈ D(Ω0 , Q0 )).
Here for every (u, v) ∈ D(Ω0 , Q), we identify the tangent space T(u,v) D(Ω0 , Q0 )
with UC ⊕ V, and we consider a vector filed X ∈ X as a (UC ⊕ V)-valued
function. We denote by DX the corresponding differential operator
DX f (u, v) =

d
dt

f ((u, v) + tX(u, v)),
t=0

where f is a vector-valued smooth function on D(Ω0 , Q0 ). Then we
have
[X, Y ] = DX Y − DY X (X, Y ∈ X).
For v0 ∈ V, let ∂˜v0 be the holomorphic vector field on D(Ω0 , Q0 ) given
by
∂˜v0 (u, v) = (2iQ0 (v, v0 ), v0 ) ((u, v) ∈ D(Ω0 , Q0 )).
For complex endomorphisms A ∈ gl(UC ) and B ∈ gl(V), let X (A, B)
be the holomorphic vector field on D(Ω0 , Q0 ) given by
X (A, B)(u, v) = (Au, Bv) ((u, v) ∈ D(Ω0 , Q0 )).
We say B ∈ gl(V) is associated with A ∈ gl(UC ) if the equality
AQ0 (v, v ′ ) = Q0 (Bv, v ′) + Q0 (v, Bv ′ ) (v, v ′ ∈ V)

HOLOMORPHIC MULTIPLIER REPRESENTATIONS

17

holds. Let ∂ be the infinitesimal generator of the one-parameter subgroup D(Ω0 , Q0 ) ∋ (u, v) 7→ (et u, et/2 v) ∈ D(Ω0 , Q0 ) (t ∈ R). Then we
have ∂(u, v) = (u, 1/2v) ((u, v) ∈ D(Ω0 , Q0 )), that is,
∂ = X (idUC , 21 idV ).
For γ ∈ R, we put
X(γ) = {X ∈ X; [∂, X] = γX}.
Let g(Ω0 ) denote the Lie algebra of the Lie group G(Ω0 ).
Theorem 4.1 (Kaup, Matsushima, Ochiai, [18, Theorem 4 and 5]).
The Lie algebra X has the following gradation:
X = X(−1) ⊕ X(−1/2) ⊕ X(0) ⊕ X(1/2) ⊕ X(1),
P
and the non-positive part γ≤0 X(γ) is the Lie algebra corresponding
to the group of affine automorphisms of D(Ω0 , Q0 ). One has
X(−1) = {∂u0 ; u0 ∈ U},
X(−1/2) = {∂˜v ; v0 ∈ V},
0

and
X(0) = {X (A, B); A ∈ g(Ω0 ), B ∈ gl(V), B is associated with A}.
We denote by D(Ω0 ) the tube domain {u ∈ UC ; ℑu ∈ Ω0 }, which is
a special case of the Siegel domain with V = 0 and Q0 = 0, and for
A ∈ gl(UC ), let X (A) be the holomorphic vector field on D(Ω0 ) given
by X (A)(u) = Au (u ∈ D(Ω0 )). Then we see that
X(D(Ω0 ))(0) = {X (A); A ∈ g(Ω0 )}.
We have the following formulas (see [30, Chapter V, §1]):
(4.1)

[X (A, B), ∂u0 ] = −∂Au0 ,

(4.2)

[X (A, B), ∂˜v ] = −∂˜Bv ,

(4.3)

[X (A, B), X (A′, B′ )] = −X ([A, A′], [B, B′ ]).

Next we see explicit descriptions of X(1/2) and X(1).
Proposition 4.2 (Satake, [30, Chapter V, Proposition 2.1]). Every
element of X(1/2) is uniquely written as
(4.4)
YΦ,c (u, v) = (2iQ0 (v, Φ(u)), Φ(u) + c(v, v)) ((u, v) ∈ D(Ω0 , Q0 ))
with a C-linear map Φ : UC → V and a symmetric C-bilinear map
c : V × V → V which satisfy the following conditions:
(Y1) for each v0 ∈ V, the linear map

18

Φv0 : U ∋ u 7→ ℑQ0 (Φ(u), v0 ) ∈ U
belongs to g(Ω0 ),
(Y2)

Q0 (c(v ′ , v ′ ), v) = 2iQ0 (v ′ , Φ(Q0 (v, v ′))) (v, v ′ ∈ V).

Conversely, for any pair (Φ, c) satisfying (Y 1) and (Y 2), the vector
field YΦ,c given by (4.4) belongs to X(1/2).
Let e ∈ Ω0 . As we shall see at the end of this subsection, every vector
field YΦ,c is uniquely determined by the vector Φ(e) ∈ V, so that YΦ,c
will be also written as YΦ .
Proposition 4.3 (Satake, [30, Chapter V, Proposition 2.2]). Every
element of X(1) is uniquely written as
(4.5)

Za,b (u, v) = (a(u, u), b(u, v)) ((u, v) ∈ D(Ω0 , Q0 ))

with a symmetric R-bilinear map a : U × U → U (which we extend to a
C-bilinear map a : UC ×UC → UC ) and a C-bilinear map b : UC ×V → V
which satisfy the following conditions:
(Z1) for each u0 ∈ U, the linear map
Au0 : U ∋ u 7→ a(u0 , u) ∈ U
belongs to g(Ω0 ),
(Z2) for any u0 ∈ U, the linear map
Bu0 : V ∋ v 7→ 21 b(u0 , v) ∈ V
is associated with Au0 , and ℑ tr Bu0 = 0,
(Z3) for any v, v ′ ∈ V, the linear map
U ∋ u 7→ ℑQ0 (b(u, v), v ′) ∈ U
belongs to g(Ω0 ),
(Z4)
Q0 (b(Q0 (v ′′ , v ′ ), v ′′ ), v) = Q0 (v ′′ , b(Q0 (v, v ′′), v ′ )) (v, v ′ , v ′′ ∈ V).
Conversely, for any pair (a, b) satisfying (Z1), (Z2), (Z3), and (Z4),
the vector field Za,b given by (4.5) belongs to X(1).
Example 4.4. Let

Then we have
X(1/2) = {YΦ ; Φ ∈ M(q − r, r; C)}.
We put for a ∈ Hr (C)
Za (U, V ) = (UaU, V aU).
Then we have
X(1) = {Za ; a ∈ Hr (C)}.
Lemma 4.5 (Satake, [30, Chapter V, §2]). The following hold:
(4.6)

[∂u , YΦ ] = ∂˜Φ(u) ,

(4.7)

[∂˜v , YΦ ] = X (A, B),

where A and B are given by A = 4Φv and B : V ∋ v ′ 7→ 2iΦ(Q0 (v ′ , v))+
2c(v, v ′) ∈ V. Moreover we have
[∂u , Za,b ] = 2X (Au, Bu ).

(4.8)

We fix a reference point (ie, 0) ∈ D(Ω0 , Q0 ). Next we see a description of the subalgebra
X(ie,0) = {X ∈ X; X(ie, 0) = 0}.
Let ∂ ′ be the element of X(0) given by
∂ ′ (u, v) = (0, iv) ((u, v) ∈ D(Ω0 , Q0 )),
and let ψe : X(1/2) → X(−1/2), and ϕe : X(1) → X(−1) be linear
maps given by
ψe = ad(∂ ′ )ad(∂e )|X(1/2) ,
and

1
ϕe = ad(∂e )2 |X(1) ,

respectively. Put
m = {X + ψe (X); X ∈ X(1/2)},
m′ = {X + ϕe (X); X ∈ X(1)}.
Theorem 4.6 (Kaup, Matsushima, Ochiai, [18, Theorem 6]).
X(ie,0) = (X(ie,0) ∩ X(0)) + m′ + m.
We note that ϕe and ψe are injective (see [30, p. 211−212]), and by
[30, p. 215], we have
(4.9)

ψe (YΦ ) = ∂˜−iΦ(e) .

20

4.2. Relationship between X(1/2) and X(1). First we prove the
following lemma on the relationship between X(1/2) and X(1).
Lemma 4.7. Let ∂u0 ∈ X(−1). If [∂u0 , X(1)] = {0}, then we have
[∂u0 , X(1/2)] = {0}.
Proof. Let YΦ ∈ X(1/2). Then YiΦ ∈ X(1/2) by Proposition 4.2. We
put Za,b = [YΦ , YiΦ ]. Then the equality
a(u, u) = 4Q0 (Φ(u), Φ(u)) (u ∈ U)
holds (see [30, Chapter V, Lemma 2.5]). It follows from (4.8) that
0 = [∂u0 , Za,b ] = 2X (Au0 , Bu0 ). Hence
0 = Au0 (u0 ) = a(u0 , u0 ) = 4Q0 (Φ(u0 ), Φ(u0 )).
By the Ω0 -positivity of Q0 , we get Φ(u0 ) = 0. Using (4.6), we get
[∂u , YΦ ] = ∂˜Φ(u ) = 0.


Lemma 4.8. Let X (A, B) ∈ X(0), and let YΦ,c ∈ X(1/2). We define
a C-linear map Φ′ : UC → V and a C-bilinear map c′ : V × V → V by
YΦ′ ,c′ = [YΦ , X (A, B)]. Then the followings hold:
(i) Φ′ (u) = −Φ(Au) + BΦ(u) (u ∈ UC ),
(ii) c′ (v, v) = Bc(v, v) − 2c(Bv, v) (v ∈ V).
Proof. For (u, v) ∈ D(Ω0 , Q0 ), we have
[YΦ,c , X (A, B)](u, v) = (2iAQ0 (v, Φ(u)), B(Φ(u) + c(v, v)))
− (2iQ0 (v, Φ(Au)) + 2iQ0 (Bv, Φ(u)), Φ(Au) + 2c(Bv, v)) ∈ UC ⊕ V.
We see from this expression that the image of [YΦ,c , X (A, B)](u, v) under the 2nd projection UC ⊕ V ∋ (u, v) 7→ v ∈ V is equal to
BΦ(u) − Φ(Au) + Bc(v, v) − 2c(Bv, v),
which is same as Φ′ (u) + c′ (v, v).



Lemma 4.9. Let Za,b ∈ X(1), and let X (A, B) ∈ X(0). We define
C-bilinear maps a′ : UC × UC → UC and b′ : UC × V → V by Za′ ,b′ =
[Za,b , X (A, B)]. Then the followings hold:
(i) a′ (u, u) = Aa(u, u) − 2a(Au, u) (u ∈ UC ),
(ii) b′ (u, v) = Bb(u, v) − b(Au, v) − b(u, Bv) (u ∈ UC , v ∈ V).
Proof. For (u, v) ∈ D(Ω0 , Q0 ), we have
[Z a,b , X (A, B)](u, v)
= (Aa(u, u), Bb(u, v)) − (2a(Au, u), b(Au, v) + b(u, Bv))
= (Aa(u, u) − 2a(Au, u), Bb(u, v) − b(Au, v) − b(u, Bv)) ∈ UC ⊕ V,

which is same as (a′ (u, u), b′ (u, v)).

Proposition 4.10. Assume that dim U = 1 and that f is a subalgebra
of X which contains X(−1/2) and ∂. Then for any YΦ ∈ f, we have
YiΦ ∈ f.
Proof. When Φ(e) = 0, we have ψe (YΦ ) = ∂˜−iΦ(e) = 0 (4.9). Since
ψe is injective, we have YΦ = 0. Thus Φ = 0 and the result follows.
In what follows, we assume that Φ(e) 6= 0. We define C-linear maps
A ∈ gl(UC ), B ∈ gl(V), and Φ′ : UC → V by
X (A, B) = [∂˜Φ(e) , YΦ ],

YΦ′ = [YΦ , X (A, B)].

By assumption, we have X (A, B) ∈ f and YΦ′ ∈ f. Our goal is to prove
that Φ′ (e) = CiΦ(e) with some constant C ∈ R \ {0}. Indeed, if the
equation Φ′ (e) = CiΦ(e) holds, then we have
ψe (YΦ′ ) = ∂˜−iΦ′ (e) = ∂˜CΦ(e) = C ∂˜Φ(e) = Cψe (YiΦ ) = ψe (CYiΦ ),
and since ψe is injective, CYiΦ = YΦ′ ∈ f. Put v0 = Φ(e). By (4.7), we
have
Ae = 4ℑQ0 (v0 , Φ(e)) = 4ℑQ0 (v0 , v0 ) = 0.
Since U = Re, we can define a Hermitian form q0 on V by
Q0 (v, v ′ ) = q0 (v, v ′)e (v, v ′ ∈ V).
Using (Y2), for any v ∈ V, we have
Q0 (c(v0 , v0 ), v) = 2iQ0 (v0 , Φ(Q0 (v, v0 ))) = 2iQ0 (v0 , q0 (v, v0 )Φ(e))
= 2iQ0 (v0 , q0 (v, v0 )v0 ) = 2iq0 (v0 , v)Q0 (v0 , v0 ) = Q0 (2iq0 (v0 , v0 )v0 , v).
Hence c(v0 , v0 ) = 2iq0 (v0 , v0 )v0 . Using (4.7), we get
Bv0 = 2iΦ(Q0 (v0 , v0 )) + 2c(v0 , v0 ) = 2iq0 (v0 , v0 )Φ(e) + 4iq0 (v0 , v0 )v0
= 6iq0 (v0 , v0 )v0 .
Thanks to Lemma 4.8 (i), we obtain
Φ′ (e) = −Φ(Ae) + BΦ(e) = Bv0 = 6iq0 (v0 , v0 )v0 = 6q0 (v0 , v0 )iΦ(e)
with 6q0 (v0 , v0 ) 6= 0.

4.3. Vector fields on homogeneous Siegel domains. Consider the
action of the group B on the domain D(Ω, Q) as in Section 3. Let
X = X(D(Ω, Q)) be the space of complete holomorphic vector fields
on D(Ω, Q). For a subspace W ⊂ authol D(Ω, Q), let W # = {X # ; X ∈
W} ⊂ X. Now we have
T # = X (ad(T )|b(1)C , ad(T )|b(1/2) ) (T ∈ b(0)).

22

KOICHI ARASHI

Thus ∂ = (jE)# ∈ b# . By (3.2), we also have
U # = ∂U (U ∈ b(1)),
V # = ∂˜V (V ∈ b(1/2)).
From these expressions, we see that
b(1)# = X(−1),

b(1/2)# = X(−1/2),

b(0)# ⊂ X(0).

Note that there is a natural action of G on D(Ω, Q) which is given as
the transfer of the action of G on D by means of the biholomorphic
map C. We also have the B-invariant metric hh·, ·ii on D(Ω, Q) which is
the transfer of the metric hh·, ·ii on D. We denote by ∇ the Levi-Civita
˜ : b × b → b by
connection on (D(Ω, Q), hh·, ·ii). We define a map ∇

Lemma 4.12. Let 1 ≤ k ≤ r, and let A ∈ g(Ω). Then

Proof. The connected Lie subgroup of B with the Lie algebra b(0)⊕b(1)
is an Iwasawa subgroup of Authol (D(Ω)), and we have
g(Ω) = gE (Ω) ⊕ {ad(X); X ∈ b(0)},
where gE (Ω) is the Lie algebra of the Lie group
GE (Ω) = {A ∈ G(Ω); AE = E}.
The result for A = ad(X) with X ∈ b(0) follows from (3.1). Let
A ∈ gE (Ω). By (4.1), we have [X (A), Ek# ] = −(AEk )# . Let hh·, ·ii′
be the Bergman metric on D(Ω), and let ∇′ denote the connection on
˜ ′ : (b(0) ⊕ b(1)) × (b(0) ⊕
(D(Ω), hh·, ·ii′). Then we also have the map ∇
b(1)) → b(0) ⊕ b(1), which is defined by (4.10). Let 1 ≤ l ≤ r and
l 6= k. Since X (A) generates isometries of D(Ω), we have

Lemma 4.14. Let YΦ ∈ X(1/2). Then the followings hold:

#
(ii) [A#
k , [Al , YΦ ]] = 0 (1 ≤ k ≤ r, 1 ≤ l ≤ r, k 6= l).

Proof. Let 1 ≤ k ≤ r, 1 ≤ l ≤ r, and k 6= l. We define C-linear maps
Φl , Φlk : b(1)C → b(1/2) by
YΦl = [YΦ , A#

YΦlk = [YΦl , A#

By Lemma 4.8 (i), we have
Φlk (E)

= −(−Φ([Al , [Ak , E]]) + [Al , Φ([Ak , E])]) + [Ak , −Φ([Al , E]) + [Al , Φ(E)]]
= −[Al , Φ([Ak , E])] − [Ak , Φ([Al , E])] = −[Al , Φ(Ek )] − [Ak , Φ(El )].

Thus to prove (ii), it is enough to show that
(4.16)

[Al , Φ(Ek )] = 0.

For any V ∈ b(1/2), we have
[V, Φ(Ek )] = −4ℑQ(Φ(Ek ), V ) = −4ΦV (Ek ).
Since ΦV ∈ g(Ω), Lemma 4.12 implies that
X⊕
[V, Φ(Ek )] ∈

Thus Lemma 4.13 shows that Φ(Ek ) ∈ bαk /2 . Hence (4.16) holds, and
the proof is complete.

Put
f = g# ,

f(γ) = {X ∈ f : [∂, X] = γX} (γ ∈ R).

Lemma 4.15. The center z(f) of f is trivial.
Proof. Let X ∈ z(f). Then we have X ∈ f(0) since [∂, X] = 0. Put
X = X (A, B) ∈ f(0). By (4.1), for any U ∈ b(1), we have
0 = [X (A, B), ∂U ] = −∂AU .
Thus A = 0, and also B = 0 by (4.2). Now we see that
X = X (A, B) = 0.

D(Ω̌, Q̌) = {(U, V ) ∈ b̌(1)C ⊕ b̌(1/2); ℑU − Q(V, V ) ∈ Ω̌}.
According to Lemma 4.16 below, the following inclusion holds:
iE1 + D(Ω̌, Q̌) ⊂ D(Ω, Q).
Lemma 4.16. Ω̌ + E1 = Ω ∩ (b̌(1) + E1 ).
Proof. It follows from [13, Proposition 2.5].
Lemma 4.17.



(i) Let YΦ ∈ X̌(1/2). Then

YΦ (iE1 + U, V ) ∈ b̌(1)C ⊕ b̌(1/2) (U ∈ b̌(1)C , V ∈ b̌(1/2)).
(ii) An element YΦ of X(1/2) belongs to X̌(1/2) if and only if [YΦ , A#
1 ] =
0.
Proof. (i) Let YΦ ∈ X̌(1/2). By Lemma 4.8 (i), we have
Φ([A1 , U]) = [A1 , Φ(U)] (U ∈ b(1)C ).
Thus
Φ([A1 , E]) = Φ([A1 , [A1 , E]]) = [A1 , Φ([A1 , E])],
which implies
(4.17)

Φ(E1 ) = Φ([A1 , E]) = 0.

Let U ∈ b̌(1)C , and let V ∈ b̌(1/2).
[A1 , Φ(U)] = 0, and hence

Lemma 4.8 (i) shows that

Φ(U) ∈ b̌(1/2).

(4.18)

By (4.17) and (4.18), we see that
(4.19)

2iQ(V, Φ(−iE1 + U)) = 2iQ(V, Φ(U )) ∈ b̌(1)C .

On the other hand, from Lemma 4.8 (ii), it follows that [A1 , c(V, V )] =
0. Thus c(V, V ) ∈ b̌(1/2). We see from from (4.18) and (4.19) that
Φ(iE1 + U) + c(V, V ) ∈ b̌(1/2),
which proves (i).
(ii) Let YΦ ∈ X(1/2), and suppose that [YΦ , A#
1 ] = 0. Then we see
from (4.6) and (4.17) that
[E1# , YΦ ] = (Φ(E1 ))# = 0.
This proves (ii).

To simplify some of the notation, we abbreviate ψE : X(1/2) →
X(−1/2) and ϕE : X(1) → X(−1) as ψ and ϕ, respectively.

Lemma 4.18. Consider D(Ω̌, Q̌) as a complex submanifold of D(Ω, Q).
Then for YΦ ∈ X̌(1/2), we have YΦ |iE1 +b̌(1)C ⊕b̌(1/2) ∈ X(D(Ω̌, Q̌))(1/2),
and the map X̌(1/2) ∋ YΦ 7→ YΦ |iE1 +b̌(1)C ⊕b̌(1/2) ∈ X(D(Ω̌, Q̌))(1/2) is
injective.
Proof. First by Lemma 4.16, the following equality holds:
iE1 + D(Ω̌, Q̌) = D(Ω, Q) ∩ (iE1 + b̌(1)C ⊕ b̌(1/2)).
Let YΦ ∈ X̌(1/2), and let X be the element of authol (D(Ω, Q)) such that
X # = YΦ . Let y : R → Authol (D(Ω, Q)) denote the one-parameter
subgroup of Authol (D(Ω, Q)) given by y(t) = exp(tX) (t ∈ R). Then
y preserves D(Ω, Q) ∩ (iE1 + b̌(1)C ⊕ b̌(1/2)) by Lemma 4.17. Thus
YΦ |iE1 +b̌(1)C ⊕b̌(1/2) ∈ X(D(Ω̌, Q̌)). Let ∂ be the vector field on D(Ω, Q)
defined in Section 4.1. Since
[(A2 + · · · + Ar )# , YΦ ] = [(A1 + · · · + Ar )# , YΦ ] = [∂, YΦ ] = 21 YΦ ,
we have YΦ |iE1 +b̌(1)C ⊕b̌(1/2) ∈ X(D(Ω̌, Q̌))(1/2). It remains to show
that the map X̌(1/2) ∋ YΦ 7→ YΦ |iE1 +b̌(1)C ⊕b̌(1/2) ∈ X(D(Ω̌, Q̌))(1/2) is
injective. Suppose that YΦ |iE1 +b̌(1)C ⊕b̌(1/2) = 0. The image of YΦ (iE, 0)
under the projection b(1)C ⊕ b(1/2) ∋ (U, V ) 7→ V ∈ b(1/2) is iΦ(E),
which is equal to 0. Hence we see from (4.9) that ψ(YΦ ) = ∂˜−iΦ(E) = 0.
Since ψ is injective, we obtain YΦ = 0.

Lemma 4.19. Let Za,b ∈ X̌(1). Then
Za,b (iE1 + U, V ) ∈ b̌(1)C ⊕ b̌(1/2) (U ∈ b̌(1)C , V ∈ b̌(1/2)).
Proof. By Lemma 4.9, for U ∈ b(1)C and V ∈ b(1/2), we have
(4.20)

[A1 , a(U, U)] = 2a([A1 , U], U)

and
(4.21)

[A1 , b(U, V )] = b([A1 , U], V ) + b(U, [A1 , V ]).

Put U = iE1 . Then (4.20) becomes
[A1 , a(iE1 , iE1 )] = 2a(iE1 , iE1 ).
Hence we have
(4.22)

a(iE1 , iE1 ) = 0.

Let U ∈ b̌(1)C , and let V ∈ b̌(1/2). Then (4.20) gives
(4.23)

[A1 , a(U, U)] = 0.

28

KOICHI ARASHI

From (4.20), (4.22), and (4.23), it follows that
2[A1 , a(iE1 , U)] = [A1 , a(iE1 + U, iE1 + U)]
= 2a([A1 , iE1 + U], iE1 + U)
= 2a(iE1 , U).
Thus a(iE1 , U) ∈ (bα1P
)C . At the same time, for k 6= 1, we have
a(E1 , Ek ) = AE1 Ek ∈ ⊕
1≤m≤r b(αm +αk )/2 by Lemma 4.12, and hence
AE1 Ek = 0. Thus we get AE1 E = 0, which implies AE1 ∈ gE (Ω).
Hence the map AE1 : b(1) → b(1) is an orthogonal transformation
with respect to the inner product h·, ·i′ on b(0) ⊕ b(1) defined by
hX, Y i′ = hhX # , Y # ii′iE

(X, Y ∈ b(0) ⊕ b(1)).

Thus the equality
a(E1 , U) = AE1 U = 0

(4.24)

follows from the equation A2E1 U = 0. By (4.22), (4.23), and (4.24), we
get
(4.25) a(iE1 + U, iE1 + U) = a(U, U) + 2a(iE1 , U) = a(U, U) ∈ b̌(1)C .
On the other hand, by (4.21), we have
(4.26)

[A1 , b(iE1 + U, V )] = b(iE1 , V )

and
(4.27)

[A1 , b(U, V )] = 0.

Now (4.26) implies b(iE1 , V ) = 0, and (4.27) implies b(U, V ) ∈ b̌(1/2).
Thus
b(iE1 + U, V ) = b(U, V ) ∈ b̌(1/2).

(4.28)

We see from (4.25) and (4.28) that (i) follows.



Lemma 4.20. Consider D(Ω̌, Q̌) as a complex submanifold of D(Ω, Q).
Then for any γ ∈ {−1, −1/2, 0, 1/2, 1} and X ∈ X̌(γ), we have
X|iE1 +b̌(1)C ⊕b̌(1/2) ∈ X(D(Ω̌, Q̌))(γ).
Proof. Let U0 ∈ b(1), and suppose [∂U0 , A#
1 ] = 0. Then [A1 , U0 ] = 0 by
(4.1), and we have U0 ∈ b̌(1). Since
∂U0 (iE1 + U, V ) = (U0 , 0) (U ∈ b̌(1)C , V ∈ b̌(1/2)),
the result for γ = −1 follows. Let V0 ∈ b(1/2), and suppose [∂˜V0 , A#
1 ] =
0. Then [A1 , V0 ] = 0 by (4.2), and V0 ∈ b̌(1/2). Since
∂˜V (iE1 + U, V ) = (2iQ(V, V0 ), V0) (U ∈ b̌(1)C , V ∈ b̌(1/2)),
0

HOLOMORPHIC MULTIPLIER REPRESENTATIONS

29

the result for γ = −1/2 follows. Let X (A, B) ∈ X(0), and suppose
[X (A, B), A#
1 ] = 0. Then we see from (4.3) that
Aad(A1 ) = ad(A1 )A and Bad(A1 ) = ad(A1 )B.
Hence we have
[A1 , AU] = [A1 , BV ] = 0 (U ∈ b̌(1)C , V ∈ b̌(1/2)).
Thus AU ∈ b̌(1)C , BV ∈ b̌(1/2) for all U ∈ b̌(1)C and V ∈ b̌(1/2).
Now suppose [X (A, B), E1# ] = 0. Then AE1 = 0 by (4.1). We have
X (A, B)(iE1 +U, V ) = (A(iE1 +U), BV ) = (AU, BV ) (U ∈ b̌(1)C , V ∈ b̌(1/2)),
which shows the assertion for γ = 0. We have shown the result for
γ = 1/2 in Lemma 4.18. From Lemma 4.19 and the same arguments
as in Lemma 4.18, the result for γ = 1 follows. This completes the
proof.

Remark 4.21. The equality
f̌ = f̌(−1) ⊕ f̌(−1/2) ⊕ f̌(0) ⊕ f̌(1/2) ⊕ f̌(1)
shows that for any X ∈ X̌, we have X|iE1 +b̌(1)C ⊕b̌(1/2) ∈ X(D(Ω̌, Q̌)),
and the map
X̌ ∋ X 7→ X|iE1+b̌(1)C ⊕b̌(1/2) ∈ X(D(Ω̌, Q̌))
defines a Lie algebra homomorphism.
Proposition 4.22. For any YΦ ∈ f, one has YjΦ ∈ f.
Proof. We show the assertion by induction on rank r of the normal jalgebra. For the case r = 1, we have shown the assertion in Proposition
4.10. Let r ≥ 2. We define a C-linear map Φ′ : b(1)C → b(1/2) by
YΦ′ = [YΦ , A#
1 ].
By Lemma 4.14 (ii), we have
#
#
[YΦ′ , A#
k ] = [[YΦ , A1 ], Ak ] = 0 (2 ≤ k ≤ r).

Thus
#
#
[YΦ+2Φ′ , A#
1 ] = YΦ′ + [Y2Φ′ , A1 ] = YΦ′ + [Y2Φ′ , (A1 + · · · + Ar ) ]
= YΦ′ + [Y2Φ′ , ∂] = YΦ′ − YΦ′ = 0.
From Lemma 4.17, it follows that YΦ+2Φ′ ∈ f̌. We denote by R the
Lie algebra homomorphism in Remark 4.21. Since (b̌)# ⊂ f̌, one has
R((b̌)# ) ⊂ R(f̌) ⊂ X(D(Ω̌, Q̌)). By the inductive hypothesis and the
equality R(YΦ+2Φ′ ) = Y(Φ+2Φ′ |b̌(1) +b̌(1/2) ) , we get

Hence we see from Lemma 4.18 that
Yj(Φ+2Φ′ ) ∈ f̌.
Clearly
YjΦ = Yj(Φ+2Φ′ ) − 2YjΦ′ .
Thus in order to show that YjΦ ∈ f, it suffices to show that
YjΦ′ ∈ f.

(4.29)

Next we prove (4.29). Let c′ : b(1/2) × b(1/2) → b(1/2) be the Cbilinear map such that YΦ′ = YΦ′ ,c′ . We define C-linear maps Φ′′ :
b(1)C → b(1/2), A ∈ gl(b(1)C ), and B ∈ gl(b(1/2)) by
X (A, B) = [∂˜Φ′ (E) , YΦ′ ], and YΦ′′ = [YΦ′ , X (A, B)].
The inclusion relation b# ⊂ f shows that YΦ′′ ∈ f. Put V0 = Φ′ (E). If
V0 = 0, then YΦ′ = 0, and it follows that Φ′ = 0. Thus 0 = YjΦ′ ∈ f.
In what follows, we assume that V0 6= 0. Lemma 4.8 (i) shows that
Φ′′ (E) = −Φ′ (AE) + BΦ′ (E). And by (4.7), we have
(4.30)

AE = 4Φ′V0 (E) = 4ℑQ(V0 , V0 ) = 0

and
(4.31)

BΦ′ (E) = 2jΦ′ (Q(V0 , V0 )) + 2c′ (V0 , V0 ).

From Lemma 4.8 (i) and Lemma 4.14 (ii), it follows that
V0 = Φ′ (E) = −Φ([A1 , E]) + [A1 , Φ(E)] = − 12 Φ(E1 ) ∈ bα1 /2 .
Thus we see from (Y2) that
Q(c′ (V0 , V0 ), V ) = 2iQ(V0 , Φ′ (Q(V, V0 ))) ∈

By Lemma 4.13, we have c′ (V0 , V0 ) ∈ bα1 /2 . We define a Hermitian
form q on bα1 /2 by
Q(W, W ′ ) = q(W, W ′ )E1

(W, W ′ ∈ bα1 /2 ).

By (Y2), for any V ∈ bα1 /2 , we have
Q(c′ (V0 , V0 ), V ) = 2iQ(V0 , Φ′ (Q(V, V0 ))) = 2iQ(V0 , q(V, V0 )Φ′ (E))
= 2iQ(V0 , q(V, V0 )V0 ) = 2iq(V0 , V )Q(V0 , V0 )
= Q(2jq(V0 , V0 )V0 , V ).
Thus we get
(4.32)

c′ (V0 , V0 ) = 2jq(V0 , V0 )V0 .

From (4.30), (4.31), and (4.32), it follows that
Φ′′ (E) = BΦ′ (E) = 2jΦ′ (Q(V0 , V0 )) + 4jq(V0 , V0 )V0 = 6jq(V0 , V0 )V0
= 6jq(V0 , V0 )Φ′ (E)
with q(V0 , V0 ) 6= 0. Thus (4.29) holds, and the proof is complete.

Proposition 4.23. Let ∂U0 ∈ X(−1). If [∂U0 , f(1)] = 0, then one has
[∂U0 , f(1/2)] = 0.
Proof. We replace X(γ) by f(γ) for γ = −1, 1/2, 1 in the proof of Lemma
4.7. To complete the proof, it is enough to show that YjΦ ∈ f(1/2).
Hence the result follows from Proposition 4.22.

Put θ = θM ∈ (g− )∗ .
Theorem 5.2 (Ishi, [15, Theorem 12]). Let χθ be the function on B
defined by
χθ (exp X) = eθ◦τ (X)

(5.1)

(X ∈ b).

Then the function
B × D(Ω, Q) ∋ (b, (U, V )) 7→ χθ (b) ∈ C×
is a holomorphic multiplier and is B-equivalent to M.
By Lemma 2.3, there exists a holomorphic function f : D(Ω, Q) →
C× such that the equality
χθ (b) = f (b(U, V ))M(b, (U, V ))f (U, V )−1

(b ∈ B, (U, V ) ∈ D(Ω, Q))

holds. We define a holomorphic multiplier Mθ : G × D(Ω, Q) → C× by
Mθ (g, (U, V )) = f (g(U, V ))M(g, (U, V ))f (U, V )−1

(g ∈ G, (U, V ) ∈ D(Ω, Q)).

Since the maps K ∋ k 7→ M(k, (iE, 0)) ∈ C× and K ∋ k 7→ Mθ (k, (iE, 0)) ∈
C× define one-dimensional representations of K, we have
M(k, (iE, 0)) = Mθ (k, (iE, 0)) (k ∈ K).
Clearly, we also have
Mθ (b, (U, V )) = χθ (b) (b ∈ B).
Now we assume that the representation TM is unitarizable. Let ξ ∈ g∗
be the linear form given by (2.6). We denote the unitarization of the
representation χiξ by (χiξ , Hξ ), and we denote the reproducing kernel
of Hξ by Kξ .
We consider the unitary representations (Tχiξ′ , Hξ′ ) which are obtained by holomorphic multipliers M ′ : G × D(Ω, Q) → C× . We review
the construction of the intertwining operators among the representations (Tχiξ′ , Hξ′ ) of B in [12, 14]. The group B(0) acts on b(1)∗ by
∗
hU, t0 ℓi = ht−1
0 U, ℓi (U ∈ b(1), t0 ∈ B(0), ℓ ∈ b(1) ).

Theorem 5.3 (Ishi, [12]). There exists a unique Ad(B(0))-orbit Oξ∗ ⊂
b(1)∗ and a unique measure dνξ on Oξ∗ such that
dνξ (t0 ℓ) = |χξ (t0 )|2 dνξ (ℓ) (ℓ ∈ Oξ∗ , t0 ∈ B(0)),

If χiξ and χ

define equivalent unitarizations, then Oξ∗ = Oξ∗′ .

In [12], Oξ∗ and dνξ are written as Oε∗ and dR∗ℜs∗ , respectively. The
dual cone Ω∗ ⊂ b(1)∗ of Ω is defined by
Ω∗ = {ℓ ∈ b(1)∗ ; hU, ℓi > 0 for all U ∈ Ω\{0}}.
For ℓ ∈ Ω∗ , let Qℓ be the Hermitian form on b(1/2) given by
Qℓ (V, V ′ ) = h2Q(V, V ′ ), ℓi (V, V ′ ∈ b(1/2)).
Then Qℓ is positive definite. Let
Nℓ = {V ∈ b(1/2); Qℓ (V, V ) = 0},
and let Fℓ be the space of holomorphic functions F on b(1/2) such that
(i) F (V + V ′R) = F (V ) for all V ∈ b(1/2) and V ′ ∈ Nℓ ,

gives a Hilbert space isomorphism.
We define a unitary representation Ťχiξ of B on Lξ by
φξ (Ťχiξ (b)f ) = Tχiξ (b)φξ (f ) (b ∈ B, f ∈ Lξ ).
For (U0 , V0 ) ∈ D(Ω, Q), let
k(U0 ,V0 ) (ℓ, V ) = e−ihU0 ,ℓi eQℓ (V,V0 )

((ℓ, V ) ∈ Oξ∗ × b(1/2)).

Then k(U0 ,V0 ) ∈ Lξ , and we have the following equalities (see [12, p.

((U, V ), (U ′ , V ′ ) ∈ D(Ω, Q)).
Suppose that the unitarizations of Tχiξ and Tχiξ′ are equivalent as
unitary representations of B. As in [14, p. 541], we fix a function
Υ 6= 0 on Oξ∗ , which is also a function on Oξ∗′ , such that
Υ(t0 ℓ) = χiξ (t0 )χ−iξ′ (t0 )Υ(ℓ) (t0 ∈ B(0), ℓ ∈ Oξ∗ ).

Proposition 5.5 (Ishi, [14, Proposition 4.5]). There exists a nonzero
constant C such that the following map Ψ̌ξ,ξ′ : Lξ → Lξ′ gives the
intertwining operator between the unitary representations (Ťχiξ , Lξ ) and
(Ťχiξ′ , Lξ′ ) of B:
Ψ̌ξ,ξ′ f (ℓ, V ) = CΥ(ℓ)f (ℓ, V ) (f ∈ Lξ , (ℓ, V ) ∈ Oξ∗ × b(1/2)).
Let ∆ξ and ∆ξ,ξ′ be the functions on Ω define by
∆ξ (t0 E) = |χiξ (t0 )|2 ,

5.2. Unitary equivalences among representations of G. Suppose
that the unitarizations (TMiξ , Hξ ) and (TMiξ′ , Hξ′ ) are equivalent as unitary representations of B. By Schur’s lemma and the decomposition
G = BK, the unitarizations are equivalent as unitary representations
of G if and only if the intertwining operator between representations
(TMiξ |B , Hξ ) and (TMiξ′ |B , Hξ′ ) preserves the actions of K. From this
point of view, we get the equation (5.5) in Proposition 5.9 below which
determines whether the unitarizations are equivalent as unitary representations of G.
From now on, we assume that (TMiξ |B , Hξ ) and (TMiξ′ |B , Hξ′ ) are
equivalent as unitary representations of B. Let Ψξ,ξ′ = φξ′ ◦ Ψ̌ξ,ξ′ ◦ φ−1

Remark 5.8. Let Ω0 ⊂ RN0 be an open convex cone, let v ∈ Ω0 , and let
v ′ ∈ Ω0 . Then it follows that v + v ′ ∈ Ω0 . Indeed, let Bǫ (v) be an open
ball of radius ǫ > 0 centered at v satisfying Bǫ (v) ⊂ Ω0 . Then we have
v0 + v ′ ∈ Ω0 for all v0 ∈ Bǫ (v). Hence we obtain v + v ′ ∈ Int(Ω0 ). It is
known that for a convex set S0 ⊂ RN0 , the equality Int(S0 ) = Int(S0 )
holds. Thus we have v + v ′ ∈ Ω0 since Ω0 is a convex set.

Proof. First we show that (i) and (ii) are equivalent. Thanks to the
remark preceding Proposition 5.9, it is enough to show that (ii) implies
(i). We suppose that (5.4) holds. Let b ∈ B, and let k ∈ K. Then we
can write kb = b′ k ′ with b′ ∈ B and k ′ ∈ K, and we have
ξ
ξ
Ψξ,ξ′ (TMiξ (k)TMiξ (b)K(iE,0)

ξ
Now Ψξ,ξ′ is continuous, and the subspace of Hξ generated by TMiξ (b)K(iE,0)
(b ∈
B) is dense in Hξ . Thus

Ψξ,ξ′ (TMiξ (k)f ) = TMiξ′ (k)Ψξ,ξ′ (f ) (k ∈ K, f ∈ Hξ ),
which implies (TMiξ , Hξ ) and (TMiξ′ , Hξ′ ) are equivalent as unitary representations of G. Thus (i) follows. Next we show that (ii) and (iii)
are equivalent. By Lemma 5.7 and the transformation law of the reproducing kernel, for k ∈ K, we have

5.3. Isotropy representation. In this subsection, we shall consider
the isotropy representation ρ : K → GL(g/k). We identify b with g/k
by the map b ∋ X 7→ X + k ∈ g/k. We denote by ω ′ ∈ b∗ the Koszul
form on b which is defined by
ω ′(X) = trb (ad(jX) − jad(X)) (X ∈ b).

HOLOMORPHIC MULTIPLIER REPRESENTATIONS

37

Then (b, j, ω ′ ) is a normal j-algebra. Put
hX, Y i′ = ω ′([jX, Y ]) (X, Y ∈ b),
and let h·, ·i′′ be the Hermitian form on b given by
hX, Y i′′ = hX, Y i′ + ihX, jY i′

(X, Y ∈ b).

Then we can regard b as a complex Hilbert space, and ρ is a unitary
representation of K. Define
btriv = {X ∈ b; [X, k] ⊂ k}.
Lemma 5.10. For any X ∈ btriv , we have [X, k] = {0}.
Proof. By Lemma 4.15, we can regard g as a subalgebra of gl(g). We
denote the connected Lie subgroup of GL(g) with Lie algebra b ⊂ gl(g)
by B0 . We put N ′ = dim g. Choose an Iwasawa subgroup B ′ of GL(g)
which contains B0 . By [27, Chapter 4, Theorem 4.9], the group B ′
is realized as the subgroup L(N ′ ) ⊂ GL(N ′ , R) of lower triangular
matrices with positive diagonal entries in some basis of g. Hence b
is realized as a subalgebra of l(N ′ ). For X ∈ l(N ′ ), the linear map
ad(X) : gl(N ′ , R) → gl(N ′ , R) has only real eigenvalues. Let X ∈ btriv .
Then the linear map ad(X) : g → g also has only real eigenvalues. On
the other hand, we have ad(X)[k, k] ⊂ [k, k], and ad(X)|[k,k] has only pure
imaginary eigenvalues and is diagonalizable. Hence ad(X)|[k,k] = 0. Put
t = z(k),

N ′′ = dim t.

T = exp t ⊂ G,

Then the Lie group T is isomorphic to

(S 1 )N = {(ζ1 , · · · , ζN ′′ ) ∈ CN ; |ζl | = 1 for all l = 1, · · · , N ′′ }.

Let F : (S 1 )N → T be an isomorphism, and let t ∈ R. The map
Inn(etX ) : T ∋ g 7→ etX ge−tX ∈ T
defines an automorphism of T. Thus there exists a map R ∋ t 7→

(m1 (t), · · · , mN ′′ (t)) ∈ ZN such that

to
′′
(iR)N = {(iγ1 , · · · , iγN ′′ ) : γl ∈ R for l = 1, · · · , N ′′ },
and we have
Ad(etX ) ◦ (F∗ )e (iγ1 , · · · , iγN ′′ ) = (F∗ )e (im1 (t)γ1 , · · · , imN ′′ (t)γN ′′ )

ential of F at e ∈ (S 1 )N . Since ZN is discrete, we have ad(X)|t = 0.
Thus it follows that [X, k] = {0}.

Let γ ∈ {−1, −1/2, 0, 1/2, 1}, and let g(γ) ⊂ g be the subspace given

g(γ) = {X ∈ g; ad(jE)X = −γX},
g = g(−1) ⊕ g(−1/2) ⊕ g(0) ⊕ g(1/2) ⊕ g(1).
Note that
b(1) = g(−1),

b(1/2) = g(−1/2),

b(0) ⊂ g(0).

Proposition 5.11. The subalgebra btriv ⊂ b is ad(jE)-invariant.

[Y0 , X] = [Y0 , X−1 ] + [Y0 , X−1/2 ] + [Y0 , X0 ] = 0
with [Y0 , X−1 ] ∈ g(−1), [Y0 , X−1/2 ] ∈ g(−1/2), and [Y0 , X0 ] ∈ g(0).

5.4. Actions of the isotropy subgroup on holomorphic vector

Lemma 5.13. Let G0 be a connected compact Lie group, and let (π, V)

ζ ∈ C, put
V(X, ζ) = {v ∈ V; dπ(X)v = ζv}.
If π is irreducible and nontrivial, then

P

Proof. Let V1 = X∈g0 ,ζ∈C\{0} V(X, ζ), and let T be a maximal torus
of G0 . If V1 = 0, then the character χπ (g) = tr π(g) (g ∈ G0 ) satisfies
χπ |T = dim V identically. Two finite-dimensional representations of G0
are equivalent if and only if their character are equal (see [35, Part 2,
Corollary 5.3.4]), and any two maximal tori of G0 are conjugate (see [19,

40

Corollary 4.35]), so that π is trivial. This contradicts the assumption.
Thus V1 6= 0. Let v ∈ V(X, ζ). For g ∈ G0 , we have

so that π(g)v ∈ V(Ad(g)X, ζ). Hence V1 is a G0 -invariant subspace
of V. Since π is a finite-dimensional irreducible representation and
V1 6= 0, we have V = V1 .

Let θ : g− → C be a complex representation of g− , and let χθ : B →

Theorem 5.14. Suppose that θ(k) = 0. Extend the representation

along with the decomposition g = b ⊕ k. Then dχθ : g → C defines a

P
Proof. First we show that b⊥
triv =
W ∈k,ζ∈C\{0} b(W, ζ). Since every

irreducible subrepresentation
P of (ρ, btriv ) is nontrivial, we see from

for all X ∈ b(W, iγ). Let X ∈ b(W, iγ). Then
0 = [θ(W ), θ(X + ijX)] = θ([W, X + ijX]) = θ([W, X] + i[W, jX])
= θ(dρ(W )X + idρ(W )(jX)) = θ(γjX − γiX) = −γiθ(X + ijX).
This proves that θ(X + ijX) = 0, and hence
θ(X + ijX) = 0 (X ∈ b⊥
triv ).
⊥
Let X ∈ b⊥
triv . Then we have X−1/2 , X0 ∈ btriv by Proposition 5.12.
Thus

dχθ (X) = θ(τ (X)) = θ((X−1/2 + ijX−1/2 )/2 + X0 + ijX0 ) = 0.
We see from the above equality that dχθ ([b, k]) = 0. Now let X, X ′ ∈ g,
and write X = Y + W, X ′ = Y ′ + W ′ with Y, Y ′ ∈ b and W, W ′ ∈ k.
Then we have
dχθ ([X, X ′ ]) = dχθ ([Y, Y ′ ]) = [dχθ (Y ), dχθ (Y ′ )] = [dχθ (X), dχθ (X ′ )].
This completes the proof.

Let M, M ′ : G × D(Ω, Q) → C× be holomorphic multipliers. Put
θ = θM , θ′ = θM ′ .
Theorem 5.15. Suppose that M(k, (iE, 0)) = M ′ (k, (iE, 0)) for all
k ∈ K. Then Mθ (k, (U, V )) = Mθ′ (k, (U, V )) for all k ∈ K and
(U, V ) ∈ D(Ω, Q).
′

Proof. By Theorem 5.14, the representation dχθ−θ : b → C of b ex′
tends to a representation of g. Let us use the same symbol dχθ−θ
e be the univerto denote the extension of the representation. Let G
sal covering group of G. We denote the covering homomorphism by
e → G. Then we have G
e = p̃−1 (B)o p̃−1 (K). Since the map
p̃ : G
p̃|p̃−1(B)o : p̃−1 (B)o → B is bijective, we have p̃−1 (B)o ∩ p̃−1 (K) = {e}.

Let χ′ : G̃ → C× be the lifting of dχθ−θ : g → C to a represene For g ∈ G, let g ′ and g ′′ be elements of G̃ such that
tation of G.
′
p̃(g ) = p̃(g ′′ ) = g. Then
g ′ g ′′−1 ∈ p̃−1 (e) ⊂ p̃−1 (K).

Thus it follows that χ′ (g ′g ′′−1 ) = 1. Hence χ′ descends to G, i.e. there
exists a representation χ : G → C× such that χ′ = χ ◦ p̃. Now χ defines
a holomorphic multiplier χ : G × D(Ω, Q) → C× , and we have

Proposition 5.17. Suppose that the representations TM and TM ′ have
unitarizations (TM , H) and (TM ′ , H′ ) and that they are equivalent as
unitary representations of B. Then (TM , H) and (TM ′ , H′ ) are equivalent as unitary representations of G if and only if
M(k, (iE, 0)) = M ′ (k, (iE, 0)) (k ∈ K).
Proof. First we show the ‘only if’ part. Putting (U, V ) = (iE, 0) in
(5.5), we obtain M(k, (iE, 0)) = M ′ (k, (iE, 0)) for all k ∈ K. Second
we show the ‘if’ part. Suppose that M(k, (iE, 0)) = M ′ (k, (iE, 0)) for
all k ∈ K. Let ξ and ξ ′ be the linear forms on g given by (2.6). Then

Thus we get the equation (5.5), and hence the unitary representations

proof is complete.

Theorem 5.18. Let m, m′ : G × D → C× be holomorphic multipliers.
Suppose that there exist Hilbert spaces H and H′ of holomorphic functions on D which give the unitarizations of Tm and Tm′ , respectively.
Then the following two conditions are equivalent:
(i) (Tm , H) and (Tm′ , H′ ) are equivalent as unitary representations
of G.
(ii) (Tm , H) and (Tm′ , H′ ) are equivalent as unitary representations
of B, and m(k, p) = m′ (k, p) for all k ∈ K.

HOLOMORPHIC MULTIPLIER REPRESENTATIONS

Proof. We assume that (Tm , H) and (Tm′ , H′ ) are equivalent as unitary
representations of B. Let M, M ′ : G × D(Ω, Q) → C× be holomorphic
multipliers given by M(g, (U, V )) = m(g, C((U, V ))), M ′ (g, (U, V )) =
m′ (g, C((U, V ))). We see from Proposition 5.17 that the unitarizations
of TM and TM ′ are equivalent as unitary representations of G if and
only if M(k, (iE, 0)) = M ′ (k, (iE, 0)) for all k ∈ K. The map
C ∗ : O(D) ∋ f 7→ f ◦ C ∈ O(D(Ω, Q))
intertwines representations Tm and TM of G and also intertwines representations Tm′ and TM ′ of G. Thus (i) holds if and only if (TM , C ∗ (H))
and (TM ′ , C ∗ (H′ )) are equivalent as unitary representations of G. Moreover, by Proposition 5.17, the representations (TM , C ∗ (H)) and (TM ′ , C ∗ (H′ ))
are equivalent as unitary representations of G if and only if
m(k, p) = M(k, (iE, 0)) = M ′ (k, (iE, 0)) = m′ (k, p) (k ∈ K).
Thus (i) and (ii) are equivalent.

b(αl +αk )/2 = hEl,k i (1 ≤ k < l ≤ 3),

in Theorem 3.1. We have
b− = hE1 + iA1 , E2 + iA2 , E3 + iA3 , E3,1 + iA3,1 , E3,2 + iA3,2 i,

The subspace [k, b− ] is generated by the following elements:

[W2 , E2 + iA2 ] = −2A2 + i(W2 + 2E2 ), [W2 , E3,2 + iA3,2 ] = iE3,2 − A3,2 .
Clearly, [k, k] = 0. Thus every ξ ∈ g∗ satisfying ξ([g− , g− ]) = 0 can be
written as

(x, y, n, n′ ∈ R).
If the representation iξ|k : k → C lifts to a representation of K, then
n, n′ ∈ Z.
Let x, y ∈ R and let n, n′ ∈ Z. We shall apply Theorem 13 in [15] to
the representation Tχiξ with ξ = ξ(x, y, n, n′). The theorem gives the
set of all parameters (x, y, n, n′ ) such that the representation Tχiξ of B
is unitarizable, and defines the equivalence relation on the set which
corresponds to the unitary equivalence among the unitarizable representations. We see from Theorem 13(i) in [15] that the representation
Tχiξ has a unitarization if
