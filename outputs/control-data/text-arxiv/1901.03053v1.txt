Abstract. A vibration isolation system called Type-Bp system used for power
recycling mirrors has been developed for KAGRA, the interferometric gravitationalwave observatory in Japan. A suspension of the Type-Bp system passively isolates
an optic from seismic vibration using three main pendulum stages equipped with two
vertical vibration isolation systems. A compact reaction mass around each of the main
stages allows for achieving sufficient damping performance with a simple feedback as
well as vibration isolation ratio. Three Type-Bp systems were installed in KAGRA,
and were proved to satisfy the requirements on the damping performance, and also on
estimated residual displacement of the optics.

1. Introduction
The first detection of the gravitational waves (GWs) from the binary black hole in
2015 [1] opened a new era of GW astronomy. Furthermore, the sky localization
of the GW sources by the LIGO-Virgo joint observation enabled us to observe the
electromagnetic counterpart, which revealed further information about the compact
binary [2]. In order to improve the parameter estimation accuracy such as polarization
of the GWs [3], it is important to construct the GW observation network with more
than three detectors. Having more detectors also has the advantage of increasing the
observation rate.
KAGRA as a fourth detector is now under construction in Japan [4]. It is a GW
detector with 3-km scale cryogenic interferometer constructed underground. KAGRA
is expected to join the GW observation network within next few years [5]. In addition,
KAGRA employs the advanced features, such as construction in underground as a quiet
environment, and cryogenic mirrors for thermal noise reduction.
Figure 1 shows the configuration of the main optics in KAGRA. Each mirror is
suspended as a pendulum for vibration isolation. The pendulum-type vibration isolation
system isolates a mirror from the ground motion above the resonant frequencies of
the pendulum. The amount of vibration isolation is further increased by using long
suspensions and multiple stages.
On the other hand, the mirror swings with a large amplitude at their resonant
frequencies. It is essential for stable operation of the GW observatory to reduce the
large motion of the optics at the resonant frequencies of the suspensions. For example,

quick recovery from the large disturbance due to earthquakes or control failures using
the damping system can increase the duty cycle.
In this paper, we will introduce a vibration isolation system with a newly designed
mechanics for the damping control for power recycling mirrors in KAGRA, which is
called Type-Bp system. This damping system is rather small, but has the sufficient
performance to damp almost all the resonant modes properly.

Figure 1. (Color online) Optics and vibration isolation system in KAGRA.

Circles in figure 1 represent the type of the vibration isolation system used for each
mirror. We have four types of vibration systems according to their requirements on
residual displacement of each mirror. They are called Type-A, -B, -Bp, and -C systems
as shown in figure 2.
A suspension of the Type-A system is used for the test masses that are most
critical for the GW detection. It has the longest tower with a height of about 13 m
at room temperature, and a payload working at temperature below 20 K at the four
bottom stages. From a pre-isolator unit composed of inverted pendulums (IPs) and
a geometrical anti-spring (GAS) filter, four room-temperature stages equipped with a
GAS filter inside are suspended. The IP effectively reduces the micro seismic motion
that has large amplitude at around 0.3 Hz, since its resonant frequency is as low as
80 mHz. GAS filters are implemented in order to isolate the mirror from the vertical
seismic motion. At the bottom, four cryogenic stages including a test mass mirror are

suspended. Type-B is used for beam splitter (BS) and signal recycling (SR) mirrors.
This suspension has a pre-isolator unit at the top similarly to the suspension of Type-A,
while it has only two GAS filter stages below. The intermediate mass (IM) is suspended
from the GAS spring, and the intermediate recoil mass (IRM) is from the base plate of
the spring, independently. And from the IM, the optics and the recoil mass (RM) are
suspended independtly as well [6]. The power recycling (PR) mirrors are suspended by
suspensions of the Type-Bp system. Unlike the Type-B system, they do not have the
pre-isolator unit because of the constraint on the available space in vacuum chambers.
A suspension of the Type-C system, a double-stage pendulum, is used for the rather
small mirrors, such as the input mode cleaners and the mode matching telescopes. Its
design is the same as the one used in TAMA300 [7].
2.2. Requirement on Type-Bp and simulated results
The vibration isolation system has requirements on its performance mainly in four
aspects: displacement of the optic in KAGRA’s observation band, 1/e decay time
of the resonant modes, root mean square (RMS) of the velocity of the optic, and
RMS of the residual angular fluctuation of the optic. The suspension system has to
damp the resonant mode enough as well as to reduce the motion of the optic due to
the seismic motion and noise induced from the damping control. The displacement
of the optic has to be recovered back to the state where the interferometer can be
operated soon enough even after the large disturbance caused by earthquakes or failure
of interferometer control. During the alignment of the interferometer, the orientation
of the each optic has to be controlled so that the laser beam stably hits at almost the
center of the optic at 3 km away. Also, the optics have to have small enough momentum
to acquire the control of the optical cavity. If an optic swings too fast, the actuators

cannot capture the optic at an optical resonance point while the optic passes through.
Table 1 is a summary of the requirements on the PR mirrors. Since the requirement
on the displacement of the PR mirrors are about 300 times larger than that of
the SR mirrors [8, 9], Type-Bp suspension is reasonably compact and simple. The
commissioning of the suspension control is much simpler than other suspensions since
the Type-Bp suspension does not have an IP requiring careful tuning of its control
filters [10]. On the other hand, there is difficulty in reducing the damping time
and angular fluctuation down below the requirement without an IP. According to a
simulation study [10], the modes where the whole chain swings as a pendulum (see
figure 3) cannot be damped with the suspension, whereas it can be damped using the
effect of its back-action on the IPs as in the case of Type-B.

Figure 3. (Color online) Whole chain mode of the initial suspension of the Type-Bp
system. This mode is difficult to damp since there is no sensors and actuators that
have sufficient sensitivity and actuation efficiency.

In order to solve the issue, a new compact recoil mass, BFRM, is added around
so called Bottom Filter (BF), which is suspended from the ground independently
from the main chain. The sensors and actuators to monitor and actuate the relative
motion between the BF and its recoil mass can damp the whole chain mode. The

damping control with the recoil mass enable the vibration isolation system to satisfy
the requirements without introducing complicated mechanism nor control system that
requires a lot of effort on its tuning.

the red dashed line is the BFRM, the new damping mechanism.

The payload composed of the bottom two stages including optic has the same
mechanism as the suspension of the Type-B system as described in [10], [6] and [11].
The payload is suspended from the BF stage that is suspended by a single maraging
steel rod from another GAS filter, called the standard filter (SF). The BFRM, the newly
added recoil mass, is suspended around the BF (See figure 5). It is an aluminum ring
with about 57 kg weight suspended by three maraging rods from the ground. Each
stage of the pendulum is surrounded by rigid structures called earthquake stops (EQ
stops), in order to protect the suspension from serious damage caused by shocks such
as one given during the installation procedure. All the suspensions and EQ stops are
suspended from the traverser stage that has a set of motors to adjust the position and
the orientation of the suspension in the horizontal plane. The traverser is attached on
the rigid frame inside the vacuum chamber, and is fixed on the ground independently
of the vacuum chamber.

the corresponding CAD drawing (right). The green, yellow, and red parts are the EQ
stop, the BFRM, and the sensor and actuator units for BF damping attached on the
BF, respectively.

3.2. Sensors and actuators
Each stage has sensors and actuators in order to control the suspension. The actuators
are used for the interferometer controls as well as local damping control. For the
local active damping control, several types of the sensors are employed: optical lever
(Oplev) [12], an unit of a shadow sensor and a coil-magnet actuator, called Optical
Sensor and Electro-Magnetic actuator (OSEM) [13], and two types of Linear Variable
Differential Transformer (LVDT). Each stage is activelly controlled using coil-magnet
actuators attached on each stage.
While the sensors and actuators used for the payload and the GAS filters are
also same as the Type-B suspensions [10, 6, 11], the wide-range LVDTs are newly
employed for the damping on the BF and the BFRM stages (See figure 6). The relative
position between the BFRM and the BF is adjustable only by changing the height of
three suspension points. Therefore, it is important for the sensor-actuator units to be
functional even when the operating point is off from the nominal position by several
millimeters as well as to have a mechanism to adjust the position of the parts attached
on the BFRM. They have one small coil as a primary coil which introduces modulated
current, and two large coils as secondary coils which receive the induced electromotive
force from the primary coil. The two coils are connected so that the induced current is
ideally canceled out when the primary coil is at the center of the two coils. Also, the
two secondary coils are used as actuator coils. The actuation current and the induced
current are combined at the analog circuit. They do not disturb each other in our
purpose since we actuate the suspension only at frequencies lower than 30 Hz, while the
induced current stays at the modulation frequencies, such as 10 kHz.
4. Measured performance
Three Type-Bp suspensions for PRM, PR2, and PR3 optics were assembled and installed
in the KAGRA site. They have already been utilized for the operation of a 3-km arm

Michelson interferometer with a cryogenic test mass in May 2018, and have showed
stable performance [14]. In the following sections, measured characteristics of the PR3
are described as an example of an individual performance of the Type-Bp system.
4.1. Damping control
The damping control loops are engaged at all the stages for all controllable degrees
of freedom as shown in figure 7. In order to minimize sensor noise introduced by the
damping control, the damping servo filters are adjusted so that the open loop gain is
larger than one only at around their resonant frequencies. They have large control gain
at the resonant frequencies by utilizing the large mechanical gain while they have low
gain at higher frequencies. Other than the damping control, stages labeled as DC in
figure 7 are controlled only at frequencies lower than 0.1 Hz. These loops are designed
in order to compensate long-term drift of position and orientation of the mirror. The
feedback loops are closed in each DOFs at each stage, except for the Oplev. The Oplev
loop has the hierarchical control system in order to control the orientation of the optic.
The Oplev signal is fed back to the IM OSEMs that has larger actuation efficiency than
the coil-magnet actuators at the optic stage at frequencies lower than 0.1 Hz in order
to compensate drift. The resonant peaks are suppressed by the feedback control from
the Oplev to the optic similarly as other stages.
The suspensions are controlled by the digital system in the KAGRA site. All the
signals are sampled and sent to a real-time computer via the analog-to-digital converters.
After proper servo filters are applied on the signals, the feedback signals are generated

schematics of the shape of the control filters.

at the digital-to-analog converters.
4.2. Damping time
Figure 8 shows how fast the amplitude of the each resonant mode decreases. The
amplitude of each mode should decay at a rate of e−t/τe , where t is time, τe is decay
time that is required for the amplitude to be decreased by 1/e. The Squares, triangles,
and circles show the decay time τe without any controls, ones with damping controls
except the BF/BFRM controls, and ones with all the damping loops on, respectively.
Note that a decay time of mode of differential motion of the optic and the RM in y-axis
is not plotted in figure 8. It is only the resonant mode that cannot be observed with the
local sensors. It should not affect the interferometer operation since motion in y-axis
less affects the interferometer alignment, and also since there is less risk to excite this
mode due to rack of actuation mechanism.
It shows that some resonant modes cannot be damped within one minute without
the BF damping system. Those modes are difficult to be observed and to be actuated
by the sensors and actuators other than BF LVDT actuator units. While some of such
resonant modes are motion of the BFRM that do not affect the optic motion, the whole
chain mode at 0.45 Hz, for example, cannot efficiently be damped only by IM even

though IM OSEMs can observe its resonance.
4.3. Residual velocity
Figure 9 shows the residual velocity of the optic measured with the Oplev. The velocity
of the optic in the x direction is derived by using the effect that the displacement of the
optic in the Oplev signal depends on gouy phase of the beam [12].
The green, blue, and red lines correspond to the velocity without any damping
control, with damping on except for the BF stage, and with all damping control on,
respectively. The dashed lines with each of the colors represent the RMS velocity of the
optic with the corresponding damping control accumulated below 100 Hz.
Although the only displacement of the optic observed is its resonant motion due
to the oplev sensing noise, the measurement still provides a useful estimate of the
RMS velocity. It is known that the motion at frequencies other than the resonant
frequencies, contribute in small amount according to the transfer functions from seismic
motion to the optic displacement. The total RMS of the optic velocity is 3.56 µm/sec
without any damping, 2.11 µm/sec with damping control except for the BF stage, and
1.96 × 10−1 µm/sec with all the damping on.
The resonant peak at 0.45 Hz caused by the whole chain mode is not suppressed
completely even with the BF damping system, the BFRM that is about 57 kg weight
is much lighter than the BF with the weight of about 100 kg. Therefore, the BFRM

follows the vibration of the main chain while some of the energy in the mode can be
dissipated.
Note that dips at around 0.65 Hz are due the over-damping of the control loop
on the optic stage. The open loop gain has large gain at 0.65 Hz that is the resonant
frequency of the pendulum mode of the optic. The dip is observed in the closed loop
signal since the motion caused by the resonant mode is small compared to the open loop
gain.

Figure 9. (Color online) Residual velocity of the optic monitored by the lengthsensing Oplev. The green, blue, and red lines correspond to the velocity without any
damping control, with damping on except for the BF stage, and with all damping
control on, respectively. The dashed lines with each colors represent the RMS velocity
accumulated below 100 Hz.

4.4. Residual angular fluctuation
The angular fluctuation of the optic are shown in figures 10 and 11. As well as figure 9,
the green, blue, and red lines correspond to the angular fluctuation without any damping
control, with damping on except for the BF stage, and with all damping control on,
respectively. The dashed lines with each of the colors represent the corresponding RMS
angular fluctuation below 100 Hz.
Without the newly designed BF damping system, the angular fluctuation in pitch
can be suppressed from 3.56 × 10 µrad to 2.34 µrad, which does not satisfy the
requirement, while it can be suppressed to 1.36 × 10−1 µrad by employing the BF
damping. It shows the pitch motion caused by the whole pendulum mode at around
0.45 Hz is effectively damped by the BF damping system.

The yaw angular fluctuation that is 3.43 µrad without any damping decreased
from 1.38 µrad to less than 1.11 µrad by turning the BF damping on. The first yaw
mode where the whole chain rotates without any nodes at around 0.1 Hz is suppressed
efficiently by the BF damping. Note that the RMS of the yaw fluctuation with all the
damping loops on shows an upper limit of the actual residual motion, since the Oplev
sensing noise is too large to observe the residual resonant peaks.

4.5. Vibration isolation performance
Using the rigid body model based on the measured response of the suspension, the
seismic motion, and measured sensor noise, the fluctuation of the optic in x direction is
calculated. the motion of the optic at higher frequencies than the resonant frequencies
cannot be measured by the local sensors due to the sensor noise and the seismic motion
of the sensor. Figure 12 is an estimated fluctuation of the PR3 optic. The green line is
the total displacement of the PR3 optic, and the black dash line is the requirement with
a safety factor of 10. It shows that the BF LVDTs have low enough noise level for PR3.
The residual displacement above 10 Hz is dominated by the IM OSEM sensor noise.

5. Summary
The compact vibration isolation system with proper damping control system for power
recycling mirrors was realized in KAGRA. While it has relatively compact system as tall
as 1.7 m, it was designed to have sufficient vibration isolation performance and damping
control system. The new compact and simple damping system called BFRM is effective
in terms of the damping control.
Three suspensions were installed as PRM, PR2, and PR3 in the KAGRA tunnel,
and operated as parts of the 3-km Michelson interferomter. Individually measured
performance of the suspension is also proved to satisfy the requirements from the
interferometer operation. The 1/e decay time is less than 40 sec for all the resonant
modes, and the residual angular fluctuation is less than 1 µrad. Also, the residual RMS
of the optic velocity is as slow as 0.2 µm/sec, such that the momentum of the optic is
small enough for lock acquisition of the optical cavity. Furthermore, the fluctuation of
the optics caused by the seismic motion and sensor noise introduced by the damping
control is also calculated to be small enough to achive the target sensitivity of KAGRA.
