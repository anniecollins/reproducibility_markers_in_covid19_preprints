Abstract
The exponential mechanism is a fundamental tool of Differential Privacy (DP) due to its strong privacy
guarantees and flexibility. We study its extension to settings with summaries based on infinite dimensional
outputs such as with functional data analysis, shape analysis, and nonparametric statistics. We show
that one can design the mechanism with respect to a specific base measure over the output space, such
as a Guassian process. We provide a positive result that establishes a Central Limit Theorem for the
exponential mechanism quite broadly. We also provide an apparent negative result, showing that the
magnitude of the noise introduced for privacy is asymptotically non-negligible relative to the statistical
estimation error. We develop an -DP mechanism for functional principal component analysis, applicable
in separable Hilbert spaces. We demonstrate its performance via simulations and applications to two
datasets.

Introduction

Data privacy and security have become increasingly critical to society as we continue to collect troves of
highly individualized data. In the last decade, we have seen the emergence of new tools and perspectives on
data privacy such as Differential Privacy (DP), introduced by Dwork et al. (2006), which provides a rigorous
and interpretable definition of privacy. Within the DP framework, numerous tools have been developed that
achieve DP in a variety of applications and contexts, such as empirical risk minimization (Chaudhuri et al.,
2011; Kifer et al., 2012), linear and logistic regression (Chaudhuri & Monteleoni, 2009; Zhang et al., 2012; Yu
et al., 2014; Sheffet, 2017; Awan & Slavković, 2018), hypothesis testing (Vu & Slavkovic, 2009; Wang et al.,
2015; Gaboardi et al., 2016; Awan & Slavković, 2018; Canonne et al., 2018), network data (Karwa et al.,
2016; Karwa & Slavković, 2016), and density estimation (Wasserman & Zhou, 2010), to name a few.
One of the most flexible and convenient DP tools is the exponential mechanism, introduced by McSherry
& Talwar (2007), which often fits in naturally with estimation techniques from statistics and machine learning.
Many estimation procedures can be described as maximizing a particular objective or utility function:
where ξ : Y → R,

b̂ = arg max ξ(b),
b∈Y

or, equivalently, minimizing a loss function such as least squares or the negative log-likelihood. The exponential
mechanism provides a sanitized version of b̂ by using the objective function directly to add noise. The
sanitized estimate, b̃, is drawn from a density, f (b), that is proportional to
n 
o
f (b) ∝ exp
ξ(b) ,
2∆
where ∆ captures the sensitivity of the objective function to small perturbations in the data, and  is the
desired privacy budget (details in Sections 2 and 3). The idea behind this mechanism is to assign higher
density values to regions with higher utility. The constant ∆/ adjusts the spread of the density; as the
sensitivity increases or as the privacy budget decreases (meaning a decreased disclosure risk), the variability
of b̃ increases. A major advantage of such an approach is its use of the objective function from the non-private
estimate, b̂, which naturally promotes perturbations with higher utility and discourages those with poor
utility.

In this paper we study the exponential mechanism, especially as it pertains to functional data analysis,
shape analysis, and nonparametric statistics, where one has a (potentially) infinite dimensional output. We
show that the exponential mechanism can be applied in such settings, but requires a specified base measure
over the output space Y. We propose using a Gaussian process as the base measure, as these distributions
are well studied and easy to implement. We derive a Central Limit Theorem (CLT) for the exponential
mechanism quite broadly, however, this result also implies that the magnitude of the noise introduced for
privacy is of the same order as the statistical estimation error. In particular, we show that in most natural
settings the exponential mechanism does not add an asymptotically negligible noise, even in finite dimensions.
Using our approach, we develop an -DP mechanism for functional principal component analysis (FPCA),
which extends the method of Chaudhuri et al. (2013) to separable Hilbert spaces. We show that a Gaussian
process base measure enables us to modify the Gibbs sampling procedure of Chaudhuri et al. (2013) to this
functional setting. We illustrate the performance of our private FPCA mechansim through simulations, and
apply our mechanism to both the Berkeley growth study from the fda package Ramsay et al. (2018) and the
Diffusion Tensory Imaging (DTI) dataset from the refund package Goldsmith et al. (2018).
Related Work: This work most directly builds off of Hall et al. (2013) and Mirshani et al. (2017),
which develop the first techniques for producing fully functional releases under DP. Another work in this
direction is Alda & Rubinstein (2017), in which they use Bernstein polynomial approximations to release
functions. Recently, Smith et al. (2018) applied the techniques of Hall et al. (2013) to privatize gaussian
process regression. In their setup, they assume that the predictors are public knowledge, and use this
information to carefully tailor the sanitization noise.
There have been a few accuracy bounds regarding exponential mechanism, which can be found in Section
3.4 of Dwork & Roth (2014). However, these results bound the loss in terms of the objective function, rather
than in terms of the private release. Wasserman & Zhou (2010) also develop some accuracy bounds for the
exponential mechanism, focusing on mean and density
√ estimation. They show that in the mean estimation
problem, the exponential mechanism introduces O(1/ n) noise. Our asymptotic analysis of the exponential
mechanism agrees in this setting, and extends this result to a large class of objective functions.
Our application to FPCA extends the private PCA method proposed in Chaudhuri et al. (2013). There
have been other approaches to private multivariate PCA. Blum et al. (2005) were one of the first to develop a
DP procedure for principal components, which is a postprocessing of a noisy covariance matrix. Dwork et al.
(2014) follow the same approach and develop bounds for this algorithm; they also develop an online algorithm
for private PCA. Jiang et al. (2013) modify this approach by both introducing noise in the covariance matrix
as well as to the projection. Imtiaz & Sarwate (2016) also add noise to the covariance matrix, but use a
Wishart distribution rather than normal or Laplace noise.
Organization: In Section 2, we review the necessary background of Differential Privacy. In Section
3, we recall the exponential mechanism and give asymptotic results for the performance of the exponential
mechanism in both finite and infinite dimensional settings. In Section 4 we show how the exponential
mechanism can be applied to produce Functional Principal Components, and in Section 5 we give a Gibbs
sampler for this mechanism. In Section 6, we study the performance of the private principal components
on both simulated data and on the Berkeley and DTI datasets. Finally, we give our concluding remarks in
Section 7.

Differential Privacy

In this section we provide a brief overview of differential privacy (DP). Throughout, we let X denote an
arbitrary set, which represents a particular population, and let X n be the n-fold Cartesian product, which
represents the collection of all possible samples that could be observed. We begin by defining the Hamming
Distance between two databases.
Definition 2.1 (Hamming Distance). The bivariate function δ : X n × X n → Z, which maps δ(X, Y ) :=
#{i | Xi 6= Yi }, is called the Hamming Distance on X n .
It is easy to verify that δ is a metric on X n . If δ(X, Y ) = 1 we call X and Y adjacent.
Since we are focused on infinite dimensional objects, we define Differential Privacy broadly for any
statistical summary. In particular, suppose that f : X n → Y represents a summary of X n , and let F be a

2

σ-algebra of subsets of Y so that the pair (Y, F ) is a measurable space. From a probabilistic perspective, a
privacy mechanism is a family of probability measures {µX : X ∈ X n } over Y. We can now define what we
mean when we say the mechanism satisfies -DP. While DP was originally introduced in Dwork et al. (2006),
Definition 2.2 is similar to the versions given in Wasserman & Zhou (2010) and Kifer & Lin (2010).
Definition 2.2 (Differential Privacy: Dwork et al., 2006). A privacy mechanism {µX : X ∈ X n } satisfies
-Differential Privacy (-DP) if for all B ∈ F and adjacent X, X 0 ∈ X n ,
µX (B) ≤ µX 0 (B) exp().
From Definition 2.2, we see that, for an -DP mechanism, µX and µX 0 must be equivalent measures (i.e.
they agree on sets of measure zero) if δ(X, X 0 ) = 1. By transitivity, it follows that µX and µY are equivalent
measures for any X, Y ∈ X n . By the Radon-Nikodym Theorem, we can always therefore interpret DP in
terms of densities with respect to a common base measure, ν (if needed, one can always take ν = µX for an
arbitrary X ∈ X n ).
Proposition 2.3. Let M = {µX | X ∈ X n } be a privacy mechanism over a measurable space (Y, F ). Then
M achieves -DP if and only if there exists a base measure ν such that µX  ν for all X ∈ X n and the
densities {fX : X ∈ X n } (Radon-Nikodym derivatives) of the µX (with respect to ν) satisfy
fX (b) ≤ fX 0 (b) exp(),
ν-almost everywhere and for all adjacent X, X 0 ∈ X n .
Proof. The reverse direction is given in Remark 1 from Hall et al. (2013), though we provide the argument
here again for completeness. Let B ∈ F and X, X 0 ∈ X n be adjacent elements. Then

fX 0 (b)
µX (B) =

fX (b) dν(b) ≤
exp()fX 0 (b) dν(b) = exp()µX 0 (b).
B
B fX 0 (b)
B
Going in the other direction we will use a proof by contradiction. Assume that M is an -DP mechanism.
Recall that two measures are equivalent if they agree on the zero sets, thus, as we have said, the measures in a
DP mechanism must all be equivalent. So, we can assume that all of the measures have a density with respect
to some common base measure, ν, which, without loss of generality, we can take to be one of the elements of
M . Now assume that there exists a set B and some adjacent databases X, X 0 such that fX (b) > fX 0 (b) exp()
for all b ∈ B and that ν(B) > 0. Then this would imply the strict inequality
Z
Z
µX (B) =
fX (b) dν(b) > exp()
fX 0 (b) dν(b) = exp()µX 0 (B),

which is a contradiction, and thus the claim holds.
Interpreting DP in terms of densities is common in the DP literature (e.g. Dwork & Roth, 2014; Kifer
et al., 2012), however, we could not find a reference for the precise statement and proof, especially for the
reverse implication.

Exponential Mechanism

One of the earliest mechanisms designed to satisfy -DP, is the exponential mechanism, introduced by
McSherry & Talwar (2007). It uses an objective or utility function, which in practice, can be the same
objective function used for a (non-private) statistical or machine learning analysis, thus making it especially
easy to link DP with existing inferential tools. A simple proof for Proposition 3.1 can be found in McSherry
& Talwar (2007).
Proposition 3.1 (Exponential Mechanism: McSherry & Talwar, 2007). Let (Y, F , ν) be a measure space.
Let {ξX : Y → R | X ∈ X n } be a collection of measurable functions. We say that this collection has a finite
sensitivity ∆ξ , if
|ξX (b) − ξX 0 (b)| ≤ ∆ξ < ∞,
3

R
for all adjacent X, X 0 and ν-almost all b. If Y exp(ξX (b)) dν(b) < ∞ for all X ∈ X n , then the collection of
probability measures {µX | X ∈ X n } with densities fX (with respect to ν) satisfying




fX (b) ∝ exp
ξX (b)
2∆ξ
satisfies -DP.
We call the set {ξX | X ∈ X n } the Objective Function, used in the exponential mechanism. Note that
0
in Proposition 3.1, if ν is a finite measure,
R ∆(ξ) < ∞, and ξX (b) is bounded above for all X ∈ X and
ν-almost all b, then one immediately has exp(ξX (b)) dν(b) < ∞. We will exploit this fact later on as our
base measures in infinite dimensions will actually be taken from Gaussian processes, not from any form of
Lebesgue measure.
The exponential mechanism offers a general approach to building DP mechanisms, and in fact, any DP
mechanism can be expressed as an instantiation of the exponential mechanism, by taking the objective
function to be the log-density of the mechanism (McSherry & Talwar, 2007). We remark that the factor of 2
in the exponential mechanism can sometimes be removed (e.g. location families).
Since the solution to many statistical problems can be expressed as the optimizers of some expression, it
is natural to set the objective function in the exponential mechanism to this expression. Often times, such
expressions can be expressed as empirical risks, such as the MLE/MAP estimate (Wang et al., 2015), principal
component analysis (Chaudhuri et al., 2013), and quantiles of one-dimensional statistics (Smith, 2011).
The following result shows that for objective functions of such forms, the noise added by the exponential
mechanism is asymptotically normal.
Theorem 3.2 (Utility of Exp Mech). Assume the observed record, X1 , . . . , Xn , and corresponding sequence
of objective functions ξn (b) := ξX (b), for b ∈ Rd satisfy
1. −n−1 ξn (b) are twice differentiable convex functions and there exists a finite α > 0 such that the
eigenvalues of −n−1 ξn (b)00 are greater than α for all n and b ∈ Rd ;
2. the minimizers satisfy b̂ → b? ∈ Rd and −n−1 ξn (b̂)00 → Σ−1 where Σ is a p × p positive definite matrix;
3. ξn has finite sensitivity ∆, which is constant in n.
Assume the base measure has a bounded, differentiable density g(b) which is strictly positive in a neighborhood
of b? . Then the sanitized value b̃ drawn from the exponential mechanism with privacy parameter  is
asymptotically normal

so the only remaining task is to show that the combined constants behave appropriately. Recall that

The previous√result shows that under common conditions, the noise added by the exponential mechanism
is of order O(1/ n). We know by the theory of M-estimators that the non-private solution to the objective
√
functions b̂ also converges
√ at rate O(1/ n). So, we have that the use of the exponential mechanisim in such
cases preserves the 1/ n convergence rate, but with a sub-optimal asymptotic variance. This means that
asymptotically, to achieve the same performance as the non-private estimator, the exponential mechanism
requires k times as many samples, where k is some constant larger than 1, which depends on  and ∆.
However, we know that for many problems, it is possible to construct DP mechanisms which only introduce
O(1/n) noise, thus having equivalent asymptotics to the non-private estimator (e.g. Smith, 2011; Awan &
Slavković, 2018). Even though in these settings, the noise is asymptotically negligible, developing accurate
approximations is still a challenge, which Wang et al. (2018) recently tackled.
In the next result, we extend Theorem 3.2 from Rp to Hilbert spaces. However, we currently only consider
base measures which are Gaussian processes.
Theorem 3.3 (Utility of Exp Mech). Suppose that the observed record, X1 , . . . , Xn , and objective function
ξX (b), for b ∈ H satisfy
1. −n−1 ξn (b) are twice differentiable convex functions and there exists a finite α > 0 such that the
eigenvalues of −n−1 ξn (b)00 are greater than α for all n and b ∈ H;
2. the minimizers satisfy b̂ → b? ∈ H and −n−1 ξn (b̂)00−1 → Σ where Σ is positive definite trace class
operator (and convergence is wrt this space);
3. ξn has finite sensitivity ∆, which is constant in n.

Remark 3.4. The requirement that C −1 Σ is bounded implies that the base measure is “rougher” than the
00
asymptotic distribution of b̂. One way to view the assumption on ξX
is through tightness. In particular, if
one assumed only that Σ was bounded, then the sequence of measures need not be tight and thus one does
not get convergence in the “strong topology” in H (Billingsley, 2013; Chen & White, 1998, Remark 3.3).
However, one could still obtain convergence of properly normalized continuous linear functionals.
Example 3.5. Consider X1 , . . . , Xn ∈ H are drawn from a Gaussian process with mean µX and covariance
operator CX . Consider estimating µX using the target function
−ξX (b) =

n
X

kXi − bk2 .

i=1

Assume that the kXi k ≤ 1 and thus we need only consider kbk ≤ 1. In that case, the sensitivity is bounded
by 4. However, for this target function the exponential mechanism will not be asymptotically Gaussian (in
the strong topology). If we consider the second derivative we have
00
−ξX
(b) = 2nI,
00
and thus (−ξX
(b)/n)−1 = (1/2)I, which is not a nuclear operator in infnite dimensions. However, if instead
we consider the penalized version

−ξX (b) =

n
X

kXi − bk2 + nλkbk2C ,

i=1

where kbk2C = hb, C −1 bi, then the sensitivity is the same, but the second derivative is now
00
−ξX
(b) = 2nI + 2nλC −1 ,

which satisfies the assumptions of Theorem 3.3. In this case, we can now take our Guassian mechanism to be
a mean zero Gaussian process with covariance C.
00
We stress that, in finite samples, there is no issue related to privacy even when ξX
(b)−1 is not nuclear
since we are assuming the mechanism is defined using a value probability distribution as the base measure.
What the previous results and this example illustrate is that there is a price to pay for using such a flexible
mechanism. In the “good” case, when the assumptions of Theorem 3.3 are met, one has an asymptotically
non-negligle noise, but in the ”bad” case, the noise can be even larger, since the covariance operator can blow
up.

DP Functional Principal Components

In this section, we apply the exponential mechanism to the problem of producing private functional principal
component analysis (FPCA).
Let (H, h·, ·i) be a Hilbert Space. Let X ∈ Hn be such that its components satisfy kXi k ≤ 1 for all
i = 1, . . . , n. Call Ŝ(X) the k-dimensional subspace of H given by the span of the first k principal components

6

of X. Let PŜ(X) : H → H denote the projection operator of H onto Ŝ(X). We can write PŜ(X) as the solution
to the optimization problem

where Pk is the set of projection operators P : H → H of rank k. Equivalently, we can write
PŜ(X) = arg max

P ∈Pk

n

kP Xi k2 .

i=1

More specifically, in this section, we develop a set of probability measures M on Pk , indexed by Hn , which
satisfy -DP, and such that a random element P from µX ∈ M is “close” to PŜ(X) .
n
Our approach follows
Pn that of Chaudhuri et al. (2013). We take our objective function to be ξ : X ×Pk → R
defined by ξX (P ) =P i=1 kP Xi k2 . Note that ∆ξ = 1, since kP Xi k2 ≤ kXi k2 ≤ 1 for any P ∈ Pk and any
n
i = 1, . . . , n. Since i=1 kP Xi k2 ≤ n, for any probability measure ν on Pk , the class of densities on Pk
with respect to ν given by
!
n

fX (P ) ∝ exp
kP Xi k , satisfies -DP.
2 i=1
If H is finite dimensional, then Pk is a compact subset of the space of linear operators (e.g. matrices
when H = Rp ). In that case, there exists a uniform distribution on Pk . In Chaudhuri et al. (2013), they
implement the exponential mechanism as above, with respect to the uniform distribution on Pk .
For arbitrary H, Pk is not compact, so we must find another base measure on Pk . To understand our
proposed construction, we again consider the finite dimensional H. Let P ∼ Unif(Pk ), that is P is drawn
iid

from the uniform distribution on Pk . Let V1 , . . . , Vk ∼ N (0, I), be iid multivariate normal with mean zero
d

and identity covariance matrix. Then P = Projection(span(V1 , . . . , Vk )) (since Vk is invariant under rotations).
iid

From this factorization, a natural extension for arbitrary H becomes clear. Let V1 , . . . , Vk ∼ NH (0, Σ), be iid
Gaussian processes in H with zero mean and covariance operator Σ. Note that Σ must be positive definite and
trace class, which excludes the identity when H is infinite dimensional (Bogachev, 1998). We can also tailor
Σ to instill certain properties such as smoothness or periodicity. Then set P = Projection(span(V1 , . . . , Vk )).
This procedure induces in a probability measure on Pk , which we call ν.
Theorem 4.1. Let H be a real separable Hilbert Space and Pk the collection of all k-dimensional projection operators over H. Let ν be the probability measure over Pk induced by the transformation Projection(span(V1 , . . . , Vk )),
where Vi ∈ H are iid Gaussian process with mean 0 and covariance operator Σ. Let M be the class of
probability measures on Pk with densities

As we see in the next section, we will represent the output of Theorem 4.2 as an arbitrary basis for a
k-dimensional subspace Se of H, which can then be assembled into a projection operator as needed.
Remark 4.3. In many cases we can interpret Σ as instilling some particular structure on P or the Vi . For
example, if H = L2 [0, 1], then we could define Σ using the kernel of an RKHS. The kernel could then be
chosen so that Se have a certain number of derivatives as many Sobelev spaces are RKHS as well (Berlinet &
Thomas-Agnan, 2011), which is often a natural assumption.

PCA continued: Sampling

In the previous section, we developed a set of -DP probability measures for arbitrary Hilbert Spaces. However,
for these to be of use to us, we need to be able to sample from these probability distributions. As is common
in FDA (Ramsay & Silverman, 2005; Kokoszka & Reimherr, 2017) we use finite dimensional approximations
via basis expansions for computation.
Let b1 , b2 , . . . be an orthonormal basis for H. We will work in the m-dimensional subspace Hm =
span(b1 , . . . , bm ). Given our observed values Xi ∈ H, call Xij = hXi , bj i for i = 1, . . . , n and j = 1, . . . , m.
We arrange these real values in an n × m matrix X = (Xij ). Next, let Σ be a trace class covariance operator
on H. Write Σij = hbi , Σbj i for i, j = 1, . . . , m. We put these values in an m × m matrix Σ = (Σij ), which is
a positive definite matrix in Rm×m . In this setup, we then draw (V1 , . . . , Vk ) ∈ Hm . Call Vij = hVi , bj i, and
arrange these values into a real-valued matrix V = (Vij ) We then draw from the density f (V ), with respect
to Lebesgue measure on Rk×m , which is proportional to


tr(X > XV (V > V )−1 V > − V > Σ−1 V )) .
exp

In fact, we can obtain a more convenient form for sampling. Since we only need the span of V , we can
condition on the columns of V being orthonormal. The density f (V | orthonormal), with respect to the
uniform measure on the set of orthonormal matrices in Rm×k , is proportional to

which is an instance of the Matrix-Bingham-Von-Mises distribution, for which an efficient Gibbs sampler is

Numerical Studies

In this section we assess the performance of the exponential mechanism for private FPCA, as developed in
Sections 4 and 5 on both simulated and real data.

6.1

Simulation Study

For our simulation study, we generated data on a grid of 100 evenly spaced points on [0, 1] using the
Karhunen-Loeve expansion with Gaussian noise added:
p
X
1
Xi (tik ) = µ(tik ) +
U u (t ) + εik ,
2 ij j ik
j
j=1

for i = 1, . . . , n, k = 1, . . . , 100. The uj (t) are the true functional principal components, εik are independent
errors sampled from the Gaussian distribution N (0, 1), and scores Uij are sampled from N (0, 0.1). Note that
for each scenario we re-scale the Xi so that ||Xi ||2 < 1 for i = 1, ..., n.
The uj (t) are comprised of Fourier basis functions and to fully explore the effectiveness of this approach,
we vary the sample size n, privacy budget , and repeat each scenario 10 times. Data is generated using
p = 21 true components and additional weights were placed on the fourth term in the Fourier expansion,
creating the overall shape shown in Figure 1. We release only k = 1 components.

and  = 1

of the mechanism.
We also specify m, the number of orthonormal basis functions bi , when restricting the functional
observations to a finite dimensional space and Σ, a trace class covariance operator on H. It is common to
take m to be some sufficiently large value, usually around 40-50, and for our simulation scenarios we have
m = 40. The choice of Σ can vary depending on what structures one may want to induce on the functions
(i.e. the number of derivatives). For our choice of Σ, we take it to be a diagonal matrix with Σii = i−3 , which
corresponds to requiring that the Vi are continuous. Given that the data is periodic, we chose to use the
Fourier basis functions as bi . Finally, recall there is an efficient Gibbs sampler for this approach Hoff (2009),
which has been implemented in the rstiefel package Hoff & Franks (2018) in R. This also requires a fixed
number of iterations as burn-in prior to starting the procedure. Following the computational experiments in
Chaudhuri et al. (2013), we used 20,000 iterations and had similar convergence results.
We provide two measurements of performance to compare the resulting space of orthogonal projection
operators. The first compares the ratio of variability accounted for between the private and non-private
estimates of the k functional principal components. More explicitly,
0≤

||X T P̃ X||2F
||X T P̂ X||2F

≤ 1,

where || · ||F is the Frobenius norm, P̃ is the projection onto the span of V drawn from the mechanism in
Theorem 4.2, and P̂ the the non-private solution to (1).
The second measure gives an indication of how close the range of P̃ is to P̂ :
0≤

1
||P̃ − P̂ ||2F ≤ k.
2

If the range of P̃ and P̂ agree in h dimensions and are orthogonal in k − h dimensions, then this measure
gives the value k − h. So this can be interpreted as roughly the number of dimensions that P̃ and P̂ disagree.
We summarize the results in Figures 2a and 2b over a range of sample size n and privacy budget . Note
that, as expected, larger sample sizes can preserve utility (in terms of the two measurements described

component for one instance of a scenario with a sample size of n = 500, and n = 5000, seen in Figures 3a
and 3b. The last 100 Gibbs updates are given as well, demonstrating the variability in each sample size. Note
that even with a privacy budget of  = 1 and relatively low sample size, the overall shape is captured, but the
variance is reduced when n = 5000.

6.2

Applications

For the real data application, we applied our procedure to two data sets, the Berkeley growth study from the
fda package Ramsay et al. (2018), and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) from the refund package Goldsmith
et al. (2018). The Berkely data has the heights of 93 children at 31 time points with ages ranging from 1-18.
DTI gives fractional anisotropy (FA) tract profiles for the corpus callosum (CCA) the right corticospinal tract
(RCST) for patients with Multiple Sclerosis as well as controls. We focus on the cca data, which includes 382
patients measured at 93 equally spaced locations along the CCA.
Results are summarized in Tables 1 and 2 when releasing 1-3 principal components across a range of
privacy budgets and averaging the performance measurements over 100 repetitions of our procedure. For each
data set we selected the Gaussian kernel for Σ with a smoothness parameter that requires m = 5 eigenvalues
to explain >99% of variation. Its corresponding eigenfunctions were selected for the orthonormal basis bi .
Our approach is more effective over the DTI data set, which may be due to the true variation explained by
the non-private components. For DTI the cumulative variation is .77, .86, and .93 for the top 1, 2, and 3
components respectively, while Berkeley has 0.82, 0.95, and 0.98. When things are too “simple”, necessary
deviations for privacy show more loss in variation explained compared to the non-private estimates. Overall,
this still demonstrates the effectiveness of our procedure under different types of real data with smaller sample
sizes.

Discussion

In this paper, we studied the exponential mechanism in the setting of separable Hilbert spaces. We showed
that generally when the objective is an empirical risk function, the exponential mechanism has a CLT implying
that asymptotically non-negligible noise is introduced. Since the exponential mechanism is popularly used,
this result demands the following question: what properties of the objective function guarantee asymptotically
negligible noise?
Through our simulations and applications, we found that the choice of Σ can have a significant impact on

the result of the private FPCA analysis. In particular, Σ can be rescaled by any positive constant, which
affects the smoothing but does not change the interpretation in terms of number of derivatives. While our
approach requires that Σ is chosen before seeing the data, it would be preferable to have a method of learning
Σ within the DP procedure. Future researchers should investigate effective methods of tuning parameters
under DP.
In the data applications, we found that counter-intuitively, our DP FPCA approach performs better when
there is more variability in the data. Perhaps this is because our measures of performance are comparing
the DP estimates to the non-private estimates, and the variability hurts both. It would be worth while
to investigate this further to better understand how variability in the data affects the performance of DP
methods.
