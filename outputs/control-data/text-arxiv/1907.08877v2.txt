Generation of circularly-polarized (CP) and linearly-polarized (LP) γ-rays via the single-shot interaction of
an ultraintense laser pulse with a spin-polarized counterpropagating ultrarelativistic electron beam has been
investigated in nonlinear Compton scattering in the quantum radiation-dominated regime. For the process
simulation a Monte Carlo method is developed which employs the electron-spin-resolved probabilities for
polarized photon emissions. We show efficient ways for the transfer of the electron polarization to the highenergy photon polarization. In particular, multi-GeV CP (LP) γ-rays with polarization of up to about 95% can
be generated by a longitudinally (transversely) spin-polarized electron beam, with a photon flux meeting the
requirements of recent proposals for the vacuum birefringence measurement in ultrastrong laser fields. Such
high-energy, high-brilliance, high-polarization γ-rays are also beneficial for other applications in high-energy
physics, and laboratory astrophysics.

Polarization is a crucial intrinsic property of a γ-photon.
In astrophysics the γ-photon polarization provides detailed
insight into the γ-ray emission mechanism and on properties
of dark matter [1, 2]. Highly-polarized high-energy γ-rays are
a versatile tool in high-energy [3] and nuclear physics [4]. For
instance, polarized γ-rays of tens of MeV can be used to excite
polarization-dependent photofission of the nucleus in the giant
dipole resonance [5], while polarized γ-rays of up to GeV play
crucial roles for the meson-photoproduction [6].
Recently, several proposals have been put forward to detect
vacuum birefringence in ultrastrong laser fields, probing it with
circularly-polarized (CP) or lineraly-polarized (LP) γ-photons
of high-energies (larger than MeV and up to several GeV),
see [7–11], taking advantage of the fact that the QED vacuum
nonlinearity is significantly enhanced for high-energy photons.
As proved in [11], the use of CP rather than LP probe photons
reduces the measurement time of vacuum birefringence and
vacuum dichroism by two orders of magnitude.
The common ways of producing high-energy polarized γrays are linear Compton scattering [12–16] and bremsstrahlung
[17–20]. The advantage of the former is that it employs unpolarized electron beams, and the emitted γ-photon polarization
is determined by the driving laser polarization, while in the latter the spin of the scattering electron determines the γ-photon
polarization [21]. However, in linear Compton scattering the
electron-photon collision luminosity is rather low. The collision luminosity can be increased by using high-intensity lasers,
but in this case the interaction regime moves into the nonlinear regime, when the radiation formation length is much
smaller than the laser wavelength. Then during the photon
formation the laser field does not vary much and the emission
process acquires similarity to bremsstrahlung. Namely, in the
nonlinear regime the circular polarization of the emitted γphoton requires longitudinally spin-polarized (LSP) electrons.

Nevertheless, the nonlinear regime of Compton scattering is
beneficial for the generation of polarized γ-photons, because
the polarization is enhanced at high γ-photon energies [12],
and the typical emitted photon energy is increased in the quantum nonlinear regime, becoming comparable with the electron
energy [22, 23]. In the nonlinear regime the relative bandwidth
of emission is increased [24], which is not suitable for photonic applications involving narrow resonances, and stimulated
investigations for the bandwidth reduction, see e.g. [25, 26].
However, vacuum birefringence is not a resonant effect and
its measurement does not require a small γ-photon bandwidth,
but mostly high flux of highly-polarized high-energy photons.
Regarding deficiencies connected with the bremsstrahlung
mechanism, the incoherent bremsstrahlung cannot generate
LP γ-photons, and the scattering angle and emission divergence are both relatively large [27]. Furthermore, for coherent
bremsstrahlung [4, 28], the current density of the impinging
electrons and the radiation flux is limited by the damage threshold of the crystal material [20, 29, 30].
With rapid developments of strong laser techniques, stable
(energy fluctuation ∼ 1%) ultrashort ultraintense laser pulses
can reach peak intensities of the scale of 1022 W/cm2 with
a duration of about tens of femtoseconds [31–36], opening
new ways to generate high-energy high-flux γ-rays [37–42]
in the nonlinear regime of Compton scattering [22, 43–45].
Moderately polarized γ-photons have been predicted in strong
fields in electron-spin-averaged treatment [7, 46, 47]. However,
the polarization properties of radiation are essentially spindependent in the nonlinear regime [27, 48], differing from those
in the linear regime [49–52]), which calls for comprehensive
spin-resolved studies, especially in the most attractive highenergy regime.
In this Letter, the feasibility of generation of polarized ultrashort multi-GeV brilliant γ-rays via nonlinear Compton scattering with spin-polarized electrons is investigated theoretically
(see Fig. 1). High-flux γ-photons with polarization beyond
95% are shown to be feasible in a single-shot interaction, along
with new applications in high-energy, astro- and strong laser
physics. The investigation is based on the developed Monte

tum. The angle-integrated radiation probability of a polarized
photon with a polarized electron reads:

Carlo method for simulation of polarization-resolved radiative
processes in the interaction of an ultrastrong laser beam with
a relativistic spin-polarized electron beam. While the scheme
for CP γ-photons includes an arbitrarily-polarized (AP) laser
pulse colliding with a LSP electron bunch (see Fig. 1(a)), the
scheme for LP γ-photons employs an elliptically-polarized
(EP) laser pulse with a small ellipticity colliding with a transversely spin-polarized (TSP) electron bunch (see Fig. 1(b)).
The spin-dependent radiation reaction in a laser field with a
small ellipticity yields the separation of γ-photons with respect
to the polarization and the enhancement of the polarization
rate.
Let us first introduce our new Monte Carlo method for simulation of polarized γ-photon emissions during the interaction
of polarized relativistic electrons with ultrastrong laser fields.
Photon emissions are treated quantum mechanically, while the
electron dynamics semiclassically. At each simulation step the
photon emission is determined by the total emission probability, and the photon energy by the spectral probability, using
the common algorithms [53–55]. The spin of the electron
after the emission is determined by the spin-resolved emission probabilities according to the algorithm of Ref. [56]; See
more details in [57]. For determination of the photon polarization, we employ the polarized photon emission probabilities
by polarized electrons in the local constant field approximation [22, 27, 58–62], which are derived in the QED operator
method of Baier-Katkov [63]. This approximation is valid in
ultrastrong laser field, when the invariant field parameter is
large a0 ≡ |e|E0 /(mω0 )  1 [22, 27], with laser field amplitude E0 , frequency ω0 , and the electron charge e and mass m.
Relativistic units with c = ~ = 1 are used throughout. The
radiation probabilities are
p characterized by the quantum strong
field parameter χ ≡ |e| −(Fµν pν )2 /m3 [22], where Fµν is the
field tensor, and pν the four-vector of the electron momen-

with a random number Nr ∈ [0, 1]: if W +f i /W f i ≥ Nr , the ξ̂ +
photon state is chosen, otherwise the photon state is set to ξ̂ − ,
see [57]. The Stokes parameters of each emitted photon are
rotated from the instantaneous frame (ξ1 , ξ2 , ξ3 ) defined with
respect to the basis vectors ê1 , ê2 and n̂ to the observation
frame (ξ1(o) , ξ2(o) , ξ3(o) ) defined with respect to the basis vectors
ô1 , ô2 and ô3 , see [57, 64]. Here, W f i ≡ WR F0 is the electronspin-resolved radiation probability averaged by the photon
polarization, cf. [56]. Averaging over the electron spin in
Eq. (1) yields ξ2 = 0, indicating that only LP γ-photons can be

generated with unpolarized electrons, in accordance with [46].
The simulation results for the generation of CP γ-rays are
shown in Fig. 2. A realistic tightly-focused Gaussian LP laser
pulse is used [57, 66, 67], with peak intensity I0 ≈ 3.45 × 1021
W/cm2 (a0 = 50), wavelength λ0 = 1 µm, pulse duration
τ = 10T 0 with period T 0 , and focal radius w0 = 5 µm. The
electron beam counterpropagating with the laser pulse (polar angle θe = 180◦ and azimuthal angle φe = 0◦ ) is fully
LSP with (S x , S y , S z ) = (0, 0, −1). It has a cylindrical form
with radius we = 2λ0 , length Le = 3λ0 and electron number
Ne = 5 × 106 (density ne ≈ 1.33 × 1017 cm−3 ). The electron
density has a transversely Gaussian and longitudinally uniform
distribution. The electron initial kinetic energy is ε0 = 10
GeV, the angular divergence ∆θ = 0.2 mrad, and the energy
spread ∆ε0 /ε0 = 0.06. The emittance of the electron beam
is estimated e ≈ 4 × 10−4 mm·mrad. In our simulations, the
electron-positron pair creations and their further radiations
are taken into account. Such electron bunches are achievable
via laser wakefield acceleration [68, 69] with further radiative polarization [56], or alternatively, via directly wakefield
acceleration of LSP electrons [70].
The angle-resolved number density and average circular polarization of all emitted photons are given in Figs. 2(a) and (b).
The γ-ray pulse duration is determined by the electron bunch
length: τγ ≈ τe ≈ 10 fs [40]. The total number of emitted
γ-photons Nγ at these parameters is about 8.04 × 107 for εγ ≥ 1
MeV and about 1.23 × 107 for εγ ≥ 1 GeV, i.e., Nγ is approximately one order of magnitude larger than Ne , which is in
accordance with the analytical estimation Nγ ∼ αa0 Ne τ/T 0
[22]. For comparison the polarized γ-photon number in the linear Compton scattering is Nγ /Ne ≈ 10−3 at εγ ≈ 56 MeV [14].
The total flux of the γ-rays with εγ ≥ 1 MeV is large due to the
shortness of the pulse: Fγ ≈ 8.04×1021 s−1 . The circular polarization of γ-photon PCP
γ is proportional to the γ-photon energy
εγ (derived from Eqs. (2) and (4)), and significantly higher for
higher photon energies, see Fig. 2(c). Intuitively speaking, the
polarization of emitted γ-photons (photon helicity in the case
of CP) is transfered from the angular momentum (helicity) of
electrons. The larger the average energy of emitted γ-photons,
the smaller the number of emitted photons per electron will
be. As the electron carries a certain helicity, the transferred
average helicity per photon will be larger in the case of smaller
photon number, i.e., in the case of high photon energies. For instance, multi-GeV γ-rays of about 10-GeV, 8-GeV and 6-GeV
can be emitted with circular polarization of about 99%, 94%
and 81%, respectively, and with quite significant brilliances of
about 6.25 × 1018 , 3.94 × 1020 and 1.36 × 1021 photons/(s mm2
mrad2 0.1% BW), respectively, which are comparable with
the brilliance of unpolarized multi-MeV γ-rays obtained in a
recent experiment [37]. The detection of vacuum birefringence
demands Nγ ∼ 107 − 109 CP GeV γ-photons [11]. Taking
into account that LSP electron bunches with Ne ≈ 5 × 108 are
feasible [70], we estimate the number of CP γ-photons at 4
GeV from Fig. 2(c) for such bunches (using ∆εγ /εγ ∼ 0.01)
to reach the required target number for vacuum birefringence
Nγ ≈ 106 in a single-shot interaction.
Figure 2 indicates that the photon polarization is mostly
determined by the incoming electron spin vector Si , where

indicate the results of -10 mrad < θy < 0 (0 < θy < 10 mrad), calculated numerically and analytically (with average χ ≈ 0.7), respectively.
In (d) the basis vectors of the observation frame ô1 , ô2 and ô3 are

the Monte Carlo and the average methods provide identical
results; See Fig. 2(c). During multiple photon emissions the
average spin of the electron beam from the initial longitudinal
direction is gradually oriented along the laser magnetic field
in the transverse direction. This effect reduces the circular
polarization in the case of multiple photon emissions; See
Fig. 2(d).
Generation of LP γ-rays is analyzed in Fig. 3. As an unpolarized (or TSP) electron beam head-on collides with a LP
laser pulse, an average polarization of about 55% can be obtained [57], pointed out already in [7, 46]. However, by harnessing the scheme with an EP laser pulse [56], much higher
polarization can be achieved (see Fig. 1(b)). We focus on the
characteristics of the LP γ-photons in the high-density region
of -10 mrad < θ x,y < 10 mrad (in this region the total radiation
flux Fγ ≈ 2.82 × 1021 s−1 and the average linear polarization

PLP ≈ 55.2%).
Due to the electron-spin-dependence of radiation, namely,
that the radiation probability is larger when the electron spin
is anti-parallel to the rest frame magnetic field [56], the TSP
electrons more probably emit photons in the half cycles with
By < 0. In the given EP laser field, the y-component of the
electron momentum in those half-cycles with By < 0 is positive, py > 0, and the corresponding θy = py /pz < 0, since
pz < 0. Then, the γ-photons are more emitted with θy < 0, see
Fig. 3(c). The relative asymmetry of the photon emission ∆Nγ
corresponds to the relative difference of the radiation probabilities for Si being parallel and anti-parallel to the magnetic field
[56] and is most significant around εγ ≈ 1.2 GeV (εγ /ε0 ≈ 0.6).
Due to radiative electron-spin effects, electrons and γ-photons
are split into two parts along the minor axis (y axis) of the polarization ellipse [56]. In contrast to the case with unpolarized
electrons [7, 46], here at emission angles θy < 0 (θy > 0) the
γ-photon polarization is proportional (inversely proportional)
to its energy, see Fig. 3(d). Thus, specially highly LP γ-rays
can be obtained in the high-energy region.
For θy < 0 in Fig. 3(d), although the average linear polarization of all emitted photons is PLP ≈ 58.3%, the high-energy
photons achieve even higher linear polarization: at photon
energies of about 2 GeV, 1 GeV, 0.4 GeV and 0.2 GeV, the polarizations are of about 95%, 82%, 70% and 64%, respectively,
and the brilliances of about 8.0 × 1016 , 1.2 × 1020 , 2.9 × 1020
and 3.5 × 1020 photons/(s mm2 mrad2 0.1% BW), respectively.
For θy > 0, the sign of polarization is energy dependent [57].
Moreover, the depolarization effect due to multiple photon
emissions in this case is not significant, because subsequent
photon emissions generate LP γ-photons as well, see the blackdotted and green-dashed curves in Fig. 3(d). Furthermore,
using Ne ≈ 3 × 108 [70], LP γ-photons of Nγ ∼ 105 − 106
within 1.015 GeV ≤ εγ ≤ 1.021 GeV (∆εγ /εγ ≈ 0.0059) can
be obtained, which satisfy the requirement (Nγ & 6.4 × 104 ) of
the vacuum birefringence measurement with LP photons [10].
Finally, we have investigated the impact of the laser and
electron beam parameters on the polarization of γ-rays
[57]. Generally, larger energy spread ∆ε0 /ε0 = 0.1, larger
angular divergence of 1 mrad, and different collision angles
θe = 179◦ and φe = 90◦ do not disturb significantly the quality
of γ-ray polarization. In generation of CP and LP γ-rays,
the polarization is robust with respect to the variation of
parameters, e.g., τ, ε0 , a0 and . As the initial polarization
of the electron beam decreases, the polarization of emitted
γ-photons declines as well.
In conclusion, brilliant multi-GeV CP (LP) γ-rays with
polarization up to about 95% are shown to be feasible in the
nonlinear regime of Compton scattering with ultrarelativistic
longitudinally (transversely) spin-polarized electrons. A
photon number applicable for vacuum birefringence measurement in ultrastrong laser fields is achievable in a single-shot
interaction. High degree of linear polarization is obtained due
to the spin-dependent radiation reaction in a laser field with a
small ellipticity, which induces separation of γ-photons with
respect to the polarization.
