Cooperative Information with Application to IV’s Safety∗

Abstract— Use of cooperative information, distributed by
road-side units, offers large potential for intelligent vehicles
(IVs). As vehicle automation progresses and cooperative perception is used to fill the blind spots of onboard sensors, the
question of reliability of the data becomes increasingly important in safety considerations (SOTIF, Safety of the Intended
Functionality).
This paper addresses the problem to estimate the reliability
of cooperative information for in-vehicle use. We propose a
novel method to infer the reliability of received data based on
the theory of Subjective Logic (SL). Using SL, we fuse multiple
information sources, which individually only provide mild cues
of the reliability, into a holistic estimate, which is statistically
sound through an end-to-end modeling within the theory of SL.
Using the proposed scheme for probabilistic SL-based fusion,
IVs are able to separate faulty from correct data samples with
a large margin of safety. Real world experiments show the
applicability and effectiveness of our approach.

I. INTRODUCTION
Being already widely adopted in the avionics industry
and navigation [1], monitoring and assuring systems’ functional performance based on multiple error sources plays
an increasingly important role for intelligent vehicles (IVs)
and is generally termed Safety of the Intended Functionality
(SOTIF) in the automotive context. Cooperative information
can increase the efficiency of motion planning for IVs. Relying on wrong information, however, may lead to emergency
braking or even crashes. In order to reach SOTIF, measures
have to be taken to avoid such incidences. Consider, for
example, an IV approaching an intersection with occlusion
of the crossing road for on-board sensors. In order to resolve
the occlusion, infrastructure sensor modules are posted at the
intersection. From the sensor data, an environment model is
computed. This model then is reported to the IV by a road
side unit (RSU).
While classical probabilistic approaches can easily model
uncertainty in the object states, often described by covariance matrices, they lack the ability to explicitly model
the evidence-based statistical uncertainty of the estimated
probabilities [2]. In the example mentioned above, it can
be intuitively seen that the reliability of the incoming data

depends on the amount of evidence supporting them. While
classical probabilistic approaches can easily model the probability of the hypothesis that a road user is at a given position
at a given time, they lack the ability to express how much
evidence actually supports the hypothesis and what is the
influence of the assumed prior.
In this work, a Subjective-Logic-based (SL-based) online
estimation mechanism is presented, that holistically estimates
the reliability of cooperative information reported by other
agents, such as the RSU in the example mentioned above.
Through the use of SL calculus, IVs are not only able to
calculate the SOTIF-related measures, but also determine
their corresponding certainty in terms of statistics. Testing
for different aspects of functionality results in multiple
information sources within the IV, termed as opinions [2]. By
SL-based fusion of these opinions, we are able to monitor
and incorporate multiple areas of functional errors. In this
work, we propose the use of four opinions, each providing
evidence for the correctness of the overall system. The four
tests are 1) the prediction test, in which the RSU’s past
behavior prediction of individual objects within its field of
view (FOV) is compared to the current situation, 2) the
map test, which checks the reported objects for consistency
with the IV’s digital map, 3) the ego perception test, which
compares detections from the IV’s ego perception with
the reported object list, and 4) the ego localization test,
which compares the estimated ego position with that of the
corresponding reported object along with its uncertainty. The
system overview is sketched in Fig. 1.
In distributed systems theory, integrity monitoring and
reliability estimation is generally termed Fault Detection and
Isolation (FDI) [3]. However, while being a long investigated
topic, most developed mechanisms still suffer from exhaustive resource consumption and are centralized by nature, i.e.

require an overall monitoring entity and are thus unable to
scale up to large installations [3], [4]. Furthermore, isolation
of (identified) faulty nodes is an open issue [4]. The scheme
described within this work shows an online-capable and thus
low resource consuming, decentralized approach, that is able
to detect faulty behavior before the fault takes effect.
In the automotive domain, integrity monitoring for IVs
is used to monitor digital map reliability using a datadriven classifier approach [5] and to estimate and assure lane
information quality [6], including probabilistic fusion from
multiple sources using the Dempster-Shafer (DS) theory of
evidence [7], [8]. While being effective in practice, for their
specific use-case, these approaches are tailored towards use
of data that is generated from on-board sensors within an
IV. We, on the other hand, propose a solution that uses
information from the outside and additionally is simple in
terms of computational complexity. Lastly, our approach
relies on the theory of SL [2], thus does not suffer from the
drawback of inconsistent system behavior in some cases due
to weaknesses in the underlying DS-based fusion [7], [8]. In
comparison to [9], our system takes into account multiple
information sources and yields continuous reliabilities as
well as their estimation uncertainties rather than a binary
classification as part of the fusion process.
Recent works on misbehavior detection in vehicular adhoc networks (VANETS) proposed the use of neural networks [10] or SL [11]. While also being designed for large
scale and distributed systems, both approaches focus on the
security aspects of VANETS. While we acknowledge the
importance of security for intra-vehicle communication, we
focus on the safety of vehicular communication and the
corresponding SOTIF challenges, i.e. assuring functionality
safety of a cooperatively perceived environmental model.
In light of previous research, we propose a novel framework for online reliability estimation of cooperative information received from RSUs using the theory of Subjective
Logic. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we
show how SL can be used as a general framework for IVs to
assess and fuse individual, orthogonal information cues into
one holistic overall reliability estimate and guarantee SOTIF
protection levels. Second, we propose four exemplary tests
in the context of IVs receiving cooperative information from
an RSU. These tests are designed to enable a SOTIF-aware
functionality for IVs and are tested in a real-world experiment, which shows that the proposed framework delivers
reliable and good results.
II. SUBJECTIVE LOGIC BASICS
Subjective Logic is an extension of classical probability
theory that explicitly models statistical uncertainty. It unifies
several evidence-based extensions of classical probability
theory, such as Dempster-Shafer theory, and is linked to classical probability theory by a bijective mapping to Dirichlet
distributions [2]. One of the key features of SL is a set of
fusion operators that make it possible to combine different
pieces of evidence, termed opinions. The Aleatory Cumulative Belief Fusion operator is used to combine independent

pieces of evidence to reduce the statistical uncertainty. In
turn, the Aleatory Belief Fusion operator is used to average
over statistical dependent pieces of evidence. Finally, the
Uncertainty Weighted Average Belief Fusion operator does
a weighted averaging between two opinions, while the result
tends towards the more certain opinion. In this section, we
briefly summarize the SL basics used in this paper. The
definitions and theorems are taken from [2], where further
details can be found.
Definition 1 (Subjective Logic opinion): Let X be a
domain and card{X} ≥ 2, where card{ · } is the cardinality.
Let X further be a random variable in X. A SL opinion
(opinion in short) is an ordered triple ωx = (bx , ux , ax )
with

1=
ax ,
(1a)
x∈X

bx : X 7→ [0, 1],

1 = ux +

X

bx .

(1b)

x∈X

Hereby, bx is the belief mass distribution over X, ux is the
uncertainty mass representing a lack of evidence, and ax is
the base rate distribution over X representing the prior.
Definition 2 (Dirichlet Distribution): Let X be a domain
of W mutually disjoint values, r x ∈ N be the evidence for
outcome x ∈ X, ax a prior distribution over X, and px the
probability distribution of x over X. Then, the probability
density function (PDF)

Dir(px , r x , ax ) = Q

(2)
where r x + ax W ≥ 0 and px > 0 for r x + ax W < 1, is
called Dirichlet PDF. A Dirichlet PDF with W = 2 is called
β-distribution. In (2), Γ( · ) is the Gamma function [12].
Remark: Dirichlet PDFs, in essence, are probability distributions over discrete probability distributions, stating the
probability that according to the available evidence, the
assumed discrete probability distribution is correct. Thus,
Dirichlet PDFs and β-PDFs in particular are used within
this work to visualize SL opinions as well as reliabilities.
The higher the value of a β-PDF at a given probability, the
more evidence supports the probability.

III. RELIABILITY ESTIMATION MECHANISM
In this section, the reliability estimation mechanism is
described in detail. First, the four single tests are described.
Then, the fusion process of all test results is explained.
A. Consistency Check of the Prediction
The basic idea of the consistency check of the RSU’s
behavior prediction is to accumulate predictions as well
as the actual measurements and then compare whether or
not the former predictions fit to the latter measurements.
Therefore, upper and lower bounds of each prediction point
are calculated. Mathematically, this forms a set of tuples
{(xp,l , xp,u )i }, where xp,l is the lower bound of a prediction
point and xp,u is the upper bound, respectively. In the second
step, the set of actual measurements {xm,j } is linearly
interpolated resulting in the polygon line PL({xm,j }). The
polygon line then splits the measurement space M into an
upper and a lower subspace Mu ({xm,j }) and Ml ({xm,j }),
respectively. The set of prediction tuples {(xp,l , xp,u )i } then
is partitioned into a correct and incorrect subset:
Scorrect = {(xp,l , xp,u )i |xp,l ∈ Ml ∧ xp,u ∈ Mu } , (8a)
Sincorrect = {(xp,l , xp,u )i } \ Scorrect .

(8b)

of the test opinion, accounting for the statistical dependence
of the prediction samples, is performed. Herby, pindep can be
interpreted as the probability vector that the current piece of
evidence is statistically independent of the evidence already
accounted for and thus truly brings new information into the
fusion result. Simply spoken, a tuple is classified as correct,
if the polygon line intersects the corresponding interval.
Otherwise, it is classified as incorrect. Note that the trust
discounting step basically has the same effect as applying the
partially dependent source cumulative belief fusion operator
from SL described in [13].
As we focus on reliability analysis rather than object
prediction in this work, for simplicity, a Kalman filter with a
constant velocity model is used to predict the objects’ future
positions along their lanes. This is then used as behavior
prediction of the RSU. Thus, the upper and lower bounds
can simply be chosen as the ±σ bounds of the individual
prediction points. Note that more sophisticated methods for
behavior prediction, e.g. [14], exist and can be integrated as
well. The upper and lower bounds then have to be chosen
accordingly.
B. Consistency Check Between Map and Received Object
Lists
The idea of this test is to detect inconsistency between the
digital map of the IV and the object list ORSU reported by the
RSU. Therefore, the typical positions of the object centers,
according to the RSU perception, are determined during
commissioning, hence guaranteeing the correct functionality
of the RSU. This is done using several 1D histograms
along the lanes spread over the RSU’s FOV, where the 1D
histograms only resolve the lateral position of the object
centers and are simply stacked along the lanes (see Fig.
2). The individual bin length lbin is chosen to compromise
between fine-grained approximation of the corresponding
continuous density and a reasonable value of object probes
that accumulates within each bin. Note that we do not expect
the exact number of bins to have a strong influence on
the overall result because of the Aleatoric Average Belief
Fusion performed over all individual bins. The reference
histograms then are mapped to reference opinions ωxref,i using
the equivalence mapping (7) and pooled according to
M
ωxref,i .
(11)
ωxref =
∀i

Thus, only one average opinion ωxref per lane is computed.
These ωxref are stored in the digital map of the vehicle.
When the IV approaches the FOV of the RSU, it starts
to create a set of histograms using the same bins as for the
creation of the reference opinion. The sample opinion
M
ωxs,i
(12)
ωxs =
∀i

is then determined online, the same way as ωxref but with
only the online data available from the reported object lists
ORSU,k . If the RSU data is consistent with the map, the
distance between the opinions ωxs and ωxref should be small,
i.e. below a threshold θDC . A measure for the distance
between opinions is the degree of conflict [2]

probability that a single measurement is meaningful. Here,

C. Comparison Between Ego Perception and Received Object Lists
The RSU’s main purpose is to extend the environmental
model of the IV into areas that are occluded for the IV’s ego
perception. Therefore, it can be expected that the mutual
FOV of the IV and the RSU is small and mostly in corner
regions, where the IV’s ego perception reliability is reduced.
Furthermore, objects may move quickly through the narrow
mutual FOV. Thus, it can be expected that the IV’s ego
perception will only receive very view measurements to
confirm the existence of an object reported by the RSU. As
a first step, we perform nearest neighbor association with
the Euclidean distance between object oRSU
received from
i

detected with the IV’s onthe RSU and the objects oego
i
board perception FOV. For gating, a simple thresholding
with a fixed threshold dmax is used before association. Note
that more sophisticated mechanisms for both gating and data
association are available [15] and could be integrated as well.
We, however, want to focus on the overall idea of SL-based
fusion and reliability estimation in this work and thus use this
simple, yet effective technique for gating and association. If a
matching object is found, the trust into the RSU is increased,
else a missing detection is assumed and the trust into the
RSU is strongly reduced. Mathematically, this mechanism
can be described as

ω input (k) =

(16c)
ω perc (k + 1) = ω perc (k) ⊕ ω input (k) .

(16d)

In (16), ω conf describes the opinion resulting from an object
within the ego perception that confirms an object oi from the
RSU’s object list ORSU , while ω mis is the opinion resulting
from a missing detection, i.e. when the ego perception detects
an object that has no match in ORSU . To account for the
fact that missing detection might have severe implications,
they are up-weighted and compared to positive tests with the
parameter wmis , which ensures that missing objects decrease
confidence in the RSU significantly.
The new input opinion ω input then is fused with the
last perception test opinion ω perc (k) resulting in the new
perception test opinion ω perc (k + 1). This time-recursive
structure incorporates the fact that both the ego and the RSU
perception are expected to have recursive estimators to create
their individual object lists.
D. Comparison Between Ego Localization and Received
Object Lists
Even though the comparison between ego perception and
received object list can detect the occurrence of missed
detections in the RSU, it does not make a statement on
the measurement uncertainties reported by the RSU. This
is due to the fact that the measured objects are extended
by nature. Thus, the IV may perceive only a part of an
object, while the RSU perceives the whole object resulting in
differing object center estimates. A check on the uncertainties
thus would not always be meaningful for the ego perception
test. Hence, an additional test is needed. By comparing the
object oRSU,ego ∈ ORSU corresponding to the IV with the
ego localization, a very precise measurement is available to
evaluate the uncertainties reported by the RSU. Furthermore,
the ego localization test is always possible, even if no other
road user is approaching the intersection.
The reported uncertainties are checked by comparing
the Euclidean distance between ego localization and object

ω loc (k + 1) = ω loc (k) ⊕ ω input (k) ,

E. Fusion of the Test Results
So far, four tests have been proposed, each of which
focuses on a different property of valid RSU data. While
the map test and the prediction test completely rely on the
data reported by the RSU, the ego perception test and the ego
localization test include the IV’s perception as an additional
source of information. Thus, given the same amount of
evidence, the tests including the IV’s perception are far
more important for the overall estimation of the RSU’s
reliability. In turn, as the ego perception test as well as
the ego localization test need the IV to be already very
close to the intersection, these tests will usually operate on
a far smaller amount of evidence than the tests independent
of the IV’s perception. Both effects are accounted for by
combining the uncertainty weighted average belief fusion
operator with a simple importance weighted average belief
fusion. Mathematically, this can be expressed as

the total uncertainty consisting of the ego localization uncertainty and the reported uncertainty σtotal = σoego + σego . If
dE (xego , xoego ) < 3·σtotal , the opinions are considered consistent and the trust into the RSU is increased. Otherwise, under
the assumption that the error is Gaussian, the probability of
the data being consistent is less than 1%. Thus, in this case,
the trust into the RSU is reduced. If no matching object oego
can be found within dmax , a missing detection in the RSU’s
perception is detected and the incidence is passed to the ego
perception test. Mathematically, the ego localization test can

IV. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
The experiment is set up at a mid-size city crossing, with
occlusion due to close-to-road buildings. Besides others, four
SICK LD-MRS 8 layer laserscanners are mounted on poles
in 7 m height, observing the intersection. Their data is fused
and the resulting object list is then reported to the IV by
the RSU. Fig. 2 sketches the FOV covered by the LiDAR
subsystem of the RSU. As can be seen, the laserscanners
show a blind spot where sensor reliability is reduced1 . Thus,
real examples of missing detections are expected to be found
within the recorded data. The IV approaches this intersection,
while the RSU sends object lists of its perception.
For the IV, an automated vehicle as described in [16]
is used. For the ego perception, the front IBEO 4 layer
laserscanner is used. The IV is localized using a high
precision real time kinematic (RTK) system.
V. EVALUATION
For evaluation, 14 sequences where recorded on two
different days, where the IV approaches the intersection on
different entrance lanes. The sequences have been manually
labeled with respect to malfunctions of the RSU such as
missing detections. In 7 sequences the RSU has been manually classified as correctly behaving, while in the other 7, the
RSU shows misbehavior. The map test could not, however,
be evaluated without modifying the recorded data. In order
to evaluate the map test, thus, the original data reported by
the RSU are shifted in east direction. This corresponds to a
differently chosen reference point or a calibration error due
to a GPS offset during recalibration.
A. Consistency Check Evaluation of the Prediction

seen in Fig. 5(c). As consequence, the estimated reliability is
significantly decreased, as can be seen in Fig. 5(b). The βPDF corresponding to the respective perception test opinion
at that instance of time is depicted in red in Fig. 5(a).
After the missing detections, the estimated reliability slowly
recovers due to the following correctly reported information.

Prediction test: The left picture shows the partitioning of the
measurement space as well as the classification into correctly predicted
tuples and incorrect predicted tuples. In the right picture, the resulting βPDF is depicted. As a lot of tuples are incorrectly predicted, the β-PDF
is shifted to about 60% correct function probability indicating a reduced
reliability.

To evaluate the consistency test between the map and the
received object lists, the objects from the RSU are shifted by
a constant offset to simulate an RSU calibration or mapping
error. As the object centers are highly concentrated within
a small band in the northern branch of the intersection (see
Fig. 2), the probability gradient along east direction is big.
Figure 4 shows the effect of a shift in east direction on
the estimated reliability. It can be seen that the test reacts
quite sensitively to a shift in east direction due to the big
probability gradient. If the shift is big enough, the RSU
reports objects at positions that are physically unfeasible, i.e.
objects moving over houses. Thus, the estimated reliability
then is reduced to zero all of a sudden (see ∆East = 2.25 m).

(b) Effect of missing detection to reliability estimated by the perception test.
The opinion is projected to the estimated reliability using pω = bω + uω aω .
At 6.8 s the IV’s perception detects a bicycle that is not reported by the RSU.
Thus the reliability estimated by the perception test is significantly decreased.

Hence, some of the prediction tuples {(xp,l , xp,u )i } are
classified as incorrect. This leads to a reduction of the
estimated reliability. Thus, it can be seen that the proposed
mechanism behaves as expected.

As can be seen, depending on the map-shift amount, the reliability estimate
drops from higher to lower values, consistent with the expectations in the
experimental setup.

C. Evaluation of the Comparison between Ego Perception
and Received Object Lists
Figure 5 exemplary shows the effect of a missing detection
in the RSU. First of all, the ego perception objects match
the objects reported by the RSU. Hence, the estimated
reliability of the RSU is high as can be seen from the

Fig. 5.

Ego perception test.

D. Evaluation of the Comparison between Ego Localization
and Received Object Lists
In Fig. 6, the effect of an underestimated uncertainty
is demonstrated by example, where the overall uncertainty
σtotal was chosen too small. Thus, the estimated reliability is
reduced from the prior estimation, because the geometrical
center of the ego vehicle according to the RTK measurement
is outside the 3σ uncertainty ellipse estimated by the RSU.

Fig. 6. Localization test opinion mapped to estimated reliability using
pω = bω + uω aω . At 27.2 s the IV gets into the FOV of the intersection,
but the position of the IV according to ego localization cannot be explained
by the position and its too small uncertainty estimated by the RSU. Thus
the reliability of the RSU estimated by the localization test is significantly
decreased.

E. Evaluation of the Overall Reliability Estimation
In order to evaluate the overall reliability estimation, the
reliability estimations are mapped to β-distributions and
visualized all in Fig. 7. The β-distributions resulting from
the sequences with correctly performing RSU are marked
in blue, while the β-distributions resulting from a faulty
RSU are marked in red. It can be seen that the two classes
are easily separable using the proposed reliability estimation
mechanism. Furthermore it shows that the reliability is estimated to be beyond 85% whenever the RSU is reliable, while
the estimated reliability is below 75% whenever the RSU
is faulty. By integrating over the β-distributions it can be
confirmed that for all true positives, a 90% confidence level
supports the hypothesis that the correct function probability
is at least 90%. In turn, whenever the RSU is faulty, there is at
least a 90% confidence that the correct function probability is
at most 70%. This demonstrates that the reliability estimation
mechanism works well and shows robustness with respect to
intra-class variations.

VI. CONCLUSIONS
In this work, a general framework to estimate the reliability of cooperative information received from an Road
Side Unit (RSU) for use in intelligent vehicles (IVs) was
presented. By the use of the theory of Subjective Logic (SL),
we showed how orthogonal information sources (termed

opinions in SL) can be fused in a natural and mathematically
sound and easily extendable way. To prove the applicability,
four exemplary tests were proposed, which individually only
provide mild cues towards an RSU’s reliability of information. However, after the proposed scheme for probabilistic
fusion, IVs are able to separate faulty from correct data samples with a large margin of safety. Real-world experiments
showed the applicability and effectiveness of our approach.
In future, the possible faulty effects of wireless data
communication as well as the effects of sudden and shortlived sources of error, like sensor blockage, will be examined.
