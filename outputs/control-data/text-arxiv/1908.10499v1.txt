This paper revisits the parametric analysis of semidefinite optimization problems with respect to the perturbation of the objective function along a fixed direction. We review the notions of invariancy set, nonlinearity
interval, and transition point of the optimal partition, and we investigate their characterizations. We show
that the continuity of the optimal set mapping, on the basis of Painlevé-Kuratowski set convergence, might
fail on a nonlinearity interval. Furthermore, under a mild assumption, we prove that the set of transition
points and the set of points at which the optimal set mapping is discontinuous are finite. We then present
a methodology, stemming from numerical algebraic geometry, to efficiently compute nonlinearity intervals
and transition points of the optimal partition. Finally, we support the theoretical results by applying our
procedure to some numerical examples.

where C, Ai ∈ Sn for i = 1, . . . , m, b ∈ Rm , C̄ ∈ Sn is a fixed direction, the inner product is defined as
hC, X i := tr(CX), and X  0 means that the matrix X is symmetric and positive semidefinite. Let
v() ∈ R ∪ {−∞, ∞} denote the optimal value of (P ). This yields a function v : R → R ∪ {−∞, ∞}
which is the so-called optimal value function. Let E := { ∈ R : v() > −∞} be the domain of v().
The primal and dual optimal set mappings are defined as
P ∗ ():= {X : hC + C̄, X i = v(), X ∈ P ()},
D∗ ():= (y, S) : bT y = v(), (y, S) ∈ D() ,

where P () and D() denote the primal and dual feasible set mappings:

Note that P ∗ () or D∗ () might be empty for some  ∈ E . To avoid trivialities, we make the following
assumption throughout this paper:
Assumption 1. The interior point
 condition holds for both (P ) and (D ) at  = 0, i.e., there
exists a feasible X ◦ (0), y ◦ (0), S ◦ (0) ∈ P ∗ (0) × D∗ (0) such that X ◦ (0), S ◦ (0)  0, where  0 means
positive definite.
Assumption 1 implies that E is nonempty and non-singleton, and that v() is proper and concave
on E [8, Lemma 2.2]. The concavity of v() yields that E is a closed, possibly unbounded, interval [8,
Lemma 2.2] and that v() is continuous on int(E ) [11, Corollary 2.109].
Remark 1. Assumption
1 is equivalent to the existence of a strictly feasible solution

X ◦ (), y ◦ (), S ◦ () at every  ∈ int(E ) [19, Lemma 3.1], where int(.) denotes the interior of a
convex set.
Hence, for all  ∈ int(E ), Assumption 1 ensures that strong duality holds and that the optimal sets
P ∗ () and D∗ () are nonempty and compact. In this paper, by strong duality we mean that the
optimal values of (P ) and (D ) are both attained and the duality gap is zero, see e.g., [11, Theorem
5.81]. In particular, the optimality conditions for (P ) and (D ) can be written as

XS = 0,
X, S  0,
where XS = 0 denotes the complementarity condition. Furthermore, Assumption 1 guarantees the
existence of a so-called maximally complementary optimal solution for every  ∈ int(E ).

solution X (), y (), S () is called strictly complementary if X ∗ () + S ∗ ()  0.


For any fixed  ∈ int(E ), rank X ∗ () + rank S ∗ () is maximal on P ∗ () × D∗ (), see e.g., [15,
Lemma 2.3]. Even though a strictly complementary optimal solution may fail to exist, a maximally
complementary optimal solution always exists under Assumption 1.
In practice, given a fixed , (P ) and (D ) can be efficiently solved in polynomial time using a
primal-dual path-following interior point method (IPM), see [32]. A primal-dual path following
IPM generates a sequence of solutions whose accumulation points are maximally complementary
optimal solutions [21].
1.1. Optimal partition For SDO, the optimal partition information can be leveraged to
establish sensitivity analysis results. The optimal partition provides a characterization of the optimal set, and it is uniquely defined for any instance of an SDO problem which satisfies strong

duality [15]. For a fixed  ∈ int(E ), let X ∗ (), y ∗ (), S ∗() ∈ ri P ∗ () × D∗ () be a maximally com
plementary optimal solution, and let B ():= R X ∗ () , N ():= R S ∗ () , and T ():= R X ∗ () +


R S ∗ ()
, where R(.) is the column space and ⊥ denotes the orthogonal complement of a subspace. Then the triple B
 (), T (), N () is called the optimal partition of (P ) and (D ). Note that
the subspaces R X ∗ () and R S ∗ () are orthogonal
by the complementarity condition in (1).

Further, the optimal partition B (), T (), N () is independent of the choice of a maximally complementary optimal solution [15, Lemma 2.3(i)].
1.2. Related works Sensitivity analysis along a fixed direction has been extensively studied
in optimization theory and was originally introduced for linear optimization (LO) and linearly
constrained quadratic optimization (LCQO) problems in [1, 8, 27]. Sensitivity analysis of nonlinear optimization problems was studied by Fiacco [17] and Fiacco and McCormick [16] using the
implicit function theorem [36]. Their analysis was based on linear independence constraint qualification, second-order sufficient condition, and the strict complementarity condition. Furthermore,
Fiacco [17] showed how to compute/approximate the partial derivatives of a locally optimal solution. Robinson [35] removed the reliance on the strict complementarity condition by imposing a
strong second-order sufficient condition. Kojima [29] removed the dependence on the strict complementarity condition by invoking the degree theory of a continuous map, see e.g., [33]. See [18]
for a survey of classical results.
A comprehensive treatment of directional and differential stability of nonlinear SDO problems is
given by Bonnans and Shapiro [10, 11], see also [9, 38]. The study of sensitivity analysis based on
the optimal partition approach was initiated by Adler and Monteiro [1] and Jansen et al. [27] for LO
and then extended for LCQO, SDO, and linear conic optimization by Berkelaar et al. [8], Goldfarb
and Scheinberg [19], and Yildirim [43], respectively. Recently, the second and fourth authors [30]
introduced the concepts of a nonlinearity interval and a transition point for the optimal partition
of (P ) and (D ) to investigate the sensitivity of the optimal partition and the approximation of
the optimal partition with respect to .
1.3. Contributions A parametric SDO problem was initially studied in [19, 30]. Based on
the notion of an invariancy set, which might be either a singleton or an open interval, from [19, 30]
and the notions of nonlinearity interval and transition point from [30], we present a methodology
for the identification of the optimal partitions on the entire int(E ). An invariancy interval is an open
subinterval of int(E ) on which the optimal partition is invariant with respect to . A nonlinearity
interval is an open maximal length subinterval of int(E ) on which the rank of maximally complementary optimal solutions X ∗ () and S ∗ () stay constant, while the optimal partition varies with
. A transition point is a singleton invariancy set which does not belong to a nonlinearity interval.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive methodology for the computation of
nonlinearity intervals and transition points in int(E ).
Our main contributions are 1) the study of continuity of optimal set mapping on a nonlinearity
interval, 2) algebraic interpretation of transition points of the optimal partition, and 3) a numerical
procedure for the computation of nonlinearity intervals and transition points. Using continuity
arguments on the basis of Painlevé-Kuratowski set convergence, we provide sufficient conditions
under which the set of transition points has empty interior, see Lemma 2, and a nonlinearity
interval exists, see Lemma 3. We analyze the continuity of the optimal set mapping and show that
continuity may fail on a nonlinearity interval, see problem (8). Furthermore, we show that even a
continuous selection [37, Chapter 5(J)] through the relative interior of the optimal sets might fail to
exist, see problem (10). The second part of this paper investigates the computation of nonlinearity
intervals and transition points of the optimal partition. Under a mild assumption, we show that
the set of transition points and the set of points at which the optimal set mapping fails to be

continuous relative to int(E ) are finite, see Theorem 2. Using numerical algebraic geometry, we then
present a methodology to partition int(E ) into the finite union of invariancy intervals, nonlinearity
intervals, and transition points, see Algorithms 1 through 4.
Besides sensitivity analysis purposes and their economical interpretations, the identification of a
nonlinearity interval is important from practical perspectives. For example, in order to approximate
the optimal value function on a neighborhood of a given , one needs to utilize samples from the
same nonlinearity interval containing . Cifuentes et al. [13] studied the local stability of SDO
relaxations for polynomial and semi-algebraic optimization problems with emphasis on a notion
similar to a nonlinearity interval.
1.4. Organization of the paper The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2,
we investigate the continuity of the feasible and optimal set mappings at a given  ∈ int(E ) relative
to int(E ). In Section 3, we study the sensitivity of the optimal partition with respect to . Further,
we use continuity arguments to partially characterize nonlinearity intervals and transition points,
and we investigate the continuity of the optimal set mapping on a nonlinearity interval. In Section 4,
we present an algorithm to partition int(E ) into invariancy intervals, nonlinearity intervals, and
transition points of the optimal partition. Our numerical experiments are presented in Section 5.
Finally, we present remarks and topics for future research in Section 6.

see e.g., [15] for more details. Finally, for a given  ∈ int(E ), a maximally complementary optimal
solution is denoted by X ∗ (), y ∗ (), S ∗ () .
2. Continuity of the feasible set and optimal set mappings This section investigates
the continuity of the primal and dual feasible set mappings and the outer semicontinuity of the
primal and dual optimal set mappings for (P ) and (D ). We adopt the notions and definitions
from [37].
Let Rq and Rl be finite-dimensional Euclidean spaces. A mapping Φ(ξ) : Rq ⇒ Rl is called a setvalued mapping if it assigns a subset of Rl to each element of Rq . The domain of a set-valued
mapping Φ(ξ) is
dom(Φ):= {ξ : Φ(ξ) 6= ∅},
and the range of Φ(ξ) is defined as
range(Φ):= {ν : ∃ ξ s.t. ν ∈ Φ(ξ)}.
The following discussion concisely reviews the continuity of a set-valued mapping on the basis of
Painlevé-Kuratowski set convergence, see [37, Chapters 4 and 5] for more details. Let N be the set

When X = Rq , we simply call Φ(ξ) outer or inner semicontinuous at ξ.
Definition 2. A set-valued mapping Φ(ξ) is Painlevé-Kuratowski continuous at ξ¯ relative to
X if it is both outer and inner semicontinuous at ξ¯ relative to X .
In our setting, outer and inner semicontinuity agree with the notions of closedness and openness
of a point-to-set map in [26], see also [37, Theorem 5.7(c)] and [26, Corollary 1.1].
We show the continuity of the feasible set mapping and the outer semicontinuity of the optimal set
mapping relative to int(E ). Trivially, P () : R ⇒ Sn is continuous since it remains invariant with
respect to . Furthermore, the continuity of D() : R ⇒ Rm × Sn relative to int(E ) follows from [26,
Theorems 10 and 12], where D() = ∅ for every  ∈ R \ E . For the sake of completeness, we provide
a proof for our special case here. Let Dy () : R ⇒ Rm be a set-valued mapping defined by

Now, the following result is in order.
Lemma 1. Under Assumption 1, the set-valued mapping Dy () and thus D() are continuous
relative to int(E ).
Proof Since Sn+ is a closed convex cone and int(E ) ⊆ dom(Dy ), it follows that Dy () is outer
semicontinuous relative to int(E ), see e.g., [37, Example 5.8]. Hence, it only remains to show that
Dy () is inner semicontinuous at every 0 ∈ int(E ).

the proof for the continuity
of Dy () relative to int(E ). The continuity of D() is then immediate
Pm
from S = C + C̄ − i=1 yi Ai . 
As a result of Lemma 1, we can show that P ∗ () : R ⇒ Sn and D∗ () : R ⇒ Rm × Sn are outer
semicontinuous relative to int(E ), see e.g., [26, Theorem 8]. All this implies that for any 0 ∈ int(E )
and any sequence k → 0 we have
lim inf P ∗ (k ) ⊆ lim sup P ∗ (k ) ⊆ P ∗ (0 )
k→∞

k→∞

and

lim inf D∗ (k ) ⊆ lim sup D∗ (k ) ⊆ D∗ (0 ).
k→∞

k→∞

However, P ∗ () and D∗ () are not necessarily inner semicontinuous relative to int(E ) as shown in
Example 1, where the optimal set is multiple-valued at  = 12 but single-valued everywhere else in
a neighborhood of 12 . Nevertheless, the set of points at which P ∗ () or D∗ () fails to be continuous
relative to int(E ) is of first category in int(E ), i.e., it is the union of countably many nowhere dense
sets in int(E ), see e.g., [31]. This directly follows from the outer semicontinuity of the optimal set
mapping relative to int(E ) and Theorem 5.55 in [37]. All this yields the following result.
Theorem 1. The set of points at which P ∗ () or D∗ () fails to be continuous relative to int(E )
has empty interior.
Proof Since int(E ) is a Baire subset of R [31, Lemma 48.4], every first category subset of int(E )
has empty interior. 
As a consequence of Theorem 1, every open subset of int(E ) contains a point at which both P ∗ ()
and D∗ () are continuous relative to int(E ).
3. Sensitivity of the optimal partition We briefly review the notions of an invariancy

interval, nonlinearity interval, and a transition point from [30]. Let π():= B (), T (), N () denote
the subspaces of the optimal partition at , and let
Q := QB() , QT () , QN ()



be an orthonormal basis partitioned according to the subspaces of the optimal partition.
Definition 3 ([19, 30]). An invariancy set is a subset Iinv of int(E ) on which π() is invariant
for all  ∈ Iinv . A non-singleton Iinv is called an invariancy interval. Otherwise, Iinv is called a
singleton invariancy set.

Indeed, a non-singleton invariancy set is proven to be an open, possibly unbounded, subinterval
of int(E ) [30, Section 3.1]. The boundary points of an invariancy set, containing a given ¯, can be
efficiently computed by solving a pair of auxiliary SDO problems [19, Lemma 4.1]:

where we might have αinv = −∞, βinv = ∞, or both. If αinv < ¯ < βinv holds, then ¯ belongs to an
invariancy interval. Otherwise, ¯ is a singleton invariancy set which either belongs to a nonlinearity
interval, or it is a transition point, as formally defined in Definitions 4 and 5.
Definition 4 (Definition 3.6 in [30]). Anonlinearity interval
is an open maximal subin
terval Inon of int(E ) on which both rank X ∗ () and rank S ∗ () are constant while π() varies
with .
Definition 5 (Definition 3.5 in [30]). A singleton invariancy set {¯} ⊂ int(E ) is called a
transition point if for every δ > 0, there exists  ∈ (¯
 − δ, ¯ + δ) such that




rank X ∗ () 6= rank X ∗ (¯
) or rank S ∗ () 6= rank S ∗ (¯
) .
(5)
Remark 2. Both the primal and dual optimal sets must vary with  on a nonlinearity interval.
Otherwise, one would get an invariancy interval [30, Lemma 3.3 and Remark 5]. Indeed, a nonlinearity interval can
 be thought of as the union of infinitely many singleton invariancy sets on which
both rank X ∗ () and rank S ∗ () stay constant.
Since the domain E may be unbounded, a nonlinearity interval Inon may be unbounded too. Furthermore, a boundary point of an invariancy or a nonlinearity interval must be a transition point,
since (5) always holds at a boundary point, see also [30, Remark 5]. Lemma 2 indicates that under
an extra condition, the converse of this statement is true as well, i.e., a transition point must be a
boundary point of an invariancy or a nonlinearity interval.
Lemma 2. Assume that the set of points at which P ∗ () or D∗ () fails to be continuous relative
to int(E ) is finite. Then the set of transition points in int(E ) has empty interior.
Proof To reach a contradiction, suppose that there exists a subset I ⊆ int(E ) with int(I ) 6= ∅
such that  is a transition point for every  ∈ I . By the assumption, there must exist ¯ ∈ int(I ) and
ς > 0 such that both P ∗ () and D∗ () are continuous on (¯
 − ς, ¯ + ς), and




rank X ∗ (¯
) ≤ rank X ∗ () and rank S ∗ (¯
) ≤ rank S ∗ ()
hold with at least one strict inequality for every  ∈ (¯
 − ς, ¯ + ς). Then choosing ¯:=  and applying
this argument infinitely many times with a small enough ς >
 0 and an ∗ ∈ (¯
 − ς, ¯ + ς), we arrive
∗
at a contradiction, since each iteration increases rank X () or rank S () at least by 1. 
Under the condition of Lemma 2, the union of invariancy and nonlinearity intervals is dense in
int(E ). The following example shows the existence of nonlinearity intervals and transition points.

Due to unknown behavior of the optimal set mapping in a parametric SDO problem, see Remark 2,
a general existence condition for a nonlinearity interval or a transition point is still an open question.
Nevertheless, strict complementarity coupled with the continuity of the optimal set mapping at a
given ¯ relative to int(E ) provide sufficient conditions for the existence of a nonlinearity interval
surrounding ¯, see also [30, Theorems 3.7 and 3.10].

Lemma 3. Assume that {¯} is a singleton invariancy set. If (X ∗ (¯
), y ∗ (¯
), S ∗ (¯
) is a strictly
complementary optimal solution, and both the primal and dual optimal set mappings are continuous
at ¯ relative to int(E ), then ¯ belongs to a nonlinearity interval.
Proof The strict complementarity condition yields


rank X ∗ (¯
) + rank S ∗ (¯
) = n.
Continuity of X ∗ () and S ∗ () at ¯, along with the continuity
of the eigenvalues, shows that

rank X (¯
) ≤ rank X () and rank S (¯
) ≤ rank S () for all  in a small neighborhood of ¯,
see also [36, Theorem 3B.2(b)]. Hence, the rank of X ∗ () and S ∗ () remain constant on a sufficiently
small neighborhood of ¯. 
Unfortunately, the converse of Lemma 3 is not necessarily true for a parametric SDO problem. In
fact, the primal or dual optimal set mapping might fail to be continuous on a nonlinearity interval.
This can occur since the lim inf of a sequence of faces is not necessarily a face of the feasible set,
i.e., it might be a subset of the relative interior of a face. A counterexample can be given as


(

where the strict complementarity condition holds on a nonlinearity interval (− 12 , 32 ), see [30, Example 3.1]. The primal optimal set mapping is single-valued, and thus continuous, everywhere on
(− 12 , 12 ) ∪ ( 12 , 32 ). However, P ∗ () fails to be inner semicontinuous at  = 21 , because
lim inf P ∗ (k ) ⊂ ri(P ∗ ( 12 ))
k→∞

for any sequence k → 12 .
Remark 3. The continuity condition in Lemma 3 can be relaxed by imposing the conditions

the eigenvalues imply the existence of a nonlinearity interval around ¯. However, even the weaker

for which X ∗ (), y ∗ (), S ∗ () defined by (7) is still a unique strictly complementary optimal solution for all  ∈ (− 12 , 32 ) \ { 12 }, see Figure 2. However, for any k → 21 the sequence X ∗ (k ) converges
to an optimal solution on the boundary of P ∗ ( 12 ). This example shows that even a continuous
selection [37, Chapter 5(J)] through the relative interior of the optimal sets might fail to exist on
a nonlinearity interval. However, we do not know yet whether (9) could fail at a boundary point
of a nonlinearity interval.
4. Identification of the optimal partitions This section proposes a methodology to identify the optimal partitions on the entire int(E ). By Definitions 3 to 5, the interval int(E ) is the union
of invariancy intervals, nonlinearity intervals, and transition points. An invariancy interval can be
efficiently computed by solving the auxiliary problems (4). In general, however, the identification
of a nonlinearity interval around a given ¯ is a nontrivial computational task, since the conditions
of Lemma 3 may not be easily checked in practice. One could try to simply solve (P ) and (D ) for
various  in a neighborhood of ¯ with the aim of finding the desired nonlinearity interval. However,
this could fail due to the fact that the solution of IPMs usually come with numerical inaccuracy,
while an eigenvalue of X ∗ () or S ∗ () might be doubly exponentially small [34]. On the other hand,
since the set of transition points might have empty interior, see Lemma 2, the numerical inaccuracy
could lead one to miss a transition point when simply solving (P ) and (D ) at a given set of mesh
points.
In order to compute the nonlinearity intervals, we numerically locate the transition points by
reformulating the optimality conditions (1) as a system of polynomials. We then view the problem
of finding transition points through the lens of numerical algebraic geometry, see [7, 39] for an
overview of results regarding polynomial systems. Together with the auxiliary problems (4), this
approach allows us to identify the optimal partitions on int(E ).

is denoted by
 
V F (V, ) := V ∈ Cm+2n : F (V, ) = 0 .
(13)

Following this notation, a solution in V F (V, ) , an optimal solution, and a maximally complementary optimal solution of (P ) and (D ) are denoted by V (), V (), and V ∗ (), respectively.
Clearly, V () is not necessarily an optimal solution of (P ) and (D ). As  varies on a nonlinearity
interval Inon , the solutions V ∗ () for  ∈ Inon form a solution sheet of (11).
The Jacobian matrix of (11) is given by

where the symmetric Kronecker product ⊗s is defined in Section 1.4. If the Jacobian is nonsingular
at (V ∗ (¯
), ¯), then V ∗ (¯
) is the unique and strictly complementary optimal solution of (P¯) and (D¯).

Lemma 4 (Theorem 3.1 of [2] and [20]). The Jacobian J V ∗ (¯
), ¯ is nonsingular if and
only if the optimal solution V ∗ (¯
) is unique and strictly complementary.
When the Jacobian is nonsingular, then the implicit function theorem [36] and Lemma 3 describe
the behavior of V ∗ () in a neighborhood of ¯ and induce the existence of a nonlinearity interval
around ¯, see [30, Lemma 3.9] and the subsequent discussion therein. Consequently, transition
points and the points at which P ∗ () or D∗ () fails to be continuous relative to int(E ) are both
subsets of singular points, i.e., the set of  ∈ C such that


∃ V () ∈ V F (V, ) where J V (),  is singular,
in which case V () is called a singular solution. This inclusion might be strict as demonstrated by
problem (8), where  = 12 is a singular point but not a transition point. If  is not a singular point,
then it is called a nonsingular point. Here, our goal is to locate the real singular points in int(E )
and then identify the transition points out of the singular points.
Singular points of parameterized systems are well-studied in algebraic geometry, e.g., Sylvester’s
19th century work in discriminants and resultants [40, 41]. Under a mild assumption, the algebraic
formulation (11) shows that the set of singular points must be an algebraic subset of C, leading to
the following finiteness result.
Theorem 2. Assume that there exists a nonsingular point ¯ ∈ int(E ). Then the set of singular
points in int(E ), and hence the set of transition points and the set of points at which P ∗ () or D∗ ()
fails to be continuous relative to int(E ), are finite.

Proof By definition, the set Υ of all (V (), ) with a singular Jacobian satisfies


Υ:= (V, ) ∈ Cm+2n+1 : F (V, ) = 0, det J(V, ) = 0 ,

(14)

where (14) is a basic constructible set [3] in Cm+2n+1 . Since the projection of a constructible set to
C is a constructible subset of C [3, Theorem 1.22], it holds that

 ∈ C : ∃V ∈ Cm+2n s.t. (V, ) ∈ Υ
(15)
is either finite or the complement of a finite subset of C, see e.g., [3, Exercise 1.2]. On the other
hand, it follows from the assumption and the implicit function theorem that the complement of (15)
contains an open neighborhood of ¯. All this implies that the projection of Υ is finite, and thus it is
an algebraic subset of C. The finiteness result naturally holds when we restrict the set of singular
points to R, in which our domain E is defined. Consequently, there are only finitely many real
singular points in int(E ). 
Remark 4. Under the weaker assumption that there exists a singular point  ∈ int(E ) such
that J V ∗ (), ) is nonsingular, Theorem 2 implies the existence of finitely many singular solutions
in the solution sheet which passes through V ∗ ().
From a computational algebraic geometry viewpoint, the problem of computing singular points for
a parametric SDO problem was studied by the first and third authors in [24] in a more general
context. Here, we present a simplified process to locate the singular points in int(E ). To that end,
we make the following assumption from this point on:
Assumption 2. There exists a nonsingular point ¯ ∈ int(E ).
Remark 5. While the condition of Lemma 2 automatically follows from Assumption 2, Theorem 2 provides a stronger result of finiteness.
With Assumption 2, it follows from Theorem 2 that any two invariancy/nonlinearity intervals are
separated by a transition point. This will enable us to decompose int(E ) into the union of finitely
many open intervals of maximal length and their finitely many singular boundary points. The final
step is to classify the singular points into transition and non-transition points and then form the
nonlinearity intervals from the appropriate open intervals.
Given a nonsingular initial point ¯ ∈ int(E ), the key idea is using Davidenko’s [14, 28] ordinary
differential equation (ODE)
J(V, )

∂F (V, )

(16)

to track an optimal solution V () from ¯ to the nearest singular point in each direction. Since
solutions of (16) correspond to level sets of F (V, ), i.e., {(V, ) : F (V, ) = c} for arbitrary constant
c, using the initial condition V (¯
) = V ∗ (¯
) yields the set of solutions to (11) and (12) for all  in a
neighborhood of ¯. Hence, this approach utilizes the local information provided by the Jacobian,
when it is nonsingular, to obtain accurate approximations of the optimal solutions nearby. The
following lemma provides a summary of the solution [24].
Lemma 5 (Theorems 2 and 3 in [24]). Suppose that the Jacobian is nonsingular on an
interval Ireg ⊆ int(E ) and let ¯ ∈ Ireg . Then, V ∗ () is analytic on Ireg , and it is the unique solution of
dV
∂F (V, )

for every  ∈ Ireg .

)

13

Using the results of [22], we can track along Ireg , on which the optimal solution V ∗ () is analytic,
until we reach the boundary points of Ireg . As the perturbation parameter approaches a singular
point at the boundary of Ireg , ill-conditioning of F (V, ) = 0, or spurious numerical behavior will be
detected numerically. Thus, the singularity of the Jacobian matrix J(V, ) indicates the existence of
a possible transition point. Consequently, the common scenario of jumping over a transition point,
when using just an IPM on discrete mesh points, can be avoided.
At a singular boundary point ˆ, we examine the uniqueness of the corresponding optimal solution
V a (ˆ
), where V a (ˆ
) is an accumulation point of the sequence of unique optimal solutions V ∗ (),
obtained from (16), as  % ˆ or  & ˆ. An accumulation point exists, by the outer semicontinuity of
P ∗ () and D∗ () relative to int(E ), and it belongs to P ∗ (ˆ
) × D∗ (ˆ
). Toward this end, we compute
a
the local dimension of the algebraic set V F (V, ˆ) at V (ˆ

a
of V F (V, ˆ) which contain V (ˆ
). If V F (V, ˆ) has local dimension zero at V a (ˆ
), then we can
conclude from Lemma 3 that ˆ is a transition point, since V a (ˆ
) turns out to be the unique optimal
solution of (Pˆ) and (Dˆ). Otherwise, we need to examine the change of rank at a maximally
∗
complementary
). Such a solution is generic on the irreducible component
 optimal solutiona V (ˆ
of V F (V, ˆ) which contains V (ˆ
), and it can be computed efficiently using numerical algebraic
geometry [7]. See e.g., [39] for a detailed description of algebraic sets and irreducible components.
4.2. Partitioning algorithm Based on the above description, we present the outline of Algorithm 1, a three-part algorithm, i.e., Algorithms 2, 3 and 4, which partitions int(E ) into the finite
union of invariancy intervals, nonlinearity intervals, and transition points. Algorithm 2 computes
the singular boundary points of an invariancy interval, which are indeed the transition points in
int(E ), by solving the auxiliary problems (4). Algorithm 3 locates the singular points in int(E ).
In particular, Algorithm 3 tracks the optimal solution of (P ) and (D ) by solving the ODE system (16) using a predictor-corrector tracking method [12]. This procedure is repeated alongside
Algorithm 2 until all singular points and invariancy intervals in int(E ) are identified. Finally, Algorithm 4 classifies the singular points into transition and non-transition points.
In order to completely cover the interval, the increment change ∆ can be positive or negative to
allow both left and right movements from the starting point. Furthermore, we assume, for the simplicity of computation, that the domain E is bounded, i.e., E = [Emin , Emax ], where |Emin |, |Emax | < ∞.
Accordingly, the optimal value of the auxiliary problems (4) is constrained to (Emin , Emax ).
Computation of singular points and invariancy intervals Lemma 5 specifies a systematic way to approximate the boundary points of the nonsingular interval Ireg surrounding the
given ¯. The numerical detection of singular points is described
in detail in [24]

 with respect to
∗
∗
several singularity criteria, e.g., the derivative of λmin X () and λmin S () with respect to ,
or the singularity of the Jacobian of (11). We omit the details here and refer the reader to [24] for
more information on the numerical implementation of the singularity criteria.
Once a singular point is identified, the numerical solution obtained from the ODE system (16) at
the next mesh point is most likely non-optimal, due to the numerical instability or the infeasibility
of the solution. Thus, we invoke a primal-dual IPM in Algorithms 2 and 3 to compute the unique
optimal solution at the first neighboring mesh point in the remaining interval. In order to guarantee
that every singular point is correctly identified, a finer mesh pattern might be needed, and a higher
precision might be required for the computation of singular points, far beyond the double precision
arithmetic.

point, the theory of isosingular sets [25] allows one to construct a new polynomial system where
Newton’s method would converge quadratically to the singular point.
Classification of singular points The use of adaptive precision, see e.g., [6], in Bertini [5,
7] ensures that adequate precision is being used for reliable computations near the singular solutions. This method enables one to compute a maximally complementary optimal solution near
V a (ˆ
) to arbitrary accuracy. With the ability to refine the accuracy of a maximally complementary
optimal solution, we can determine if a given singular point is a transition point. This can be done
robustly by examining the rank of X ∗ () and S ∗ () using standard numerical rank revealing methods, such as singular value decomposition. More specifically, by computing the eigenvalues of an
approximate maximally complementary optimal solution at various precisions, one can determine
if the least positive eigenvalues of X ∗ () and S ∗ () converge to zero as we increase the precision of
computation. This process accurately reveals the rank of X ∗ () and S ∗ () at a singular point.

optimal set mapping fails at a transition point. Section 5.3 computes the nonlinearity interval of
the parametric SDO problem (10) where the Jacobian is singular at a non-transition point. All
numerical experiments are conducted on a PC with Intel Core i7-6500U CPU @2.5 GHz.

which can be cast into the primal form (P ), where m = 13 and X ∈ S5 . The block structure of
the matrix indicates that (17) is indeed an SDO reformulation of a parametric second-order conic

as a singleton invariancy set belonging to a nonlinearity interval.

We then invoke Algorithm 3 to track the unique optimal solutions until we locate the singular
points  = 0 and  = 1. Algorithm 3 then computes a sufficiently accurate approximation of the
singular points. Figure 4 demonstrates the exact and numerical approximation of x1 () and the
minimum modulus of the Jacobian eigenvalues versus . In particular, this tracking indicates that
the Jacobian approaches singularity near  = 0 and  = 1.
Restarting at the first mesh point next to the singular points, Algorithm 2 identifies the invariancy
intervals (− 14 , 0) and (1, 54 ) and determines that  = 0 and  = 1 are indeed the transition points of
the optimal partition.

We should point
out that while J V ∗ ( 14 ), 14 is nonsingular, there exists a singular solution V ( 41 ),

and J V ∗ (),  is singular for every maximally complementary optimal solution V ∗ () on (−∞, 0)
and (1, ∞). Nevertheless, Algorithm 1 produces the correct result even with the singular initial
point  = 14 . In this case, by Remark 4, there are finitely many singular solutions in the solution
sheet which passes through V ∗ ( 41 ).

Jacobian eigenvalues.

Using different patterns of mesh points, we demonstrate the convergence of x1 (), computed by
Algorithm 3, when  approaches the singular points  = 0 and  = 1. To that end, we let initial
∆ take values from 0.05 × 2−j for j = 0, . . . , 5 or 0.03 × 2−j for j = 0, . . . , 5, and we set  = 41 as
the initial point. Tables 1 and 2 summarize the numerical results, where the L1 error between the
exact and numerical approximation of x1 () on [ 41 , 1) and (0, 14 ], the order of convergence, and the
computation time are reported. The order of convergence is computed by

In Table 1, the singular point  = 1 is exactly identified by Algorithm 3, since the singular point
coincides with one of the mesh points. In general, however, it is unlikely that a singular point
belongs to the mesh point set. This can be observed in Table 2, where a fixed increment change
0.03 × 2−j for j = 0, . . . , 5 is utilized. In this case, the approximate singular point is taken as the last
mesh point before the minimum eigenvalues of X ∗ () or S ∗ (), obtained from the ODE system (16),

drops below 10−5 . As stated in Section 4.2, we can utilize numerical algebraic geometric tools to
compute a singular point to arbitrary accuracy.

fails to be continuous at  = 0.

function for problem (18) on [−1, 23 ].

For the purpose of numerical experiments, we consider the bounded domain [−1, 32 ]. When starting
from a nonsingular point  = 12 with a fixed increment change 0.01, Algorithm 3 properly identifies

20

 = 0 as a singular point. One could easily skip over the singular point  = 0 when simply solving
at a finite set of mesh points. Figure 5 demonstrates the exact optimal value function versus its
numerical approximation obtained from Algorithm 3. Upon refining the accuracy of the approximate singular point and obtaining the singular point  = 0, we invoke Bertini solver in Algorithm 4

to compute the dimension of all irreducible components of V F (V, 0) whichcontain V a (0). We
observe that V a (0) lies on a 1-dimensional irreducible
component of

 V F (V, 0) , and there exists a
∗
∗
∗
generic solution V (0) such that rank X (0) = 4 and rank S (0) = 2. All this indicates that the
rank of X ∗ () and S ∗ () change at  = 0, and thus  = 0 is a transition point. Consequently, we can
partition (−1, 23 ) into two nonlinearity intervals (−1, 0) and (0, 32 ) and the transition point {0}.
5.3. A non-transition point with singular Jacobian Here, we apply Algorithm 1 to
identify the singular points and the transition points of the parametric SDO problem (10) in a
bounded domain [−1, 2]. We initialize Algorithm 1 with the nonsingular point  = 0, see (7), and the
initial increment change ∆ = 0.005. While tracking forwards, Algorithm 3 computes the numerical
approximation of the unique optimal solution until it locates the singular points  = 21 and  = 32 .
Then restarting the solution tracking at 23 + ∆, Algorithm 2 identifies the invariancy interval ( 32 , 2)
and the transition point  = 32 . In an analogous fashion, while tracking backwards, Algorithm 3 and
Algorithm 2 identify the singular point  = − 12 and the invariancy interval (−1, − 21 ), respectively.
Figure 6 illustrates the exact and numerical approximation of the optimal value function, where
the singular/transition points are represented by the dots marks.

Applying Algorithm 4 to the singular point  = 21 , we can observe that V a ( 12 ) is not isolated, and it

belongs to a 1-dimensional irreducible component of V F (V, 12 ) . We then invoke the polynomial

in which rank X ∗ ( 12 ) = 3 and rank S ∗ ( 12 ) = 1. Given the rank of X ∗ () and S ∗ () on (− 12 , 12 ) ∪
( 21 , 23 ), all this implies that the singular point  = 12 belongs to the nonlinearity interval (− 12 , 23 ).
Consequently, the domain (−1, 2) is partitioned as
Uinv = (−1, − 21 ) ∪ ( 32 , 2),

Unon = (− 12 , 32 ),

Utran = {− 12 , 32 }.

6. Concluding remarks and future research This paper utilized an optimal partition
approach to parametric analysis for SDO problems, where the objective function is perturbed
along a fixed direction. In terms of continuity, we provided sufficient conditions for the existence of
nonlinearity intervals and the emptiness of the interior of the set of transition points. We showed
that the optimal set mapping might fail to be continuous on a nonlinearity interval, and the
sequence of maximally complementary optimal solutions may converge to the boundary of the
optimal set at an  in a nonlinearity interval. Under the assumption of the existence of a nonsingular
point in int(E ), we then proposed a methodology, stemming from numerical algebraic geometry,
to efficiently partition int(E ) into finite union of invariancy intervals, nonlinearity intervals, and
transition points. The computational approach was demonstrated on several examples.
We conjecture that condition (9) could fail at a boundary point of a nonlinearity interval. It is
worth providing a counterexample or sufficient conditions which guarantee the validity of (9) at
a boundary point of a nonlinearity interval. Furthermore, we still do not know about any upper
bound on the number of points at which P ∗ () or D∗ () fails to be continuous on a nonlinearity
interval, or whether the subspaces B (), T (), N () move continuously on a nonlinearity interval.
These topics are subjects of future research. We note that one could extend Theorem 2 to provide
an upper bound on the number of singular points, and hence on the number of transition points.
However, such bounds would be on the number of complex singular points, which may drastically
overestimate the number of transition points in int(E ).
