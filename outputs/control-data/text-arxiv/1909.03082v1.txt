ABSTRACT
Edge sensing with micro-power pulse-Doppler radars is an emergent domain in monitoring and surveillance with several smart city
applications. Existing solutions for the clutter versus multi-source
radar classification task are limited in terms of either accuracy or
efficiency, and in some cases, struggle with a trade-off between
false alarms and recall of sources. We find that this problem can be
resolved by learning the classifier across multiple time-scales. We
propose a multi-scale, cascaded recurrent neural network architecture, MSC-RNN, comprised of an efficient multi-instance learning
(MIL) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for clutter discrimination
at a lower tier, and a more complex RNN classifier for source classification at the upper tier. By controlling the invocation of the
upper RNN with the help of the lower tier conditionally, MSC-RNN
achieves an overall accuracy of 0.972. Our approach holistically
improves the accuracy and per-class recalls over ML models suitable for radar inferencing. Notably, we outperform cross-domain
handcrafted feature engineering with time-domain deep feature
learning, while also being up to ∼3× more efficient than a competitive solution.

INTRODUCTION

With the rapid growth in deployment of Internet of Things (IoT)
sensors in smart cities, the need and opportunity for computing
increasingly sophisticated sensing inferences on the edge has also
grown. This has motivated several advances in designing resource
efficient sensor inferences, particularly those based on machine
learning and especially deep learning. The designs, however, encounter a basic tension between achieving efficiency while preserving predictive performance that motivates a reconsideration of
state-of-the-art techniques.
In this paper, we consider a canonical inference pattern, namely
discriminating clutter from several types of sources, in the context
of a radar sensor. This sort of N +1–class classification problem,
where N is the number of source types, has a variety of smart
city applications, where diverse clutter is the norm. These include
triggering streetlights smartly, monitoring active transportation
users (pedestrians, cyclists, and scooters), crowd counting, assistive
technology for safety, and property surveillance. As an example,
streetlights should be smartly triggered on for pedestrians but
not for environmental clutter such as trees moving in the wind.
Similarly, property owners should be notified only upon a legitimate
intrusion but not for passing animals.
The radar is well suited in the smart city context as it is privacy preserving in contrast to cameras. Moreover, it consumes
low power (∼15mW), because of which it can be deployed at operationally relevant sites with little dependence on infrastructure,
using, for instance, a small panel solar harvester or even a modest
sized battery, as shown in Figure 1. Experiences with deploying
sensors in visionary smart city projects such as Chicago’s Array
of Things [7, 43] and Sounds of New York City [5] have shown
that wired deployments on poles tend to be slow and costly, given
constraints of pole access rights, agency coordination, and labor
unions, and can sometimes be in suboptimal locations. Using a

instance, radar sensing applications require that the clutter recall
be very high so that there are minimal false alarms. However, a solution that restricts false alarms at the cost of detectability (i.e., low
source recall, where a source could be either human or non-human)
would be undesirable as it would have limited applicability in the
smart city contexts discussed above.

simplifies smart city deployment.
Table 1 illustrates an efficiency-accuracy trade-off for the canonical inference pattern with N = 2, wherein clutter is distinguished
from human and other (i.e., non-human) sources. The more accurate
deep models, the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) [27] and the
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) [18], that we machine-learned for
this 3-class classifier from a reference dataset are significantly less
efficient, in terms of speed and therefore power consumption. In contrast, the more efficient shallow solution, Support Vector Machine
(SVM), is significantly less accurate. While the SVM classifier has
been implemented to operate in near real-time on the Cortex-M3
single-microcontroller processor in the device depicted in Fig. 1(a),
neither the CNN nor the LSTM per se yield a near real-time implementation. To implement deep models in near real-time on the
M3, we therefore consider model optimization with recent stateof-art-techniques such as fast gated RNNs (FastGRNN) [30] and
Early-exit Multi-Instance RNNs (EMI-LSTM and EMI-FastGRNN)
[11]. However, Table 1 illustrates that the trade-off remains: the
best accuracy we achieve, namely with the FastGRNN, has significantly lower efficiency than the best efficiency achieved, namely
with EMI-FastGRNN, but that has an accuracy that is comparatively
significantly worse.
Problem Statement. In this work, we investigate alternative optimizations of deep models for the above classification task that
achieve both high accuracy and speed. In doing so, we do not wish
to sacrifice the recall performance for achieving high precision. For

Solution Overview. The N + 1-class radar problem, where the
+1-class is clutter, conflates discrimination between classes that
are conceptually different. In other words, discriminating clutter
from sources has a different complexity from that of disambiguating
source types. This insight generalizes when the sources themselves
are related by a hierarchical ontology, wherein different levels of
source types involve concepts of correspondingly different complexity of discrimination.
By way of example, in the 3-class clutter vs. human vs. nonhuman classification problem, discriminating clutter from sources
turns out to be simpler than discriminating the more subtle differences between the source types. Using the same machine architecture for 3 classes of discrimination leads to the accuracy-efficiency
trade-off, as the last two rows of Table 1 indicate. A more complex architecture suffices for discriminating among source types
accurately, whereas a simpler architecture more efficiently suffices
for discriminating clutter from sources, but hurts the accuracy of
discriminating between source types.
We, therefore, address the problem at hand with an architecture
that decomposes the classification inference into different hierarchical sub-problems. For the 3-class problem, these are: (a) Clutter
vs Sources, and (b) Humans vs. Non-humans given Sources. For
each sub-problems we choose an appropriate learning architecture;
given the results of Table 1, both architectures are forms of RNN
albeit with learning at different time-scales. The lower tier RNN for
(a) uses a short time-scale RNN, the Early-exit Multi-Instance RNN
(EMI-FastGRNN) [11, 30], whereas the higher tier for (b) uses a
longer time-scale RNN, a FastGRNN [30], which operates at the
level of windows (contiguous, fixed-length snippets extracted from
the time-series) as opposed to short instances within the window.
The upper tier uses the features created by the lower tier as its input; for loss minimization, both tiers are jointly trained. To further
improve the efficiency, we observe that source type discrimination
needs to occur only when a source is detected and clutter may be
the norm in several application contexts. Hence, the less efficient
classifier for (b) is invoked only when (a) discriminates a source: we
refer to this as cascading between tiers. The joint training loss function is refined to emulate this cascading. We call this architecture
Multi-Scale, Cascaded RNNs (MSC-RNN).
Contributions. Our proposed architecture exploits conditional
inferencing at multiple time-scales to jointly achieve superior sensing and runtime efficiency over state-of-the-art alternatives. To the
best of our knowledge, this approach is novel to deep radar systems.
For the particular case of the 3-class problem, MSC-RNN performs
as follows on the Cortex-M3:

Its accuracy and per-class recalls are mostly better than, and in
remaining cases competitive with, the models in Table 1. Likewise,
its efficiency is competitive with that of EMI-FastGRNN, the most
efficient of all models, while substantially outperforming it in terms
of sensing quality. We also validate that this MSC-RNN solution is
superior to its shallow counterparts not only comprehensively, but
at each individual tier as well. The data and training code for this
project are open-sourced at [39].
Other salient findings from our work are summarized as follows:
(1) Even with deep feature learning purely in the time-domain,
MSC-RNN surprisingly outperforms handcrafted feature engineering in the amplitude, time, and spectral domains for
the source separation sub-problem. Further, this is achieved
with 1.75-3× improvement in the featurization overhead.
(2) The Tier 1 component of MSC-RNN, which classifies legitimate sources from clutter, improves detectability by up to
2.6× compared to popular background rejection mechanisms
in radar literature, even when the false alarm rate is controlled to be ultra-low.
(3) MSC-RNN seems to tolerate the data imbalance among its
source types better than other compared RNN models. In
particular, it enhances the non-dominant human recall by
up to 20%, while simultaneously maintaining or improving
the dominant non-human recall and overall accuracy.
Organization. In Section 2, we present related research and outline the basics of micro-power radar sensing in Section 3. In Section
4, we detail the various components in our solution and discuss
the training and inference pipelines. We provide evaluation and
prototype implementation details in Sections 5 and 6 respectively.
We conclude and motivate future research in Section 7.

RELATED WORK

Shallow Radar Sensing. Micro-Doppler features have been used
in myriad applications ranging from classification [16, 23, 32] to
regression [15]. Most of these applications employ the short-time
Fourier transform (STFT) representation for analyzing micro-Doppler
signatures. Although shallow classifiers can be computationally
cheaper than deep solutions, the spectrogram generation over a sliding window for the STFT incurs significant computational overhead
for real-time applications on single microcontroller devices. In order
to decrease this overhead for feature extraction, different feature extraction methods like linear predictive coding [20], discrete-cosine
coefficients [34], log-Gabor filters with principal component analysis [31], empirical mode decomposition [36] have been investigated
in the past. We, on the other hand, use a deep learning approach
that learns relevant features from raw time-series data, and avoid
spectrogram computation altogether. Feature engineering requires
sophisticated domain knowledge, is not assured to be efficient per
se, and may not transfer well to solutions for other research problems. Moreover, selection of relevant and non-redundant features
requires care for sensing to be robust [40].
Deep Radar Sensing. In recent years, there has been significant use of deep learning for radar applications. Most works use
spectrogram-based input [21, 24, 25] with deep architectures like
CNNs/autoencoders. The authors of [33] digitize the radio receiver’s

signal and generate a unique spectral correlation function for the
Deep Belief Network to learn signatures from. The pre-processing
needed in these applications and the resulting model sizes make
them unsuitable for single microcontroller devices. We use raw
time-series data in conjunction with variants of RNNs to achieve a
faster and efficient solution.
Efficient RNN. The ability of RNNs in learning temporal features
has made it ubiquitous in various sequence modeling tasks. RNNs,
albeit theoretically powerful, often fail to reach the best performance due to instability in their training resulting from the exploding and vanishing gradient problem (EVGP) [37]. Gated RNNs
like LSTM [18] and GRU [9] have been proposed to circumvent
EVGP and achieve the desired accuracy for the given task. A drawback of LSTM and GRU is their model size and compute overhead
which makes them unattractive for the near real-time single microcontroller implementations. Recently, FastGRNN [30] has been
proposed to achieve prediction accuracies comparable to LSTM and
GRU while ensuring that the learned models are smaller than 10
KB for diverse tasks. Our proposed hierarchical classifier solution
is based on this architecture.
Multi-Instance Learning and Early Classification. MIL is a
weakly supervised learning technique that is used to label subinstances of a window. MIL has found use in applications from
vision [45] to natural language processing (NLP) [26]. It enables
a reduction in the computational overhead of sequential models
like RNNs by localizing the appropriate activity signature in a
given noisy and coarsely-labeled time-series data along with early
detection or rejection of a signal [11]. We use it as our lower tier
classifier for clutter versus source discrimination.
Multi-Scale RNN. One of the early attempts to learn structure in
temporally-extended sequences involved using reduced temporal
sequences [17] to make detectability over long temporal intervals
feasible in recurrent networks [35, 41]. With the resurgence of
RNNs, multi-scale RNNs can discover the latent hierarchical multiscale structure of sequences [10]. While they have been traditionally
used to capture long-term dependencies, we use it to design a computationally efficient system. We use different scales of temporal
windows for the lower and upper tier RNN. By conditioning the
upper tier classifier, which works on longer windows and is hence
bulkier we make sure that the former is invoked only when necessary, i.e., when the lower tier predicts a source.
Compression Techniques. Sparsity, low-rank, and quantization
have been proven to be effective ways of compressing deep architectures like RNNs [44, 46] and CNNs [14, 29]. Many other
compression methods like householder reflectors in Spectral-RNN
[47], Kronecker factorization in KRU [22] have been proposed,
which are complementary to the solution proposed in this paper.
We incorporate low-rank representation, Q15 quantization, and
piecewise-linear approximation [30] to make MSC-RNN realizable
on Cortex-M3 microcontrollers.

Classifier Architectures

3.2.1 Input and Feature Representation. The radar classifier system
uses the aforementioned complex time-series as input. Extant endto-end architectures for micro-power radar sensing mostly eschew
deep feature learning for cheap handcrafted feature engineering in
the amplitude, time, and spectral domains [15, 40]. However, these
solutions incur significant featurization overhead; this is exemplified in Table 2 on 1-second snippets extracted from the complex
time-series. Even ignoring the SVM computation latency, it can
be seen that the main computation bottleneck is this incremental
overhead which results in >30% duty cycle on the Cortex-M3, of
which ∼10% constitutes the FFT overhead alone.

3.2.3 Shallow Classifier Architecture. As shown in Figure 2, a prototypical shallow radar classifier system consists of three subsystems:
(i) a displacement detector for discriminating clutter vs. sources, (ii)
an incremental featurizer, (iii) an end inference engine that discriminates source types, and (iv) a composition manager that handles
their interactions. The displacement detector is a simple module
that thresholds unwrapped phase over incoming windows of radar
data ( 12 s or 1 s) to detect legitimate source displacements in the
scene, filtering in-situ clutter that tends to yield self-canceling phase
unwraps. When a source displacement is speculatively detected,
the featurizer is invoked till the current displacement ends or a prespecified time limit is reached. The final feature vector is fed to an
end classifier such as Support Vector Machine [40]. Note that incremental feature computation overhead is the primary impediment
in realizing efficiency in these systems, hence techniques like replacing the heavy SVM classifier with the much lighter Bonsai [28],

While we preserve this ontological hierarchy in our solution,
we replace this simple “ensemble" with a principled 2-tier RNN
approach in the time-domain. In the next sections, we present our
proposed architecture and discuss how deep feature learning can
be used to successfully resolve the above issues.

2-TIER DEEP CLASSIFIER ARCHITECTURE

MSC-RNN is a multi-scale, cascaded architecture that uses EMIFastGRNN as the lower tier clutter discriminator and FastGRNN
as the upper tier source classifier. While EMI-FastGRNN efficiently
localizes the source signature in a clutter prone time-series ensuring
smaller sequential inputs along with early classification, FastGRNN
reduces the per-step computational overhead over much heavier
alternatives such as LSTM. We begin with the relevant background
for each of these components.

4.1
3.2.2 Deep Classifier Architecture. Deep radar classifier systems
such as CNNs (or even some RNNs) convert the raw time-series
to STFT, and hence also maintain this steady overhead in input
representation. In the interest of designing resource efficient solutions, in this work, we instead focus on being competitive with
all-domain featurization using purely time-domain learning.

Displacement Detector

Time Limit

short-range radar with an anisotropic radiation pattern yielding a
maximum detection range of ∼13 m. Sensing itself consumes 15mW
of power, not counting the inference computation on the associated
microcontroller. The radar response is low pass filtered to 100 Hz;
hence the output is typically sampled at rates over 200Hz.
The output signal from the radar is a complex time-series with
In-phase (I) and Quadrature (Q) components. When a source moves
within the detection range, in addition to the change in received
power, the phase of this signal changes according to the direction
of motion. Consequently, its relative displacement can be estimated
with high accuracy (typically, sub-cm scale), and a rich set of features can be derived by tracking its phase evolution over time.

Candidate Classifiers

FastGRNN. FastRNN [30] provably stabilizes RNN training by
helping to avoid EVGP by using only two additional scalars over
the traditional RNN. FastGRNN is built over FastRNN and it extends the scalars of FastRNNs to vector gates while maximizing
the computation reuse. FastGRNN also ensures its parameter matrices are low-rank, sparse and byte quantized to ensure very small
models and very fast computation. FastGRNN is shown to match
the accuracies of state-of-the-art RNNs (LSTM and GRU) across
various tasks like keyword spotting, activity recognition, sentiment
analysis, and language modeling while being up to 45x faster.
Let X = [x1 , x2 , . . . , xT ] be the input time-series, where x t ∈ RD .
The traditional RNN’s hidden vector ht ∈ RD̂ captures long-term
dependencies of the input sequence: ht = tanh(Wxt + Uht −1 + b).
Typically, learning U and W difficult due to the gradient instability.
FastGRNN (Figure 3(a)) uses a scalar controlled peephole connection
for every coordinate of ht :
ht = (ζ (1 − zt ) + ν ) ⊙ tanh(Wxt + Uht −1 + bh ) + zt ⊙ ht −1 ,
zt = σ (Wxt + Uht −1 + bz )
Here, 0 ≤ ζ , ν ≤ 1 are trainable parameters, and ⊙ represents the
vector Hadamard product.

EMI-RNN. Time-series signals when annotated are rarely precise
and often coarsely labeled due to various factors like human errors
and smaller time frames of activities themselves. EMI-RNN [11]
tackles the problem of signal localization using MIL, by splitting
the i th data window into instances {Z i,τ }τ =1, ...T −ω+1 of a fixed
width ω (Figure 3(b)). The algorithm alternates between training
the classifier and re-labeling the data based on the learned classier
until convergence. A simple thresholding scheme is applied to
refine the instances: in each iteration, k consecutive instances are
found with maximum prediction sum for the class label. Only these
instances are included in the training set for the next iteration. Here,
k is a hyperparameter that intuitively represents the number of
instances expected to cover the source signature. In the end, EMIRNN produces precise signal signatures which are much smaller
than the raw input, thus reducing the computation and memory
overhead over the traditional sequential techniques. EMI-RNN also
ensures early detection of noise or keywords thereby removing the
need of going through the entire signal before making a decision.
When combined, EMI-FastGRNN provides very small models along
with very fast inference for time-series classification tasks. Codes
for FastGRNN [30] & EMI-RNN [11] are part of Microsoft Research
India’s EdgeML repository [12].

4.2

MSC-RNN Design

While EMI-RNN is by itself equipped to handle multi-class classification efficiently, we find its accuracy and non-dominant source recall
to be sub-optimal for the radar time-series, especially at smaller
hidden dimensions and shorter window lengths. FastGRNN, on the
other hand, is a relatively heavier solution to be used as a continuously running 3-class discriminator. To redress this trade-off, we
make the following observations:
(i) clutter, which yields self-canceling phase, can be rejected at
a relatively shorter time-scale,
(ii) disambiguating source types from their complex returns is
a harder problem requiring a potentially longer window of
observation, and
(iii) the common case in a realistic deployment constitutes clutter;
legitimate displacements are relatively few.
MSC-RNN, therefore, handles the two sub-problems at different time-scales of featurization (see Figure 4): the lower tier, an
EMI-FastGRNN, discriminates sources from clutter at the level of
short instances, while the upper one, a windowed FastGRNN, discriminates source types at the level of longer windows. Further, the
upper tier is invoked only when a source is discriminated by the
lower tier and operates on the instance-level embeddings generated
by the latter.
4.2.1 Joint Training and Inference. The training of the lower tier
inherits from that of EMI-training. We recap its training algorithm

Figure 4: MSC-RNN architecture – the lower EMI-FastGRNN
runs continuously, while the higher FastGRNN is invoked
only for legitimate displacements
[11], which occurs in two phases, the MI phase and the EMI phase.
In the MI phase, where the source boundaries are refined in a clutterprone window, the following objective function is optimized:
1Õ
1τ ∈[si ,si +k ] ℓ(fl (Zi,τ ), yi )
min

fl ,s i
i,τ
Here, ℓ represents the loss function of FastGRNN, and the classifier fl is based on the final time-step in an instance. In the EMI
phase, which incorporates the early stopping, the loss LEMI is obtained by replacing the previous loss function with the sum of the
T
ÍÍ
classifier loss at every step: min
ℓ(w T oi,t ), where w is the
i t =1

fully connected layer and oi,t the output at step t. The overall training proceeds in several rounds, where the switch to the EMI loss
function is typically made halfway in.
For training the upper tier, in keeping with the divide-andconquer paradigm of MSC-RNN, the upper tier FastGRNN cell
should only learn to separate the source types, while ignoring instances of training data that are clutter. Therefore, we devise a
conditional training strategy that captures the cascading behavior.
To achieve this, the standard cross-entropy loss function of the
upper tier is modified as:
1Õ

min
1yi ,−1 ℓ(fu (E({Zi,τ

where fu represents the upper classifier, and E : R(T −ω+1)×ω×F →
R(T −ω+1)×Hl represents the instance-level embedding vector from
EMI-RNN with a hidden dimension of Hl (here, F represents the
feature dimension for the radar time-series). Intuitively, this means
that the upper loss is unaffected by clutter points, and thus the tiers
can be kept separate.
The training algorithm for MSC-RNN is outlined in Algorithm 1.
The two tiers are first separately initialized using their respective
loss functions, and in the final phase, both are jointly trained to minimize the sum of their losses. Inference is simple: the instance-level
EMI-RNN stops early with a decision of “Source” when a probability threshold p̂ is crossed; ≥ k consecutive positives constitute a
discrimination for which the cascade is activated.

Table 3(a) lists the radar source and clutter datasets collected in
various indoor and outdoor environments, which are used in this
work. Some of these locations are documented in Figure 5; small or
crammed indoor spaces such as office cubicles have been avoided
to prevent the radar returns from being adversely affected by multipath effects and because they are not central to the smart city
scenarios. A partial distribution of displacement durations is provided in Figure 6(a). Each data collect has associated with it the
corresponding ground truth, recorded with motion-activated trail
cameras or cellphone video cameras, with which the radar data
was correlated offline to “cut” and label the source displacement
snippets appropriately1 . The datasets have been balanced in the

radar dataset, which we have open-sourced, does not include individually identifiable information of living individuals and is thus not considered research with

Evaluation Methodology

Our proposed architecture is compared with existing shallow radar
solutions that use feature handcrafting in the amplitude, phase
and spectral domains, as well as with other MIL RNNs. In all cases
involving RNNs, the radar data is represented purely in the timedomain. The models chosen for this evaluation are:
(a) 2-tier SVM with phase unwrapped displacement detection. Phase unwrapping [13] is a widely used technique in
radar displacement detection due to its computational efficiency. The idea is to construct the relative trajectory of a

Results

5.3.1 Comparative Classifier Performance. We compare the inference accuracy and recalls of MSC-RNN, with the RNN and shallow
solutions outlined in Section 5.2.
Recall that we have purposefully devised a purely time-domain
solution for source discrimination for efficiency reasons, since one
of the main components of featurization overhead is that of FFT
computations. Figure 7 compares MSC-RNN with engineered features in the amplitude, time, and spectral domains that are optimized for micro-power radar classification. For the two-tier SVM,
the source recalls for increasing window sizes are inferred from
Figure 8 (discussed in Section 5.3.3). We find that MSC-RNN significantly outperforms the 2-tier SVM solution in terms of human
and non-human recalls, even with features learned from the raw
time-series. Similarly, for the 3-class case, our solution provides
much more stable noise robustness and is generally superior even
to the much heavier SVM solution.

5.2.1 Hyperparameters. Table 4 lists the hyperparameter combinations used in our experiments. For the upper-tier source discrimination comparison in Section 5.3.3, FastGRNN is also allowed to
select its optimum input length from 16, 32, and 64 samples.
The selection of the EMI hyperparameter k merits some discussion, in that it controls the extent of “strictness" we assign to the
definition of displacement. A higher k makes it more difficult for
a current window to be classified as a source unless the feature of
interest is genuinely compelling. Expectedly, this gives a trade-off
between clutter and source recall as is illustrated in Figure 6(b). As
explained in Section 1, controlling for false positives is extremely
important in radar sensing contexts such as intrusion detection.
Hence, we empirically set k to 10, the smallest value that gives a
clutter recall of 0.999 or higher in our windowed datasets.

Model

source by accumulating differences in successive phase measurements, whereby clutter can be filtered out. We contrast
MSC-RNN with a two-tier solution proposed in [40], which
uses a robust variant of phase unwrapping with adaptive
filtering of clutter samples.
(b) 3-class SVM. A clutter vs human vs non-human SVM solution that uses feature handcrafting.
(c) EMI-FastGRNN. An EMI version of FastGRNN (Section 4).
(d) EMI-LSTM. An EMI version of the LSTM. Note that this is
a much heavier architecture than the former, and should not
be regarded as suitable for a microcontroller device.
Since shallow featurization incurs high incremental overhead,
real-time micro-power radar solutions typically avoid techniques
such as PCA [6], logistic regression [19] or low-dimensional projection [28]. Instead, the 15 best features are selected using the Max.
Relevance, Min. Redundancy (mRMR) [38] algorithm.
For the MIL experiments, the windowed data from Table 3(b)
is further reshaped into instances of length 48×2 samples with
a fixed stride of 16×2, where 2 refers to the number of features
(I and Q components of radar data). For example, for 1 second
windows, the shape of the training data for MIL experiments is
(17055, 14, 48, 2), and the shape of the corresponding instance-level
one-hot labels is (17055, 14, 3). In the interest of fairness and also to
avoid a combinatorial exploration of architectural parameters, we
present results at fixed hidden sizes of 16, 32, and 64. For MSC-RNN,
the lower tier’s output (embedding) dimension and upper tier’s
hidden dimension are kept equal; however, in practice, it is easy
to parameterize them differently since the former only affects the
latter’s input dimension.

Figure 9 contrasts our model with 3-class EMI-FastGRNN and
EMI-LSTM, for fixed hidden sizes of 16, 32, and 64 respectively.
It can be seen that MSC-RNN outperforms the monolithic EMI
algorithms on all three metrics of accuracy, non-human and human
recalls (with one exception for EMI-LSTM). Notably, cascading
significantly enhances the non-dominant class recall over the other
methods, especially for larger hidden sizes, and therefore offers
better resilience to the source type imbalance in radar datasets.

5.3.2 Runtime Efficiency Comparison - MSC-RNN vs. Feature Handcrafting. Table 5 lists the runtime duty cycle estimates of MSCRNN versus shallow SVM alternatives in two deployment contexts
with realistic clutter conditions, supported by usage statistics of
a popular biking trail in Columbus, OH [2]. While the 2-tier SVM
understandably has the lowest duty cycle due to a cheap lower
tier, it is not a competitive solution as established in Section 5.3.1.
The 3-class SVM, on the other hand, is dominated by the feature
computation overhead. While the 48×2 MSC-RNN formulation is
about 1.75× as efficient as using handcrafted features, it is possible
to reduce instance-level computations even further by using longer
input vectors and reducing the number of iterations. As an example,
MSC-RNN with a 16-dimensional input vector is 3× more efficient
than feature engineering.

the lower-layer EMI-FastGRNN. Table 6 compares its performance
with the upper-tier SVM from the latter when trained with the best
15 cross-domain features obtained from the raw radar samples. It
can be seen that the purely time-domain FastGRNN still generally
outperforms the 2-class SVM on all three metrics of accuracy, human recall, and non-human recall. Thus, it is possible to replace
feature engineering with deep feature learning and enjoy the dual
benefits of improved sensing and runtime efficiency for this class
of radar applications.

5.3.3 Tier-wise Evaluation. We next compare the lower-tier and
upper-tier classifiers individually to their shallow counterparts in
the 2-tier SVM solution.
Tier 1 Classifier. Figure 8 compares the probabilities of missed detects versus displacement durations for the 3-outof-4 displacement
detector and the EMI component of our solution with 2-second
windows (for a principled approach to choosing parameters for
the former, refer to Appendix A) at hidden sizes of 16, 32, and
64. It can be seen that, for the shortest cut length of 1.5 s in the
dataset, the detection probability is improved by up to 1.5× (1.6×)
over the 3-outof-4 detector with false alarm rates of 1/week and
1/month respectively even when the false alarm rate (1−test clutter
recall) of EMI is 0, which translates to a false alarm rate of <1 per
year. Further, the EMI detector converges to 0 false detects with
displacements ≥2.5 s, and is therefore able to reliably detect walks
2.6× shorter than the previous solution. Therefore, it is possible to
restrict false positives much below 1/month while significantly improving detectability over the M-outof-N solution. Since the clutter
and source datasets span various backgrounds (Figure 5), MSC-RNN
offers superior cross-environmental robustness.
Tier 2 Classifier. We now show that the gains of MSC-RNN over
the 2-tier SVM solution are not, in fact, contingent on the quality of

LOW-POWER IMPLEMENTATION

The radar sensor described in Figure 1(a) uses an ARM Cortex-M3
microcontroller with 96 KB of RAM and 4 MB of flash storage. It
runs eMote [42], a low-jitter near real-time operating system with
a small footprint. We emphasize that energy efficient compute, not
working memory or storage, is the bigger concern for efficient
real-time operation. Hence, we take several measures to efficiently
implement the multi-scale RNN to run at a low duty cycle on the device. These include low-rank representation of hidden states, Q15
quantization, and piecewise-linear approximations of non-linear
functions. The latter in particular ensures that all the computations
can be performed with integer arithmetic when the weights and
inputs are quantized. For example, tanh(x) can be approximated as:
quantT anh(x) = max(min(x, 1), −1), and siдmoid(x) can be approximated as: quantSiдm(x) = max(min( x +1
2 , 1), 0). The underlying
linear algebraic operations are implemented using the CMSIS-DSP
library [1]. While advanced ARM processors such as Cortex-M4
offer floating point support, it should be noted that, for efficiency
reasons, using sparse, low rank matrices and quantization techniques are beneficial in general.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK

In this work, we introduce multi-scale, cascaded RNNs for radar
sensing, and show how leveraging the ontological decomposition
of a canonical classification problem into clutter vs. source classification, followed by source type discrimination on an on-demand
basis can improve both sensing quality as well as runtime efficiency
over alternative systems. Learning discriminators at the time-scales
relevant to their respective tasks, and jointly training the discriminators while being cognizant of the cascading behavior between
them yields the desired improvement.
The extension of MSC-RNNs to more complicated sensing contexts is a topic of future work. Of interest are regression-based radar
“counting” problems such as occupancy estimation or active transportation monitoring, where the competitiveness of MSC-RNN to
architectures such as TCNs [4] could be insightful. We also believe
that MSC-RNN could also apply to alternative sensing for smart
cities and built environments where the sources have intrinsic ontological hierarchies, such as in urban sound classification [5].

Figure 10: Shallow displacement detector parameter selection using the datasets from Table 3(a): here, M=3 and N=4
We discuss the parameter selection process for the unwrappedphase displacement detector [40] referenced in Figures 7 and 8 in a
principled manner. Figure 10(a) shows the cumulative distribution
of unwrapped phase changes of environmental clutter, translated
into real distance units, in various environments for 12 second integration windows from the clutter datasets in Table 3(a). The data is
extrapolated using linear fitting on a logarithmic scale to estimate
the required phase thresholds to satisfy false alarm rates of 1 per
week and 1 per month respectively (derived using Bernoulli probabilities). We see that the unwrapped thresholds for 1 false alarm
per week and month correspond to 0.3 and 0.32 m respectively. In
this analysis, we fix the IQ rejection parameter at 0.9, which gives
us the most lenient thresholds.
Figure 10(b) illustrates the CCDFs of phase displacements for all
target types (humans, gym balls, dogs, cattle, and slow-moving vehicles) in our dataset combined, calculated over 12 second windows.
Setting thresholds based on the previous analysis, the probability
of false negatives per window is still significant. In practice, the
algorithm improves detection by basing its decision on 3-outof-4
sliding windows, where the miss probability improves since the
threshold per window is now 34 × the original threshold. For 1 false
alarm per week (month), the displacement threshold for the 3-outof4 detector reduces to 0.22 m (0.24 m) per window, with an improved
miss probability of 0.59 (0.62).
