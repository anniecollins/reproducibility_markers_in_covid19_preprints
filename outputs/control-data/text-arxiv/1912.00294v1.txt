The first time that the connection between isometric immersion of surfaces and solutions of the Dirac equation appeared in the literature was in the seminal paper
of Thomas Friedrich in 1998. In consequence of that, several authors contributed
to this topic hereafter, by obtaining the spinorial representation of Spin manifolds
with arbitrary dimension and also by presenting a generalization of the Weierstrass
representation map, for example. All these results assume that the manifolds and
bundles involved carry a Spin structure, however this hypothesis is somehow restrictive, as for instance, if we consider complex manifolds, it is more natural to consider
SpinC structures. There exist an alternative to adapt this result to SpinC manifolds,
where the idea is to use the left regular representation of a Clifford algebra in itself
to build the spinor bundles, but unlike the original works of Friedrich and Morel, this
representation is not irreducible. Thus, this paper aims to present the spinorial representation of SpinC manifolds into Euclidian space with arbitrary dimensions using
spinors that came from an irreducible representation of a complex Clifford algebra.

INTRODUCTION
The Weierstrass map is a classic method to use complex functions on the construction of

minimal surfaces in the euclidean 3 space. On the seminal paper5 , Thomas Friedrich shows
that the Weierstrass map has relation with spinors and the Dirac equation. His idea was to
consider an immersion M 2 ֒→ R3 of an oriented surface M 2 and fix a parallel spinor Φ on
R3 . By restriction, a Spin structure on R3 canonically induces a Spin structure into M 2 .
Restricting Φ to M 2 , Friedrich produces a specific spinorial field ϕ, with constant norm and
that is solution of homogeneous Dirac equation D(ϕ) = Hϕ. On the other hand, given a
solution ϕ from Dirac equation, with constant norm, there is a symmetrical endomorphism
2

E : T (M 2 ) → T (M 2 ) such that the spinorial field satisfies a “twistor equation” ∇M
X ϕ =
2

E(X) · ϕ, where ∇M is the induced connection in the spinor bundle of M 2 . Friedrich shows
that a solution of this twistor equation is equivalent to Gauss and Codazzi equations of
isometric immersions. As a consequence, the solution ϕ of the Dirac equation D(ϕ) =
Hϕ, |ϕ| = const > 0 produces an isometric immersion of M 2 in R3 .
The main result demonstrated by Friedrich in his paper is
Theorem 1. Let (M 2 , g) a 2 -dimensional oriented Riemannian manifold and H : M 2 → R
a smooth map. Then the following statements are equivalent:
(a) There is an isometric immersion (M̃ 2 , g) → R3 of the universal covering M̃ 2 of M 2
in R3 with mean curvature H.
(b) There is a solution ϕ, with constant norm |ϕ| = 1, of Dirac equation Dϕ = Hϕ.
(c) There is a pair (ϕ, E) consisting of a symmetric endomorphism E such that
2

tr(E) = −H and a spinorial field ϕ such that ∇M
X ϕ = E(X) · ϕ.
Since Friedrich’s work numerous works appeared,2–4,7–9,12,13 , showing how Dirac equations,
spinors, Gauss-Codazzi equations and isometric immersions are related on manifolds of low
dimension. In recent years, Bayard, Lawn and Roth4 , using the left regular represantation
of the Clifford Algebra on itself, generalized the spinorial Weierstrass map to manifolds of
arbitrary dimension.
More precisely, let M a p-dimensional Riemannian manifold, E → M a real vector bundle
of rank q with metric and compatible connection. It is assumed that T M and E are oriented
2

and Spin, with Spin structures given by PSpinp (T M) −→ PSOp (T M) and PSpinq (E) −→
PSOq (E), where PSOp (T M) and PSOq (E) are the positively oriented frame bundles of T M
and E. It is considered the following Spinp × Spinq -principal bundle over M PSpinp ×Spinq :=
PSpinp (T M)×M PSpinq (E), and the following associated fiber bundle Σ := PSpinp ×Spinq ×ρ Cln ,
UΣ := PSpinp ×Spinq ×ρ Spinn ⊂ Σ, where ρ is the left regular representation and n = p + q.
Noting that the product hh·, ·ii : Cln × Cln → Cln , hhξ, ξ ′ii = τ (ξ ′ )ξ, where Cln is the ndimensional real Clifford algebra and τ is the reversion on the algebra, is Spinn -invariante,
the authors considered de induced Cln -valued product hh·, ·ii : Σ × Σ → Cln , given by
the expression hhϕ, ψii = τ ([ϕ′ ])[ϕ]. where ϕ = [p, [ϕ]] ∈ Γ(Σ), ϕ′ = [p, [ϕ′ ]] ∈ Γ(Σ) and
p ∈ Γ(PSpinp ×Spinq ) is a spinorial frame.
Using these structures the main resut of Bayard, Lawn and Roth4 can be stated as
Theorem 2. Let M be a simply connected Riemannian p-dimensional manifold, E → M a
real vector bundle of rank q with metric and compatible connection, suppose that T M and
E are oriented and spin. Let B : T M × T M → E a bilinear and symmetric form. Then the
following statements are equivalent:
1. There exists a section ϕ ∈ Γ(UΣ) such that
p

1X
∇ ϕ=−
ej · B(X, ej ) · ϕ, ∀ X ∈ Γ(T M).
2 j=1
Σ

2. There exists an isometric immersion F : M → Rn with normal bundle E and second
fundamental form B.
Besides that, dF = ξ, where ξ is the Rn -valued 1-form defined by
ξ(X) = hhX · ϕ, ϕii ∈ Rn ⊂ Cln , ∀X ∈ Γ(T M).
This expression generalizes the classic Weierstrass representation formula.
The assumption that the manifold carries a Spin-structure is somewhat restrictive, for
example, in the particular case of complex manifolds, is more natural to consider SpinC structures. In the recent work of Leao and Wainer11 , it was demonstrated that the above
solution can also be refined to SpinC -structures.
Looking for the development of this problem we can note that the initial works on low
dimensions5,12 usualy utilizes irreducible representations of the Clifford Algebras. On the
3

other hand the generalizations4,11 need an algebraic propertie of the left regular representation which is not an irreducible one. This difference with the fact that the Clifford Algebras
are semi-simple, wich implies that every representation is completly reducible, raises the
question if we can describe the Weierstrass map on higher dimensions using irreducible
spinors.
In the present work we proved that it is possible to consider irreducible representations
as long as we consider more then one solution of the Dirac equation. To show this, in the
section II we present some algebric preliminaries on Clifford algebras ideals, Spin and SpinC
groups; in the section III we adapt the idea presented in1 to SpinC submanifolds relating
the connections on the adapted SpinC structures (2); in section IV we fix our notation, in
order to take advantage of the multiplicative structure in the Clifford algebra and at the
same time keep the Spin representation comming from an irreducible representation, we
build the spinor bundles from complex Clifford algebras ideals; in section V we define a Cvalued hermitian product using the Clifford algebra structure of the SpinC -Clifford bundle;
finally in VI we present our result Theorem 4 that gives a spinorial representation of SpinC
submanifolds in Rn using irreducible complex Clifford algebra spinors.

ALGEBRIC PRELIMINARIES
Here we denote by Cln the real Clifford Algebra on Rn and by Cln = C ⊗Cln its complex-

ification. For each n, let νn the number of non-equivalent irreducible real representations
of Cln and denote by νnC the number of non-equivalent irreducible complex representations
of Cln . Let dn = dimR W where W is an irreducible R-module of Cln . Analogously be
dCn = dimR S where S is an irreducible C-module of Cln and therefore also of Cln .
The following classification is well known10 :
Theorem 3. For 1 ≤ n ≤ 8 the values of νn , νnC , dn , dCn are given by Table I.
For n > 8 it can be calculated using (m, k ≥ 1):

The SpinC group

Definition 1. The SpinCn group is defined by
SpinCn =

Spinn × S 1
,
{(−1, −1)}

where S 1 = U(1) ⊂ C denotes the complex unitary group.
This is better understood within the complex Clifford algebra Cln = C ⊗ Cln . First note
that Spinn and S 1 are subgroups of the group of invertible elements in Cln and Spinn ∩S 1 =
{1, −1}. Therefore the elements in SpinCn are equivalenceses classes in Spinn × S 1 by the
relation (p, s) ∼
= (−p, −s), obtained from −1 ∈ Cln . Then we have the following
SpinCn ֒→ Cln ⊗ C = Cln ,
[P, s] 7→ p ⊗ s.
For the group SpinCn in this work we will define the following homomorphisms:
λn : Spinn → SOn the double cover λn (u)(v) := uvu−1
λCn : SpinCn → SOn , defined by λCn ([p, s]) = λn (p).
iCn : Spinn → SpinCn the natural inclusion, iCn (p) = [p, 1].
jnC : S 1 → SpinCn the natural inclusion, jnC (s) = [1, s].
lnC : SpinCn → S 1 defined by lnC ([p, s]) = s2 .
pCn = λCn × lnC : SpinCn → SOn × S 1 defined by lnC ([p, s]) = (λn (p), s2 ).
5

Then we have the following exact sequence for the SpinCn group:

Spin representation

n is odd.
Define ρCn the complex Spin representation as the restriction of ρ̄Cn given by the inclusions
Spinn ⊂ Cln0 ⊂ Cln ⊂ Cln ,
ρCn : = ρ̄Cn

Spinn

: Spinn → EndC (S).

We say that S carries the Spinn representation.
When n is odd, the definition (1) of ρCn is independent of which irreducible representation
of Cln . Furthermore, when n is odd, ρCn is irreducible.
When n is even, there exist a decomposition
ρCn = ρCn

+

⊕ ρCn

as the sum of two non-equivalent irreducible complex representations of Spinn .
In order to simplify the notation, where there is no likelihood of confusion, we simply
denote ρ̄Cn = ρCn = ρn .

ADAPTED SpinC STRUCTURE

In this work whenever we use the noun submanifold we are referring to the concept of
immersed submanifold. Remember that a manifold M is immersed submanifold of N if there
is an injective smooth map F : M → N with injective derivative dF : T M → T N (14 22).

It will be relevant for our study to consider the following inclusion n = p + q:
SO(p) × SO(q) ⊂ SO(p + q)
(λp (u), λq (w)) : Rp × Rq → Rp × Rq
(λp (u), λq (w))(v1 , v2 ) = (λp (u)v1 , λq (w)v2 ).
Definition 2. We define the adapted Spin group as
Sn := {uv; u ∈ Spinp , v ∈ Spinq } ⊂ Spinn
and note that Sn = λ−1
n (SO(p) × SO(q)) and Sn ≃

Note that λn |Sn : S → SO(p) × SO(q) is a double cover map
λn |Sn (uw)(v1, v2 ) = λn (uw)(v1 + v2 ) =
uw(v1 + v2 )w −1u−1 = uv1 u−1 + wv2 w −1 = (uv1 u−1, wv2 w −1 ),
identify (v1 , v2 ) ∈ Rp × Rq with v1 + v2 ∈ Rn .
Here we adapt the idea presented in1 to SpinC submanifolds. Let Q an n-dimensional
riemannian SpinC manifold and M ֒→ Q an p-dimensional SpinC submanifold. Put in M
the induced metric from Q. Consider PSO(n) the bundle of positively oriented frames of Q
and PSO(p) the bundle of positively oriented frames of M. PS 1 is the S 1 -principal bundle
associated with the SpinC structure of Q and PS11 is the S 1 -principal bundle associated with
the SpinC of M.

Let e1 , ..., ep a local positively oriented base of tangent bundle of M, and f1 , ..., fq a local
positively oriented base of normal bundle E. Fix

CLIFFORD ALGEBRA IDEAL SPINORS

a 7→ ρni;λ (a) : βfi;λ 7→ aβfi;λ,

for the case n = 2k + 1 odd,

Their restrictions to SpinCn will also be denoted by ρni or ρni;λ . Remember that the representations ρn1 ≃ · · · ≃ ρn2k are equivalent, as well as ρn1;λ ≃ · · · ≃ ρn2k ;λ , λ = 0, 1.
In what follows, always considering the parities of m and n, we suppress indexes i, j, l
when there is no risk of confusion. A more detailed description of the bundles below can be
found in the A.
Given these irreducible representations, we define the following complex spinors bundles:
XC

M : = PSpinCp ×ρp I p ,

XC

Q : = PSpinCn ×ρn I n ,

XC

E := PSpinCq ×ρq I q ,

XC

Q
M

:= PSpinCn

M

×ρn I n .

From1 (pp. 5) we can compare the spinor modules of the Clifford algebra of a direct sum
with the spinor modules associated with each factor. Besides that, using the fact that the
transition functions of PSpinCn

M

are the product of the transition functions of PSpinCp and

PSpinCq , it’s not difficult to get:

A C-VALUED HERMITIAN PRODUCT ON THE SPINOR BUNDLE

V.

Let’s define the following antiautomorphism
τ : Cln → Cln
τ (a ei1 ei2 · · · eik ) : = (−1)k ā eik · · · ei2 ei1 ,
where {e1 , · · · en } is an orthonormal basis of Rn ⊂ Cln and a ∈ C. For simplicity, we can
¯ ξ ∈ Cln .
write τ (ξ) = ξ,

Lemma 1. When we consider the isomorphism (sec. II C) of Cln with C(2 2 ) or C(2
C(2

)⊕

) the antiautomorphism τ is translated as the conjugate transpose in matrix algebra.

Proof. If n = 2k is even, consider the isomorphism i2k : Cl2k → C(2k ) and the representation
by left multiplication
k

C(2k ) → EndC (C2 ).
We know6 (pp. 24) that there is in C(2k ) a hermetian product h·, ·i such that
hi2k (v)A, Bi = − hA, i2k (v)Bi ,

∀A, B ∈ C(2k ); v ∈ Rn ⊂ Cln ,

but τ (v) = −v, therefore
hi2k (v)A, Bi = hA, i2k (τ (v))Bi ,

∀A, B ∈ C( 2k ); v ∈ Rn ⊂ Cln .

Thus , i2k (τ (v)) is the adjoint operator i2k (v) with respect to the product h·, ·i. Choosing a
convenient base, without loss of generality we have that i2k (τ (v)) is the conjugate transposed
matrix of i2k (v). Since this is valid for vectors then it is valid for all ϕ ∈ Cln , i.e.
i2k (τ (ϕ)) = (i2k (ϕ))∗ ,

∀ϕ ∈ Cln .

That is, according to isomorphism i2k , the antiautomorphism τ is translated as the conjugate
transpose in matrix algebra.
Note that the same is true if n = 2k + 1 odd, it is sufficient to consider the two nonk

equivalent natural representations C(2k ) ⊕ C(2k ) → EndC (C2 ).
14

Finally we can present the following definition:
Definition 3. We have the following Cln -valued hermitian product
hh·, ·ii : Cln × Cln → Cln
(ξ1 , ξ2 ) 7→ hhξ1 , ξ2 ii = τ (ξ2 )ξ1 .
Remark 1. Note that the following statements are valid:
1. hh·, ·ii is SpinCn -invariant:
hh(g ⊗ s)ξ1, (g ⊗ s)ξ2 ii = ssτ (ξ2 )τ (g)gξ1 = τ (ξ2 )ξ1 = hhξ1 , ξ2 ii , (g ⊗ s) ∈ SpinCn ⊂ Cln ,
since Spinn ⊂ {g ∈ Cln0 ; ḡg = 1} and s ∈ S 1 ⊂ C.
2. The eq. (4) induces the following C-valued map
XC
XC
Q→C
Q×

(ϕ1 , ϕ2 ) = ([P, [ϕ1 ]], [P, [ϕ2 ]]) 7→ hh[ϕ1 ], [ϕ2 ]ii = τ ([ϕ2 ])[ϕ1 ],

where [ϕ1 ], [ϕ2 ] ∈ I n = Cln f are the representatives of ϕ1 , ϕ2 in a given SpinCn -frame

P ∈ Γ PSpinCn .
I n = Cln f is minimal ideal, with f a primitive idempotent.

Note that hh[ϕ1 ], [ϕ2 ]ii = τ ([ϕ2 ])[ϕ1 ] ∈ τ (f)Cl(n+m) f = fCl(n+m) f ≃ C.
Lemma 2. The connection ∇Σ

CQ

is compatible with the product hh·, ·ii

Proof. Fix s = (e1 , ..., en ) : U ⊂ M ⊂ Q → PSO(n+m) a local section of the frame bundle,
l : U ⊂ M ⊂ Q → Ps1 and a local section of the S 1 -principal bundle , w Q : T (PSO(n+m) ) →
so(n + m) the Levi-Civita connection of PSO(n+m) and iA : T PS 1 → iR an arbitrary connection in PS 1 , denote by w Q (ds(X)) = (wij (X)) ∈ so(n + m), iA(dl(X)) = iAl (X).

Then there is the reciprocal question: Given this set of orthonormal spinors

is it possible to construct an isometric immersion of the manifold M in Rn ?
Let M a riemannian p-dimensional manifold, E → M a vector bundle over R with rank
q, assume that T M and E are oriented and SpinC . Denote again by PSO(p) the frame bundle
of T M and by PSO(q) the frame bundle of E. Also the respective SpinC structures are
represented as
Λ1C : PSpinCp → PSO(p) × PS11 ,

Λ2C : PSpinCq → PSO(q) × PS21 .

Define here, as well as in the section III, the S 1 -principal bundle PS 1 such as the bundle
whose transition functions are defined as the product of the transition functions of PS11 and
19

PS21 . It is not difficult to see how that there is a canonical morphism between bundles:
Φ : PS11 ×M PS21 → PS 1 with Φ(p1 · s1 , p2 · s2 ) = Φ(p1 , p2 )s1 s2 , p1 ∈ PS11 , p2 ∈ PS21 , s1 , s2 ∈ S 1 .
Here iA1 : T PS11 → iR, iA2 : T PS21 → iR are arbitrary connections in PS11 and PS21 . Fix
the following local sections s = (e1 , · · · , ep ) : U → PSO(p) , l1 : U → PS11 , l2 : U → PS21 ,
l = Φ(l1 , l2 ) : U → PS 1 . Now iA : T PS 1 → iR is the connection defined by iA(dΦ(l1 , l2 )) =
iA1 (dl1 ) + iA2 (dl2 ).
Here we will fix the following complexed spinor bundles

[ϕ1 ] + · · · + [ϕ2k ] ∈ SpinCn ⊂ I1n ⊕ · · · ⊕ I2nk = Cln .

(4)

Note that this does not depend on the choice of referential s̃, since we are working with
SpinC -principal bundles . Thus in another spinorial frame eq. (4) remains valid.
Then we can define the following C-valued 1-forms :
ξij : T M → fi Cln fj ≃ C
ξij (X) = hhX · ϕi , ϕj ii , i, j = 1, · · · , 2k .

Without loss of generality, since we can make an adequate linear combination of eq. (7),

(8)

Note that this does not depend on the choice of referential s̃, since we are working with
SpinC -principal bundles . Thus in another spinorial frame eq. (8) remains valid.
We can thus define the following C-valued 1-forms :
ξij;λ : T M → fi;λCl(n+m) fj;λ ≃ C
ξij;λ(X) = hhX · ϕi;λ , ϕj;λii , i, j = 1, · · · , 2k , λ = 0, 1.
23

we define the following Cln -valued 1-form

Lemma 7. Suppose each ϕi;0 ∈ Γ ΣC1;0 ≃ Γ ΣCi;0 and ϕi;1 ∈ Γ ΣC1;1 ≃ Γ ΣCi;1 satisfy

eqs. (7) and (8), then ξ defined by eq. (9) is such that
1. ξ is a Rn -valued 1-form.
2. ξ is a closed 1-form, dξ = 0.

Proof. The proof is exactly the same as the lemma 6. Equation (8) implies that ξ is a
Rn -valued form. To show that ξ is a closed form we use that each ϕi;λ satisfy eq. (7).

Thus, regardless of the parity of n, if we assume that the M is simply connected, by the
Poincar‘s lemma follows that there is a function
F : M → Rn ,
such that dF = ξ.
In addition the following lemma is valid
Lemma 8. With the above considerations the following items are valid
1. The map F : M → Rn+m is an isometry.
2. The map
ΦE : E → M × Rn
X ∈ Em 7→ (F (m), ξ(X))
is an isometry between E and the normal bundle of F (M) in Rn , preserving the connection and second fundamental form.

This implies that F is an isometry with its image, and that ΦE is a bundle map
between E and the normal bundle of F (M) in Rn which preserves the metric.

2. Denote by BF and ∇′F the second fundamental form and the normal connection of
immersion F respectively. We would like to show that:

i)ξ(B(X, Y )) = BF (ξ(X), ξ(Y )),

ii)ξ(∇′X η) = ∇′F
ξ(X) ξ(η),

for all X, Y ∈ Γ(T M) and η ∈ Γ(E).
i) First note that:

B F (ξ(X), ξ(Y )) := {∇Fξ(X) ξ(Y )}⊥ = {X(ξ(Y ))}⊥ ,

where the symbol ⊥ means that we are considering the vector component that is

Besides that, dF = ξ where ξ is a Rn -valued 1-form defined by
