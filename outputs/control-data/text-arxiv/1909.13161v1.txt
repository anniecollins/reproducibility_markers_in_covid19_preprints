Abstract. The Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) system is a widely accepted model for simulation of
ionic channels. In this paper, we design, analyze, and numerically validate a second order unconditional positivity-preserving scheme for solving a reduced PNP system, which can well approximate
the three dimensional ion channel problem. Positivity of numerical solutions is proven to hold true
independent of the size of time steps and the choice of the Poisson solver. The scheme is easy to
implement without resorting to any iteration method. Several numerical examples further confirm
the positivity-preserving property, and demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of the
proposed scheme, as well as the fast approach to steady states.

1. Introduction
Biological cells exchange chemicals and electric charge with their environments through ionic
channels in the cell membrane walls. Examples include signaling in the nervous system and coordination of muscle contraction, see [6] for a comprehensive introduction. Mathematically the
flow of ions can be modeled by drift-diffusion equations such as the Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP)
system, see e.g. [5, 7, 8, 12].
In this investigation we design, analyze and numerically validate positivity-preserving algorithms
to solve time-dependent drift-diffusion equations. As a first step, in this paper we focus on a reduced
model derived by Gardner et al [12] as an approximation to the full three dimensional (3D) PNP
system. Let us first recall the full model and its reduction.
1.1. Mathematical models. The general setup in [12] is a flow of positive and negative ions in
water in a channel plus surrounding baths in an electric field against a background of charged
atoms on the channel protein. The distribution of charges is described by continuum particle
densities ci (x, t) for the mobile ions (such as K + , Na+ , Ca++ , · · · ). The flow of ions can be modeled
by the PNP system of m equations
∂t ci = −∇ · Ji ,

i = 1, · · · , m; x ∈ Ω ⊂ R3 , t > 0,

Boltzmann constant and T0 is the absolute temperature [6]. In the Poisson equation,  is the
dielectric coefficient, qi the ionic charge for each ion species i, ρ = ρ(x) the permanent fixed charge
density, and e the proton charge. The coupling parameter zi = qi /e. In general, the physical
parameters , µi and Di are functions of x. Let us mention that the case of no permanent charge
does not pertain to biological channels. Even channels without permanent charge (in the form
of so called acid and base side chains) have large amounts of fixed charge in their (for example)
carbonyl bonds( see, e.g., [17] and references therein).
The derivation of the Nernst-Planck equation typically follows two steps, namely, using the
energy variation to obtain the chemical potential and then using Fick’s laws of diffusion to attain
the Nernst-Planck equation (see e.g. [2]). In the charge dynamics modeled by the traditional
NP equation, mobile ions are treated as volume-less point charges. In order to incorporate more
complex effects such as short-range steric effect and long range Coulomb correlation, modifications
of the PNP equations were derived ( see, e.g., [24] and references therein). Nonetheless, the scheme
methodology proposed in this paper can well be adapted to solve such modified PNP systems.
The 3D geometry of the ion channel can be approximated by a reduced problem along the axial
direction x, with a cross-sectional area A(x) [30, 31]. Subject to a further rescaling as in [13], the
corresponding PNP system (1.1) reduces to the following equations

For ionic channels, an important characteristic is the so-called current-voltage relation, which can
characterize permeation and selectivity properties of ionic channels (see [1] and references therein).

For (1.1), the electric current density (charge flux) is J = m

System (1.2) is a parabolic/elliptic system of partial differential equations, boundary conditions
for both ci and ψ can be Dirichlet or Neumann.
In order to solve the above reduced system, we consider initial data
ci (x, 0) = cin
i (x) ≥ 0,

x ∈ Ω.

1.2. Boundary conditions and model properties. We consider two types of boundary conditions. The first is the Dirichlet boundary condition,
ci (0, t) = ci,l ,

ci (1, t) = ci,r ;

ψ(0, t) = 0, ψ(1, t) = V,

t > 0,

(1.4)

where ci,l , ci,r are non-negative constants, and V is a given constant. This is the setting adopted
in [12]. One important solution property is
ci (x, t) ≥ 0,

x ∈ Ω, t > 0.

(1.5)

Another set of boundary conditions is as follows:
∂x ci + zi ci ∂x ψ = 0,

x = 0, 1,

(−η∂x ψ + ψ)|x=0 = ψ− ,

t > 0,

(η∂x ψ + ψ)|x=1 = ψ+ ,

t > 0,

(1.6)

where ψ− , ψ+ are given constants, the size of parameter η depends on the properties of the surrounding membrane [10]. Here the first one is the zero-flux boundary condition for the transport
equation, and the second is the Robin boundary condition for the Poisson equation. Such boundary condition is adopted in [10] to model the effects of partially removing the potential from the
ends of the channel. For system (1.2) with this boundary condition, solutions have non-negativity,
mass conservation, and free energy dissipation properties, i.e., (1.5),

The positivity-preserving property is of special importance, since negative values in density would
violate the physical meaning of the solution and may destroy the energy dissipation law (1.8). Numerical techniques addressing the positivity preserving property have been introduced in various
application problems, see e.g. [18, 26]. In this paper, we construct second order accurate unconditional positivity-preserving schemes for solving (1.2) subject to two types of boundary conditions.
For the zero-flux boundary condition, the schemes will be shown to satisfy mass conservation and
a discrete energy dissipation law.
1.3. Related works. Numerical methods for solving the PNP system of equations have been
studied extensively; see e.g., [12, 14, 16, 19, 33]. We also refer to [4] for a review on the PNP
model and its generalizations for ion channel charge transport.
For the reduced PNP system (1.2), the finite difference scheme with TR–BDF2 time integration
was first pursued in [12] to simulate an ionic channel. For the one dimensional PNP system, the
second order implicit finite difference scheme proposed in [10] can preserve total concentration of
ions with the aid of a special boundary discretization, but numerical solutions may not be positive
or energy dissipating. An improved scheme, further introduced in [11], can preserve a discrete
form of energy dissipation law up to O(τ 2 + h2 ), where τ is the time step, and h is the spatial
mesh size. In [3] the authors proposed an adaptive conservative finite volume method on a moving
mesh that maintains solution positivity. The second oder finite difference scheme in [22] is explicit
and shown to preserve positivity, mass conservation, and energy dissipation, while the positivitypreserving property is ensured if τ = O(h2 ). Further extension in [23] is a free energy satisfying
discontinuous Galerkin scheme of any high order, where positivity-preserving property is realized
by limiting techniques. The finite element scheme obtained by the method of lines approach in

4

[27] preserves positivity of the solutions and a discrete energy dissipation law. Recently in [15]
the authors presented a fully implicit finite difference method where both positivity and energy
decay are preserved. In their scheme a fixed point iteration is needed for solving the resulting
nonlinear system. These schemes are either explicit or fully implicit in time, the former require a
time step restriction for preserving the desired properties while the later preserve desired properties
unconditionally but they had to be solved by some iterative solvers.
In this paper we design schemes to preserve all three desired properties of solution: positivity,
mass conservation, and energy dissipation, by following [20], in which a second order finite-volume
method was constructed for the class of nonlinear nonlocal equations
∂t c = ∇ · (∇c + c∇(V (x) + W ∗ c)).

(1.10)

The key ingredients include a reformulation of the equation in its non-logarithmic Landau form and
the use of the implicit-explicit time discretization, these together ensure the positivity-preserving
property without any restriction on the size of time steps (unconditional!) and do not require
iterative solvers.
1.4. Contributions and organization of the paper. Our scheme construction is based on the
reformulation
A(x)∂t ci (x, t) = ∂x (A(x)Di e−zi ψ(x,t) ∂x (ci (x, t)ezi ψ(x,t) )),

(1.11)

of the transport equation in (1.2). Similar formulation has been used in [20] and in earlier works
[21, 22]. Following [20], we adopt a semi-implicit time discretization of (1.11):

cn+1
(x) − cni (x)
n
n
i
A(x)
= ∂x A(x)Di e−zi ψ (x) ∂x (cn+1
(x)ezi ψ (x) ) .
i
τ

(1.12)

The feature of such discretization is that it is a linear equation in cn+1
(x), and easy to solve
i
numerically. For spatial discretization, we use the central finite volume approach. The coefficient
matrix of the resulting linear system is an M-matrix and right hand side is a nonnegative vector,
thus positivity of the solution is ensured without any time step restriction.
The main contribution in this paper includes the model reformulation, proofs of unconditional
positivity-preserving properties for two types of boundary conditions, and of mass conservation and
energy dissipation properties for zero flux boundary conditions (1.6). In addition, the positivitypreserving property is shown to be independent of the choice of Poisson solvers. Our implicitexplicit scheme is easy to implement and efficient in computing numerical solutions over long
time.
The paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we derive our numerical scheme for a model
equation. Theoretical analysis of unconditional positivity is provided. In section 3, we formulate
our scheme to the PNP system and prove positivity, mass conservation and energy dissipation
properties of the scheme. Numerical examples are presented in section 4. Finally, concluding
remarks are given in section 5.

2. Numerical methods for a model equation
In this section, we first demonstrate the key ideas through a model problem. Let u(x, t) be an
unknown density, satisfying
A(x)∂t u(x, t) = ∂x (B(x)(∂x u(x, t) − u(x, t)∂x φ(x, t))),
u(x, 0) = uin (x),

x ∈ Ω = [0, 1],

t > 0,
(2.1)

x ∈ Ω,

where A(x) > 0, B(x) > 0 are given functions, and φ(x, t) is either known or can be obtained from
solving another coupled equation. For this model problem, we consider two types of boundary
conditions:
(i) the Dirichlet boundary condition
u(0, t) = ul ,

u(1, t) = ur ,

t > 0,

(2.2)

and (ii) the zero flux boundary condition
∂x u(x, t) − u(x, t)∂x φ(x, t) = 0,

x = 0, 1,

t > 0.

(2.3)

2.1. Scheme formulation. Let N be an integer, and the domain Ω = [0, 1] be partitioned into
computational cells Ij = [xj−1/2 , xj+1/2 ] with cell center xj = xj−1/2 + 21 h, for j ∈ {1, 2, · · · , N },
x1/2 = 0 and xN +1/2 = 1. For simplicity, uniform mesh size h = N1 is adopted. Discretize t
uniformly as tn = τ n, where τ is time step.
From the reformulation
A(x)∂t u(x, t) = ∂x (B(x)eφ(x,t) ∂x (u(x, t)e−φ(x,t) ))

(2.4)

of (2.1), we consider a semi-implicit time discretization as follows:

where un (x) ≈ u(x, tn ), φn (x) ≈ φ(x, tn ). Let unj ≈ h1 Ij un (x)dx, and Aj = h1 Ij A(x)dx, then a

φnj+1/2 =

where φnj is a numerical approximation of φ(xj , tn ).

Before turning to the analysis of solution properties, we comment on these boundary fluxes.
Remark 2.1. The factor 2 in the boundary flux (2.8) suffices to ensure the first order accuracy in
the approximation of
B(x)eφ(x,t) ∂x (u(x, t)e−φ(x,t) )
at the boundary; see [9]. However, the following flux without the factor 2, i.e.

However, it is known that the first order boundary flux does not destroy the second order accuracy
of the scheme, we refer to [32] for a such result regarding the Shortley-Weller method. Hence
throughout the paper, we will not discuss high order boundary fluxes such as (2.11).
2.2. Positivity. It turns out that both schemes, (2.6)-(2.7)-(2.8) and (2.6)-(2.7)-(2.9), preserve
positivity of numerical solutions without any time step restriction.
Theorem 2.1. Scheme (2.6)-(2.7) with either (i) (2.8) and ul ≥ 0, ur ≥ 0, or (ii) (2.9), is positivitypreserving, in the sense that if unj ≥ 0 for all j = 1, · · · , N , then
un+1
≥ 0 for all j = 1, · · · , N.

j
Gk = min {Gj },

it suffices to prove Gk ≥ 0. We discuss in cases: if 1 < k < N, then from the k-th equation of

This implies G1 ≥ 0; so does the case if k = N .

≥ 0 for all j involved.

Remark 2.2. The specific values or choices of {φnj } and {φnj+1/2 } do not affect the unconditional
positivity property of the scheme for {unj }. This result thus can be applied to the case when φ(x, t)
is solved by the Poisson equation, see the next section.

Theorem 2.2, we can conclude ci,j = uj ≥ 0.

Remark 3.2. Though C ∗ is not explicitly given, it is about O(1) as can be seen from a formal limit
∆t → 0. The sufficient condition τ ≤ C ∗ /η suggests that for smaller /η, one should consider a
smaller time step to ensure the scheme stability. This is consistent with our numerical results.
4. Numerical tests
In this section, we implement the fully discrete scheme (3.2)-(3.5) with different boundary conditions. Errors are measured in the following discrete l∞ norm:
ef = max |fj − f¯j |.
1≤j≤N

Here f¯j denotes the average of f on cell Ij . In what follows we take fj = cni,j or ψjn at time t = nτ.

We see from Table 1 and Table 2 that both first and second order boundary fluxes yield second
order convergent solutions. The numerical errors with both fluxes are comparable.
In the remaining numerical tests we only use first order boundary flux (3.6) for the Dirichlet
boundary value problem.
4.2. Effects of permanent charge and channel geometry. The key structure of an ion channel includes both the channel shape and the permanent charge (see e.g. [17]). We present numerical
examples to illustrate the effects from the channel geometry or the permanent change. While we
also examine dependence of the total current (1.3) on voltage V , which is known as the currentvoltage (I-V) relation in [17]. Note that (1.3) can be reformulated as

Robert Eisenberg made clear to us the great importance of the tapered representation of the
baths in one dimensional versions of PNP models of channels, that became clear in his early work
with Wolfgang Nonner [28, 29], followed by many other more formal treatments such as in [12].
In this numerical test, we take h = 0.01, τ = 5 × 10−5 . The solutions are understood to have
reached steady states if ||ψ n − ψ n−1 ||∞ ≤ 10−6 . Table 3 shows times ts needed for reaching each
steady state, number of iterations, and CPU times.

From Table 3 we see that ts = 0.1116 is the longest time needed for reaching the steady state,
so we run the simulation up to t = 0.2.
In Figure 2 we take Q0 = 0.2, rf = 20, varying lc and rc inside the channel, to obtain a series of
snapshots. We see that both c1 and c2 coincide outside the channel, but split inside the channel
with the shape evolving in terms of the channel geometry. The profile of ψ looks similar.

In Figure 3 we fix the channel shape with rf = 20, rc = 1/5, lc = 1/5, varying Q0 , we observe
that the difference between c1 and c2 inside the channel increases in terms of Q0 , roughly we have
c1 − c2 ≈ 2Q0 inside the channel. We can also observe the effects on ψ.
In Figure 4 is the I-V relation for the PNP system with channel shape parameters lc = 1/5,
rc = 1/5, rf = 20, and Q0 = 0.1. We see from the figure that the current is linear in the voltage.
Example 4.3. (No permanent charge in the channel ρ = 0) We still use problem with (4.2), (4.3),
(4.4) and (4.5) to test the effects of the channel geometry, by taking ρ = 0, rf = 20 and varying lc
and rc . In the simulation we take h = 0.01, τ = 5 × 10−5 .

In Figure 5 are snap shots of solutions for different channel geometry. In the case of no permanent
charge, there does not seem to be any layering phenomenon on c1 and c2 : c1 and c2 are rather

close both inside the channel (linear) and inside the bath (constant). The profile for ψ is quite
similar. This is consistent with the analysis in [17], in which the authors showed that the density
in the channel gets steeper as the channel gets narrower. We refer to [25] for a study of steady
state solutions to (4.2) in the case of ρ = 0. They proved that for  > 0 small, there is a unique
nonnegative steady state to problem (4.2) and (4.3).
Example 4.4. (Variable diffusion coefficient and quadratic area function) We consider the system

A(x)∂t c1 = ∂x (A(x)D1 (x)(∂x c1 + 2c1 ∂x ψ),

x ∈ [−10, 10], t > 0

A(x)∂t c2 = ∂x (A(x)D2 (x)(∂x c2 − 3c2 ∂x ψ),

x ∈ [−10, 10], t > 0

A(x)∂t c3 = ∂x (A(x)D3 (x)(∂x c3 + c3 ∂x ψ),
−

x ∈ [−10, 10], t > 0,

where  = 0.1, subject to boundary conditions
ci (±10, t) = 0.5,

ψ(±10, t) = 0,

t > 0.

As in [13], we choose A(x) = 1 + x2 , Di (x) = 20(1 − 0.9e−x ) and ρ = Ce−x . This corresponds to
problem (1.2) with z1 = 2, z2 = −3, z3 = 1, and ci,l = ci,r = 0.5, V = 0. In this numerical test we
take h = 0.1, τ = 10−3 .

We take two different sets of initial data, first set is given as

3 (x) = 0.5 + e

For the second set of initial data we take uniformly distributed random initial data c0i,j ∈ (0, 1).
From Table 5 we see that ts = 2.7410 is the longest time needed for reaching the steady state, so
simulation runs up to t = 3. We vary the parameter C to observe effects of the permanent charge.

In Figure 6 (top three) are snap shots of solutions for initial data (4.8). Varying C, we can see
that max c1 − min c2 (or max c3 − min c2 ) increases in terms of C.
In Figure 6 (bottom three) are snap shots of solutions for random initial data, we see that the
choice of initial data does not affect the steady state densities.
4.3. Mass conservation and free energy dissipation. In this numerical test we demonstrate
mass conservation and free energy dissipation properties.
Example 4.5. (Zero flux + Robin boundary conditions) In this example we consider (4.6) with
initial condition (4.8) and boundary condition
∂x ci + zi ci ∂x ψ = 0,

x = −10, 10,

(−η∂x ψ + ψ)|x=−10 = −0.1,

t > 0,

(η∂x ψ + ψ)|x=10 = 0.1,

t > 0.

(4.9)

We choose same A(x), Di (x), ρ(x) and zi as in Example 4.4 and choose η = 0.1,  = 0.1. In this
numerical test we use scheme (3.2)-(3.5) and (3.7), with h = 0.1, τ = 10−3 .
In Figure 7 (left) are snap shots of solutions for initial data (4.8), (right) is free energy for the
system and total mass for each species, which confirms energy dissipation and mass conservation
properties as proved in Theorem 3.2.
5. Concluding Remarks
In this paper, we have developed an unconditional positivity-preserving finite-volume method
for solving initial boundary value problems for the reduced Poisson-Nernst-Planck system. Such a
reduced system has been used as a good approximation to the 3D ion channel problem. By writing
the underling system in non-logarithmic Landau form and using a semi-implicit time discretization,
we constructed a simple, easy-to-implement numerical scheme which proved to satisfy positivity
independent of time steps and the choice of Poisson solvers. Our scheme also preserves total
mass and satisfies a free energy dissipation property for zero flux boundary conditions. Extensive
numerical tests have been presented to simulate ionic channels in different settings.
