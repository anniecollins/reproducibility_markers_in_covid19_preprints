We show that weakly incoherent optical beams propagating in a Kerr medium exhibit a universal
algebraic coherence after a short propagation time, mimicking the quasi-long-range order of ultracold
quantum Bose gases in two dimensions. If two plates are inserted in the medium, this optical quasicondensate gives rise to a long-range Casimir-like force, attractive at large distances and repulsive
at short distances.

INTRODUCTION

In its original version, the Casimir force stems from
the confinement of the quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field: two objects placed in vacuum modify
the electromagnetic ground-state energy, which in turn
induces an attractive interaction between them [1, 2].
Beyond this traditional scenario, it was quickly realized
that fluctuation-driven forces may arise whenever objects
are immersed in a fluctuating environment, which may or
may not be made of photons [3–5]. Such forces were investigated, e.g., in the vicinity of a critical point in binary
liquid mixtures [6–9] (critical Casimir effect). In the context of quantum gases, fluctuation-driven forces were also
considered for impurities embedded in interacting quantum gases of massive particles [10–18]. This problem
is especially interesting in low dimensions, where interacting Bose gases spontaneously form quasi-condensates,
whose quantum fluctuations exhibit long-range correlations [19–22]. Since, in a Casimir-like scenario, the range
of these correlations controls the range of the force, quasicondensates constitute excellent candidates for the generation of a sizeable interaction between objects. In this
context, special attention was paid to one-dimensional
Bose gases at equilibrium [17, 18], where algebraic correlations give rise to long-range Casimir-like forces.
While the notion of condensation seems, at first sight,
restricted to massive ultracold gases, many theoretical
and experimental efforts have been recently undertaken
to describe and observe Bose condensation of light. After
seminal observations in polariton systems [23, 24], roomtemperature condensates of light were achieved in dyefilled optical microcavities where the confined photons
acquire an effective mass and thermalize via their interactions with the dye molecules [25]. Another strategy to
thermalize massive photons consists in letting an optical
beam propagate in a cavityless, nonlinear Kerr medium.
In the paraxial approximation, the propagation is governed by a nonlinear Schrödinger equation where the optical axis plays the role of time and the nonlinearity the
role of photon interactions [26, 27]. The beam thus behaves as a fluid of light [28], which may thermalize at

Kerr medium

FIG. 1: Upon propagating in a three-dimensional Kerr material, an optical beam with initially small spatial fluctuations
develops a transverse algebraic coherence that induces a longrange Casimir-like pressure between two nearby objects embedded in the medium (here two plates). We describe this
pressure within a scattering approach where fluctuations are
unitarily reflected by and transmitted through the plates.

long enough propagation time [29–31]. Another fundamental interest of this setup lies in its two-dimensional
nature. This implies that, if condensation cannot exist
without cavity, quasi-condensation is on the other hand
possible. To our knowledge however, quasi-condensates
of light have not yet been considered nor observed experimentally. Regarding the interaction between fluids
of light and matter, the drag forces experienced by an
obstacle have been investigated theoretically [32], and a
recent experiment showed evidence for the suppression of
such forces in a photorefractive material [33]. This phenomenon was interpreted as the onset of superfluidity, a
concept validated via measurements of the Bogoliubov
dispersion of photons in atomic vapors [34, 35]. Casimirlike forces in Kerr media, have, on the other hand, little
been addressed so far.
In this article, we theoretically show that weakly incoherent optical beams propagating in a Kerr medium
over a short distance exhibit a universal, algebraic coherence, mimicking ultracold Bose quasi-condensates in two
dimensions. If two objects are immersed in the medium,
this long-range coherence leads to an enhanced, longrange Casimir-like force between them. Our analysis is
based on a natural extension of an experimental setup
recently used to measure drag forces on dielectric obstacles [33], and illustrated in Fig. 1. A monochromatic
light beam carrying weak transverse spatial fluctuations

is let propagate in a Kerr medium in which two plates,
parallel to the optical axis z, are embedded. Due to the
photon interactions pertained to the nonlinear medium,
the initial small fluctuations get amplified and, after a
short propagation distance, the beam reaches a quasistationary prethermal state [36–40]. For low enough initial fluctuations, we find that this state exhibits longrange correlations in the transverse plane (x, y), triggering an unconventional Casimir-like pressure which decays
algebraically with the plate separation L.

QUASI-CONDENSATE OF LIGHT

Before addressing the complete problem in Fig. 1,
let us forget the plates for a moment and consider a
monochromatic, plane-wave optical beam impinging on
a homogeneous, semi-infinite Kerr material at z = 0. We
write the electric field at any point (r ⊥ , z) ≡ (x, y, z)
as E(r, z, t) = R[Ψ(r ⊥ , z)eik0 z−iωt ]ey , where ω is the
carrier frequency, k0 = ω/c, and ey is a unit polarization vector along the y axis. In the paraxial approximation, the complex field envelope Ψ(r, z) obeys the twodimensional nonlinear Schrödinger equation [26, 27]

where g controls the strength of the Kerr nonlinearity,
assumed to be defocusing, g > 0. Suppose now that the
incident beam is prepared as a superposition of a uniform background of intensity I0 and a spatially
fluctuat√
ing speckle field φ(r ⊥ ), Ψ(r ⊥ , z = 0) = I0 +  φ(r ⊥ ).
We describe the latter as a complex, Gaussian random
function of two-point correlation hφ(r ⊥ )φ∗ (r ⊥ + ∆r)i =
I0 γ(∆r), where the brackets refer to statistical averaging.
For definiteness, in the following we consider a Gaussian
correlation, γ(∆r) ≡ exp(−∆r 2 /4σ 2 ), with correlation
length σ [41]. Our main results are, however, independent of this specific choice. From now on, we also mainly
focus on the limit   1 of a weakly incoherent field.
This, indeed, corresponds to the most interesting configuration where the incident beam mimics a noninteracting, low-temperature Bose gas undergoing an interaction
quench upon entering the nonlinear medium.
The coherence properties of the beam in the material are encoded in the coherence function g1 (∆r, z) ≡
hΨ(r ⊥ , z)Ψ∗ (r ⊥ + ∆r, z)i [41]. We have first calculated
g1 by numerically propagating the initial state Ψ(r ⊥ , z =
0) with Eq. (1) using a split-step method. For the simulations we choose a nonlinearity
such that the ratio ξ/σ
√
of the healing length ξ ≡ 1/ 4gI0 k0 to the speckle correlation length is small, a condition required for the nonlinearity to have a significant impact on the beam evolution.
The results are shown in Fig. 2 against ∆r/σ (dots) for
increasing values of z/zNL , where zNL ≡ 1/2gI0 is the
nonlinear length. At z = 0 (upper black
dots), the

 coherence function g1 (∆r, z = 0) = I0 1 + 2 γ(∆r) describes the initial superposition of the plane wave and

small speckle component (solid black curve). This structure changes dramatically when z 6= 0. After a fast,
transient evolution over a few tens of zNL , the overall coherence drops but the short-range component I0 2 γ(∆r)
is converted into a long-range, algebraic correlation, as
shown in the inset Fig. 2. Once this regime has been
reached, g1 also varies rather weakly with z over a spatial
rangep
set by the Lieb-Robinson bound ∆r = 2cs z, where
cs ≡ gI0 /k0 is the speed of sound. This phenomenon,
known as prethermalization, describes a quasi-stationary
regime where the beam behaves as a quasi-thermalized,
weakly interacting fluid [36–40]. Since   1, the effective temperature of this state is typically low and the
fluid is similar to a quasi-condensate, mimicking the wellknown quasi-long-range order of ultracold quantum Bose
gases in two dimensions [19–22]. Out of the “light cone”,
i.e. for ∆r > 2cs z, long-range correlations have not yet
the time to establish and g1 reaches a plateau reminiscent
of the coherent component of the initial beam.
Theoretically, this behavior is well captured by a timedependent Bogoliubov description. This approach has
been previously used to describe the out-of-equilibrium
dynamics of quenched, weakly interacting quantum gases
[42, 43]. Here we adapt it to a classical light beam evolving from the initial state Ψ(r ⊥ , z = 0) onwards. Since the
beam propagates in an effective two-dimensional space –
z playing the role of a propagation time, see Eq. (1) –, its
phase fluctuations are large. This requires to make use of
a density-phase formalism [22], as detailed in Appendix
A. The result for g1 is:

with an exponent α = 2 σ 2 /2ξ 2 . The algebraic law (3) is
shown in the inset of Fig. 2 (dashed curve). It signals the
formation of a quasi-condensate of light. Eq. (3) holds up
to the light-cone bound ∆r = 2cs z. Out of the light cone,
the coherence function saturates at g1 ∼ I(σ/cs z)α . We
stress that the emergence of long-range coherence discussed here does not rely on non-local effects [45]. It
spontaneously emerges even with local interactions, provided one starts from a weakly incoherent beam.

III.

CASIMIR-LIKE FORCE

The long-range coherence exhibited by optical beams
in the prethermal regime makes the configuration of Fig.
1 promising for realizing a sizeable Casimir-like force. To
confirm this intuition, we now add the plates and explore
the fluctuations-induced interaction between them. To
calculate this interaction, we make use of a scattering approach to Casimir forces, in which the effect of the plates
is described in terms of the transmission and reflection
of field fluctuations in the absence of coupling, assuming
unitarity only [46] (in the configuration of Fig. 1, the
uniform mean-field component hΨ(z)i does not yield any
force). The first step of this approach consists in decomposing the field fluctuations in the three regions delineated by the plates into components moving forward and
backward along the x axis, as shown in Fig. 1. In the two
outer regions, we express
the incoming field fluctuations

Note

 that, at z = 0, Eq. (2)
well reduces to I0 1 + 2 γ(∆r) since   1. While the
Bogoliubov approach is generally valid at small z, as z
increases interactions between quasiparticles become relevant and should be accounted for [44]. In the prethermal regime we are interested in however, their effect at
∆r  σ is very well captured by a simple renormalization
of I, as explained in Appendix B. Using this procedure,
the agreement between Eq. (2) and the numerical data
is excellent over two orders of magnitude of z/zNL , as
seen in Fig. 2. The algebraic decay of g1 , visible when
z  zNL , is a consequence of the large phase fluctuations
of the beam in the nonlinear medium, stemming from
the infrared divergence 1/k 2 (q) ∼ q −2 in Eq. (2). They
yield the asymptotic law:

FIG. 3: Casimir pressure, Eq. (6), as a function of the plate

with the long-range coherence of the prethermal fluid of light,

expression of S and R is given in Appendix C. With
the fields in the three regions expressed in terms of the
components of S and R, we then evaluate the average
radiation pressures on each side of a given plate, the difference of which defining the Casimir pressure. The radiation pressure is given by the diagonal component Txx
of the stress tensor of the fluid of light [47]. Within the
Bogoliubov approximation and using the unitary transformation Ψ → Ψ exp(igI0 z), we find for instance (see
Appendix C) that the energy flux associated with the
incoming field δΨ+

where r(q) denotes the reflection coefficient of a single plate in the direction q, and L is the plate separation. The Casimir pressure thus naturally appears as the
noise (density plus current) spectrum of the fluid of light,
weighted by the admittance of the cavity, summed over
all possible scattering directions q. Eq. (5) can be further
simplified by noting that, in the paraxial approximation,
the fluctuations are essentially scattered at grazing incidence. It follows that r2 (q) ' 1 whatever the nature of

where the sum runs over all resonance spatial frequencies
of the cavity. In this relation, the first term in the righthand side involves the coherence function (2). This term
dominates at large separation L  σ, where the phase
fluctuations of the beam make g1 long-range. We show
in Appendix D that the current correlator g1j (∆r, z) ≡
2=hδΨ∗ (r ⊥ , z)∂z δΨ(r ⊥ + ∆r, z)i/k0 , on the other hand,
is essentially governed by the intensity fluctuations of
the beam, which are typically small when   1. Its
contribution is thus important at short scale L . σ only.
The Casimir pressure (6), calculated with the Bogoliubov theory, is shown in Fig. 3 as a function of the plate
separation L, in the prethermal regime z  zNL where
it is essentially independent of z. Its most remarkable
feature is the behavior at large separation. The latter is
governed by the first term in the right-hand side of Eq.

Eq. (7) is a central result of the article. It shows that at
large separation the pressure is attractive and decays algebraically. The asymptotic law (7) is compared with the
exact formula (6) in the inset of Fig. 3. The algebraic decay is governed by the exponent α = 2 σ 2 /2ξ 2 , which can
be either larger or smaller than 1 since both   1 and
ξ/σ  1. In particular, when α > 1, the pressure is much
larger than the pressure P ∼ −0 I0 /(k0 σ)2 γ 00 (2L) that
would result from the use of a fully developed speckle,
i.e. Ψ(r ⊥ , z) = φ(r ⊥ ). Furthermore, the decay (7) is
universal, in the sense that it only depends on the small
set of parameters (ξ, σ, ), but not on the specific shape
of γ(∆r). At small separation L . σ, the pressure (6)

becomes governed by the current correlator and turns
repulsive, as seen in Fig. 3. Its L dependence at such
short scale is nonuniversal in general, i.e. it depends
on the shape of γ(∆r) (see Appendix D). Fig. 3 and
Eq. (7) also reveal that the overall magnitude of the
pressure increases with decreasing ξ/σ. This result can
be understood as follows. When ξ  σ, the speckle
spectrum selects only the low (phonon-like) Bogoliubov
modes |q|ξ  1, responsible for the algebraic decay of the
coherence function and a sizable Casimir force. In contrast, when ξ/σ & 1 the speckle spectrum also captures
particle-like modes |q|ξ & 1. Since these modes describe
purely non-interacting particles, their coherence function
hardly evolves from its form at z = 0, which carries small
fluctuations and therefore leads to a small force.
We finally comment on the role of the parameter ,
which controls the amount of fluctuations in the incident beam. At small , the effective temperature of the
prethermal regime is small, so that the fluid of light effectively behaves as a low-temperature interacting Bose
gas in two dimensions, i.e., a quasi-condensate. By analogy, a larger  will describe a gas of temperature typically
above the quasi-condensation threshold, i.e., of exponentially small coherence [48]. This qualitative picture is
confirmed by numerical simulations of g1 shown in Fig.
4. As  increases, the algebraic behavior of g1 turns to an
exponential decay, making the pressure (6) much weaker.
In other words, and perhaps counterintuitively, as far as
the Casimir pressure is concerned it is much more interesting to inject small fluctuations and let the Kerr
medium amplify them than using strong fluctuations for
the start.

CONCLUSION

Let us conclude with experimental considerations. In
atomic vapors illuminated slightly away from resonance,

5
nonlinearities such that zNL ' 1 mm and ξ ' 10 µm can
be reached [31]. For a cell length z = 7 cm, this corresponds to z/zNL ' 70 and 2cs z ' 1.4 mm for the LiebRobinson bound, much larger than the speckle correlation σ, usually on the order of a few tens of microns. A
large window 2cs z/σ of two or three orders of magnitude
can thus be realized, making the long-range behavior of
g1 observable under rather reasonable conditions. Measuring the Casimir force is more difficult as it requires to
distinguish it from stray forces unrelated to fluctuations.
One example are the field perturbations induced by the
plate edges at z = 0, which may create an additional
deterministic force. This contribution could, however,
be removed by prior measurement of the force created
by the non-fluctuating background, or reduced by using
smooth plate profiles near the interface.

Ψ(r ⊥ , z) = I + δI(r ⊥ , z) exp[−igI0 z + iθ(r ⊥ , z)], insert this Ansatz into Eq. (1) and linearize with respect

∂z θ(r ⊥ , z) = ∇ δI(r ⊥ , z)/4k0 I0 − gδI(r ⊥ , z).

also that when writing Eqs. (A1) and (A2) we did
not linearize with respect to the phase θ, whose fluctuations are typically large in low-dimensional interacting systems [22]. To find δI and θ, we diagonalize Eqs.
(A1) and (A2) inRFourier space, using the Fourier transform δI(q, z) ≡ d2 rδI(r ⊥ , z)e−iq·r⊥ and similarly for

While Eq. (2) faithfully models the coherence function
at small z, higher-order nonlinear contributions arise as
the beam propagates deeper in the Kerr medium. Physically, these corrections describe interactions between the
Bogoliubov quasiparticles and become increasingly important as z/zNL increases. Eventually, they entail the
full thermalization of the fluid of light [44]. While their
complete description at any zNL is a formidable task,
in the present work we are interested in the prethermal
regime where quasiparticle interactions only bring small
corrections to Eq. (2). We model them by adding a
phenomenological parameter β according to

In this prescription, which preserves normalization, the

the exponential can be interpreted as the zeroth-, firstand second-order contributions of a perturbation expansion of ln g1 /I. Guided by the universality of the algebraic decay of g1 in the prethermal regime, captured by
the Bogoliubov contribution, we assume β to depend on
z only. This turns out to be an excellent approximation,
as seen in Fig. 2 where the solid curves are obtained by
fitting Eq. (B1) to the numerical data, with β(z) as the

6
only fit parameter. In practice, we find that the prescription (B1) typically works up to z/zNL ∼ 1000. At larger
z, the system starts deviating much from the prethermal
regime and a more general kinetic theory is needed [44].
Appendix C: Derivation of the Casimir pressure

The coefficients Rij and Sij of the resonance and scattering matrices of the cavity depend on the reflection
and transmission coefficients of a single plate, r and t,
which obey the unitarity conditions |r|2 + |t|2 = 1 and
rt∗ + tr∗ = 0 (to lighten the notations we omit the q
dependence of r and t) [46]:

We are now in position to compute the radiation pressures exerted by the various fluctuation components on
the plates. To achieve this goal, we make use of the stress
tensor of the fluid of light [47]:

Note that when g → 0 Eq. (C9) coincides with the paraxial limit of the usual time-averaged Maxwell stress tensor
of electromagnetic waves in free space [49]. To implement
Eq. (C9) within a linear scattering theory, it is first required to quadratize Txx . In the density-phase formulation, this can be achieved by noting that, for small intensity fluctuations, |Ψ|4 ' 2I|Ψ|2 − I 2 . Inserting then Eq.
(C1) into the quadratized version of (C9) and averaging
over the statistics of the speckle, we find, after redefining
Ψ → Ψ exp(igI0 z):

Appendix D: Current fluctuation spectrum

In addition to the coherence function g1 , the
Casimir pressure (6) also involves the current correlator
g1j (∆r, z) ≡ 2=hδΨ∗ (r ⊥ , z)∂z δΨ(r ⊥ + ∆r, z)i/k0 , where
δΨ(r ⊥ , z) ≡ Ψ(r ⊥ , z) − hΨ(r ⊥ , z)i. To calculate it, we
proceed as for g1 : we linearize with respect to intensity
fluctuations and use the Gaussian statistics of φr and φi .
This leads to

The intensity-phase correlators, finally, are evaluated
from Eqs. (A5) and (A6). The final expression of g1j
is:
g1j (∆r, z) =g1 (∆r, z)[F (∆r) + G(z)]

The function F (∆r) is short range, with a decay ranging
over a few σ and entirely controlled by the shape of the
power spectrum γ(q). The correlator g1j (∆r, z) is thus
short range as well – see Eq. (D3) – and nonuniversal.
