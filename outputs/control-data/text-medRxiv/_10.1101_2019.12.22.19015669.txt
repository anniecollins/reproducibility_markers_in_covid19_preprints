ABSTRACT:
BACKGROUND: Metabolic reprogramming in breast cancer is depicted as a crucial change in
the tumor microenvironment. Besides the molecular understanding of metabolic heterogeneity,
appreciable attentions are drawn to characterize metabolite profiles in tumor tissue and derived
biological fluids and tissue materials. Several findings reported on the metabolic alterations of
free aromatic amino acids (FAAAs) and other metabolites in biological fluids. Furthermore,
there is a significant gap in the development of a suitable method for the purification and
analysis of metabolite biomarkers in nails of cancer patients.
METHODS: To address the metabolite alterations specifically FAAAs level in nails, fingernail
clippings of breast cancer patients (N=10), and healthy subjects (N-12) were used for extraction
and purification of metabolites. Here, we report a novel and specifically designed vertical tube
gel electrophoresis (VTGE) system that helped for the purification of metabolites in the range of
(100-1000 Da) from nail materials. The claimed VTGE system uses 15% polyacrylamide under
non-denaturing and non-reducing conditions that makes eluted metabolites directly compatible
with LC-HRMS and other analytical techniques. Qualitative and quantitative determination of
FAAAs in nail lysates were done by positive ESI mode of Agilent LC-HRMS platform.
RESULTS:
The analysis on collected data of nail metabolites clearly suggests that FAAAs including
tryptophan, tyrosine, phenylalanine and histidine are undetectable in nail lysates of breast cancer
over healthy subjects. This is a first report that shows the highly reduced levels of FAAAs in
nails of breast cancer. Furthermore, present observation is in consonance with previous findings
that support that breast cancer patients show cancer cachexia, high amino acid catabolism that
drive metabolite driven cancer growth and proliferation.
CONCLUSION: This paper provides a proof of concept for a novel and specifically developed
VTGE process that assisted to show the first evidence on undetectable level of FAAAs in nails of
breast cancer patients as metabolite biomarkers. Here, the authors propose the potential use of
VTGE assisted process to achieve metabolomic discovery in nails of breast cancer and other
tumor types.

INTRODUCTION
At global level, it is estimated that frequency of breast cancer among women is around
1.5 million each year. In the current decade, around 570,000 women died from breast cancer that
is approximately 15% of all cancer deaths among women (1-2). Besides the need of better
efficacious drug options with precision-guided therapy, a need for the early diagnosis and
monitoring of cancer drug treatment is at the forefront at preclinical and clinical levels (3-4). To
achieve the above goal, search for new classes of biomarkers at the levels of genome,
transcriptome, small RNAs, proteome, and metabolome is highly relevant in a global context and
Indian setting (5-6).
Intra- and inter-tumor heterogeneity at both cellular and non-cellular levels are depicted
as the basis of origin, progression and drug response in breast cancer (7-10). The elucidation of
metabolic heterogeneity at tumor microenvironment and macroenvironment level is important in
the perspective of biomarkers development and future interventions in breast cancer (11-16).
Among metabolic heterogeneity, amino acid catabolism that targets Free Aromatic Amino Acids
(FAAAs) such as tryptophan, tyrosine, phenylalanine and histidine are regarded as one of the
preferable hallmarks in breast cancer that support their growth and progression (17-22).
The determination of metabolite profiling is perceived as one viable option to detect early
and late stage physiological and pathological changes in cancer patients (23-29). In this
direction, several attempts are noticed by using metabolomic approaches, including LC-HRMS,
GC-MS and NMR spectroscopy. These metabolomics approaches were focused on the tumor
tissue and biological fluids, including serum, urine and saliva (30-36). However, literature
completely lacks on the suitable methods that targets to profile nail metabolites of breast cancer
and other tumor types.

In this paper, we claim a novel and specifically designed vertical tube gel electrophoresis
(VTGE) based metabolite identifications of metabolites in nail lysates. Further, data report that
undetectable levels of FAAAs in nail lysate of breast cancer patients may serve as potential
diagnostic biomarkers.
Methods
Study Population
For this pilot study, breast cancer patients (N=10) and healthy women subjects (N=12)
were recruited at Dr. D. Y. Patil Medical College, Pune, India. In accordance with the
Institutional Ethics Committee (IEC), a formal approval was obtained to conduct research on
healthy clinical subjects and breast cancer patients. All the participating clinical subjects were
apprised about the aims of study and informed consent was collected.
In the present study, metabolite profiling data were analyzed between breast cancer
patients and healthy subjects, without characterizing the molecular sub-types and prior
chemotherapy. The primary goals were to develop a protocol for the preparation of the nail
metabolite lysate, followed by purification process of nail metabolites and then finally
characterizing with the help of the LC-HRMS. At this stage of study, we focused on the novel
methods and processes that helped to collect metabolite profiles in the nail lysates of breast
cancer and healthy subjects. In future, the claimed methods and processes that use VTGE and
LC-HRMS technique may be used for large study population of breast cancer patients with
attributes of molecular sub-types and history of treatments.
Preparation of nail lysates
Fingernail clippings were collected in a microfuge tube and cleaned to remove debris,
environmental contaminations by using a mild detergent and 70% ethyl alcohol. Further,

fingernail clippings were dried, weighed and coded properly for healthy and breast cancer
patients. Next, equal amount of fingernail clippings (20 mg) was added to 800 µl of extraction
buffer (Tris-HCl (20mM, PH- 8.5), 2.6M Thiourea, 5M Urea, Beta-Mercaptoethanol) for lysis of
fingernail clippings. Next, sample mixture was incubated for 24 hr at 50 C under dark
condition. Further, sample mixture was centrifuged at 15,000 X RPM for 30 min. The
supernatant was collected in a fresh microfuge tube and filtered as by using 0.45 micron syringe
filter membrane. The above prepared nail lysates of healthy and breast cancer patients were
diluted three times, stored and labelled properly for purification by using VTGE system.
Purification of metabolites by using VTGE system
In order to purify metabolites of nail materials, we employed a novel and specifically
designed VTGE system that is standardized to use 15% polyacrylamide gel matrix to remove
major components as proteins, polysaccharides, large lipid molecules and other various
debris/contaminants. At the same time, claimed VTGE system allowed for purification of
metabolites in the range of 100 Da to 1000 Da (37).
Above prepared sterile and filtered nail lysate (750 µl) was mixed with (250 µl) the
loading buffer (4X Glycerol and Tris pH-6.8) and electrophoresed on VTGE casted with 15%
acrylamide gel (acrylamide: bisacrylamide, 30:1) as a matrix. The fractionated elute was
collected in electrophoresis running buffer that contains water and glycine and excludes
traditional SDS, and other reducing agents. A notable distinctiveness of VTGE system claims
that running buffer (3 ml) and elution buffer (3 ml) are identical as (Water-Glycine (192 mM),
pH: 8.3). A flow diagram of VTGE method is presented in Figure 1A and 1B that show the
assembly and design of VTGE system. Nail lysate metabolites from healthy and breast cancer
patients were eluted in the same running buffer, which is referred as “Elution buffer” and placed

in the lower electrophoretic tube that has anode wire. After loading of nail lysate (750 µl) along
with loading buffer (4X, 250 µl), voltage and current ratio from power supply was maintained to
generate 1500-2500 mW of power to achieve the electrophoresis of biological samples. The total
run time was allowed for 2 hr. At the end of 2 hr, lower 3 ml collecting buffer was collected in a
fresh microfuge tube for direct LC-HRMS characterization. Interestingly, pH of eluted
metabolite buffer was measured for healthy and breast cancer patients that ranged between 3.03.5 acidic pH. An acidic pH (2.5-4.0) buffer containing metabolites are known to help in
ionization efficiency during LC-HRMS analysis (38). At the end of the run, inner tube containing
polyacrylamide gel was removed and placed for coomassie brilliant blue dye staining to ensure
that protein components of nail lysates were trapped in the polyacrylamide matrix. Eluted nail
metabolites from healthy and breast cancer patients were stored at -20oC for direct identification
by LC-HRMS technique.
Identification of potential nail metabolites by LC-HRMS
The qualitative and quantitative analysis of nail metabolites carried out by LC-HRMS.
The purified nail metabolites from VTGE system was submitted to LC-HRMS. For liquid
chromatography (LC) component, RPC18 column was used as Zorbax, 2.1 X 50 mm, 1.8 micron
meters. Further, a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min and a gradient was formed by mixing mobile phase A
(water containing 5mM ammonium acetate) and B (0.2% formic acid). For the run of sample, an
injection volume was of 25 µl and a flow rate of solvent was maintained at 0.3 ml per minute.
The HPLC column effluent was allowed to move onto an Electrospray Ionization Triple
Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer (Agilent Technologies). For mass identification of nail
metabolites, samples were run in positive electrospray ionization (ESI) M-H mode. During LCHRMS analysis, mass spectrometer component was used as MS Q-TOF Quadrupole time-of-

flight mass spectrometry (Q-TOF-MS) (Agilent Technologies, 6500 Series Q-TOF LC/MS
System) with dual AJS electrospray ionization (ESI) mode. The acquisition mode of MS1 was
recorded with a minimum value of m/z at 60 and maximum value of m/z at 1700.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Data are presented as the mean ± SD. The statistical significance between the healthy
subjects and breast cancer patients were assessed with the help of one-way ANOVA test. Data
calculation and statistical tests were performed by SPSS version 15.0 (SPSS) software package.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The importance of metabolite adaptations and profiling of metabolites in fine-needle
aspiration biopsies, surgical biopsies, serum, urine and saliva was shown in various tumor types
including breast, liver, thyroid and colorectal cancer (31-36). However, it is important to note
that metabolite profiling in nail materials of cancer patients, including breast cancer has not been
reported in literature. Besides non-availability of nail metabolite profiling in cancer patients,
even a suitable method and processes to profile metabolites from a nail lysate of other human
disease is completely lacking.
Novelty of VTGE process
In literature, limited attempts are available that delineate the nail metabolite profiling in
an environmental exposure cases and disease conditions (39-44). Interestingly, a metabolomic
study of cancer metabolite profiles in nail lysate has not been investigated previously in the
literature. To achieve a new and additional knowledge on metabolomic biomarkers in breast
cancer, this paper claims a novel and specifically designed VTGE system and involved methods
to purify nail lysate metabolites. The lysates are directly compatible with LC-HRMS techniques
without any further need of complicated extraction, modifications and labelling protocols to

identify and estimate metabolite biomarkers. Among a pool of various metabolites, FAAAs are
considered as key tumor metabolite that supports growth and progression (17-22, 30). Based on
the literature, there is not a single paper that addresses the importance of FAAAs as potential
biomarkers in nail materials of breast cancer patients. To address the need of non-invasive,
cheaper and rapid methods for the metabolite biomarkers in breast cancer, the authors present a
novel and specifically designed VTGE based purification of metabolites (100-1000 Da) of nail
materials of breast cancer patients. The claimed VTGE method is simply the out-of-box
innovative applications with respect to classical Laemmli (1970)45 system that is primarily used
for the separation and purification of large macromolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids. In
this novel method, the authors have designed a VTGE system with the help of laboratory plastic
ware that purifies nail metabolites (100 Da-1000 Da) by direct elution in the lower running
buffer.
Nails accumulate metabolites
Recently, metabolomic studies in various biological fluids, including serum, urine, saliva
and tissues are reported to highlight the importance of metabolite as biomarkers (15, 16; 23-29).
However, use of nails as a source of metabolite biomarkers in cancer and other human disease
conditions are highly limited. On the other hand, use of nail metabolite profiling is reported to
some extent in case of toxicology and environmental exposure. Limited reports support the
avenues to explore nail metabolites, including ethyl glucuronide in the keratinous matrices of
nail materials of patients (40-44). It is worth to mention that glucuronide derivatives as a
hallmarks of liver metabolism upon drugs. Therefore, presence of ibuprofen glucuronide in nails
of healthy and breast cancer patients is supported by the previous reports on detection of ethyl
glucuronide in the keratinous matrices of nails. In other way, claimed VTGE system assisted nail

metabolite profiling approach is convincing and in line with existing, but highly limited reports.
Furthermore, acid digestion and SPE clean-up of metabolite derived from alternative plasticizers
and flame retardants such as bis(2-propylheptyl) phthalate (DPHP), bis(2-ethylhexyl)
terephthalate (DEHTP), bis(2-ethylhexyl) adipate (DEHA)), and one FR (2,2-bis (chloromethyl)propane-1,3-diyltetrakis(2-chloroethyl) bisphosphate (V6) in nail materials of selected
participants (40,42). A nail metabolite profiling study reported the use of ball mill grounding and
extraction process followed by UHPLC-triple quadrupole-mass analyzer (41).
In the light of negligible approaches to profile nail metabolites in breast cancer and other
disease conditions, we claim that VTGE system assisted purification process is novel and highly
efficient with LC-HRMS technique compared to scarce metabolite identification approaches
from nails. Another curious fact is important to be discussed that the use of nails as a source of
metabolite biomarkers in breast cancer patients and other pathological conditions may have an
added advantage over other biological fluids such as serum, saliva and urine in terms of less
microbial and environmental contaminations. The data clearly show that identified nail
metabolites, including FAAAs and drug metabolites are detected in positive ESI total ion
chromatogram of healthy subjects (Figure 2A) that show Tryptophan (RT-1.523), LPhenylalanine (RT-5.76), L-Tyrosine (RT-2.198), Histidine (RT-0.624). On the other hand,

of

metabolites namely 6a,3'-p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel

(RT-8.493) and

of anti-inflammatory drug ibuprofen is detected in both healthy subjects and breast cancer
patients that clearly convince the precision and efficacy to show the proof-of-concept of VTGE
assisted nail metabolites purification and identifications by LC-HRMS. Finally, positive ESI

chromatogram reveals undetectable FAAAs metabolites in nails of breast cancer patients
compared to highly abundant in the case of healthy subjects.
Identifications of drug metabolites in nail
Furthermore, we looked into the LC-HRMS identified metabolites other than FAAAs and
the data suggest that various kinds of drugs including anti-inflammatory, anti-analgesic,
antibiotics and anti-cancer drugs are actually accumulated in the nails of selected clinical
subjects. Some of notable anticancer drug metabolites such as 6a, 3'-p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel and
doxorubicinol are exclusively highly abundant in nail lysates of most of selected cancer patients.
A positive ESI extracted ionization chromatogram (EIC) is presented as 6a, 3'-pDihydroxypaclitaxel (+ESI EIC 871.2682, 872.2716, 889.2788, 890.2821) and doxorubicinol
(+ESI EIC 527.1786, 528.1819, 545.1892, 546.1925) in Figure 3B and Figure 3C, respectively.
Furthermore, a positive ESI EIC of ibuprofen glucuronide (+ESI EIC 364.1517, 382.1622), a
well-known anti-inflammatory drug is identified in both healthy subjects and breast cancer
patients (Figure 3A, Table 1B). Further, abundance, mass value, m/z value and other parameters

of identified drugs metabolites in nails of selected healthy and breast cancer patients is given in
Table 1 and 2. On the other side, anti-inflammatory drug metabolites such as ibuprofen
glucuronide is detected in both healthy and cancer patients and that strongly support the
precision and reproducibility of claimed VTGE process for the improved precision and efficacy
during LC-HRMS metabolite identifications. Besides above identified FAAAs and drug
metabolites, VTGE assisted purified nail metabolite reveals the presence of smallest size
metabolite 3-methylbut-3-enoic acid with a m/z value of 101.6 and a mass value (100.0524 Da).
On the other hand, the highest mass metabolite is detected in nails as 28-Glucosylarjunolate 3[rhamnosyl-(1->3)-glucuronide] with m/z a 973.4944 and a mass value (973.4944 Da). Here, the

authors would like to draw attention that these two metabolites are known to be secreted in urine.
Therefore, our claim on using VTGE assisted nail metabolite purifications is further
strengthened. Interestingly, mass range of identified nail metabolites matches with the claim
VTGE assisted purification approaches and that encourages to explore the distinct nail
metabolite profiling between healthy and breast cancer patients. Here, the authors point out that
detection of these unique metabolized products and drug metabolites in the nail lysates of healthy
and breast cancer patients is a first report in the literature. To bring the evidence on the presence
of drugs and their metabolites corroborate the chance of success with reference to the highly
distinct abundance of FAAAs in healthy subjects over breast cancer patients.
Reduction in level of FAAAs in breast cancer
Among the key role of amino acid metabolism in tumor microenvironment, a role of
tryptophan and

other aromatic amino acid catabolism is

suggested

that

support

immunosuppressive landscape (17-22; 30-32). In essence, amino acid catabolism including of
tryptophan plays an important role in immune heterogeneity in tumor niche. The metabolized
product of tryptophan as kynurenine is suggested to promote differentiation of T regulatory cells
that help in immunosuppression. At the molecular level, one of two enzymes indoleamine 2,3dioxygenase (IDO-1/-2) or tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase 2 (TDO2) is known to initiate catabolism
of tryptophan that lead to the generation of l-kynurenine (21,22,36). In the present paper, we
show the clear and novel evidence on the appreciable level of FAAAs including tryptophan,
phenylalanine, tyrosine and histidine in the nail lysate of healthy subjects (Table 1A).
Interestingly, among FAAAs, phenylalanine is found to be highest in abundance, then followed
by tyrosine, histidine and tryptophan. On the other hand, level of FAAAs is undetectable in the
nail lysate of breast cancer patients. Here, the claimed methods and process is suggested to

reveal undetectable levels of FAAAs in the nail lysate of breast cancer patients as potential
metabolite biomarkers over healthy subjects (Figure 4, Table 1 and Table 2). A representative
positive EIC of tryptophan (+ESI EIC 186.0788, 204.0893), phenylalanine (+ESI EIC 166.0863)
and histidine (+ESI EIC 156.0768) is illustrated in Figure 4A, Figure 4B and Figure 4C,
respectively. Based on the TIC and EIC of identified FAAAs in the nails of healthy subjects and
at the same time undetectable in breast cancer patients is vividly determined quantitatively by
LC-HRMS techniques. The highly efficient mass ionization of FAAAs identified in nails is
credited to the novel purification methods assisted by VTGE system. Indeed, this observation is
in consonance with the existing views on altered amino acid catabolism and their derived
products support tumor growth and progression.
Metabolic dependency and addiction to use the amino acid by cancer cells are known to
support self-sustained growth and aggressiveness (23-29). In case of breast cancer patients,
abundance of key amino acids, including FAAA in the other body parts and biological fluids is
reduced. Furthermore, this metabolic adaptation in breast cancer patients may be a factor behind
the undetectable levels of FAAAs compared to healthy subjects. At the same time, availability of
FAAA in the tumor mass is elevated and also the catabolized products of these amino acids are
increased (6,26-29). A metabolomic study in pancreatic and ovarian cancer indicates the
glutamine citrulline, and histidine can serve as a potential biomarker (25,29). In prostate,
colorectal and breast cancers level of neopterin and tryptophan metabolized metabolites in serum
is suggested as predictive and prognostic factors (21,30).
The reduction of FAAAs in the nail lysate of breast cancer patients compared to healthy
subjects is well connected with a recent study that points out the low level of serum free amino
acids, including arginine, alanine, isoleucine, tyrosine and tryptophan in breast cancer (stage I-

III) patients (33). A study by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
metabolic profiling and bioinformatics analysis, alterations in arginine/proline metabolism,
tryptophan metabolism, and fatty acid biosynthesis are observed in breast cancer patients (26).
A metabolite profiling suggests that tyrosine, phenylalanine, or tryptophan decrease in
the serum of patients with gastroesophageal cancer. At the same time, level of FAAAs such as
tyrosine, phenylalanine and tryptophan is higher in tumor tissue of gastroesophageal cancer (20).
The bioavailability of plasma free amino acids is shown to be implicated in alerting the tumor
protein synthesis that is widely considered as one of tumor hallmarks. In fact, the profile of
plasma free amino acids, especially, aromatic amino acids tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan
and histidine is suggested to be changed according to the stages and types of cancer. In another
way, intra- and inter tumor heterogeneity may play a role in the distinct profile of free aromatic
amino acids (18). Furthermore, a metabolic study supported by NMR spectroscopy indicates the
occurrence of elevated glycolytic pathway and low abundance of glutamine in the plasma
samples of brain tumors (24). In summary, existing views on amino acid catabolism as a
hallmark of breast and other cancer types is supported by an additional and crucial evidence that
support that breast cancer patients have undetected levels of FAAAs in nails compared to healthy
subjects. Wherein, the accumulation of FAAAs in nails of healthy subjects should be viewed in
line with the metabolic landscape during normal physiological conditions and well supported by
selected metabolic study in other biological fluids.
CONCLUSION
In spite of emanating understanding on genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors that
impact tumorigenesis, a role of metabolic reprogramming is highly appreciated in tumor
heterogeneity. A better understanding about metabolic reprogramming is crucial for prognostic

markers, diagnostic avenue, therapeutic monitoring and combinatorial drug therapy. In this
direction, use of a metabolomic approach to characterize metabolites qualitatively and
quantitatively in various tissue samples and non-invasive biological fluids/materials including
nails is emphasized at preclinical and clinical levels. Based on the above needs and available
avenues, claimed methods that use VTGE system based purification of nail metabolites and their
precise estimation by LC-HRMS promote as a novel and the first report on breast cancer
metabolomic study. Furthermore, the described methods and process is warranted to facilitate
metabolite biomarker study in other biological fluids/tissues in various cancer models. Hence,
distinct level of FAAAs in nails of healthy subjects to breast cancer patients is warranted to be
developed as a clinical assay in the future.
