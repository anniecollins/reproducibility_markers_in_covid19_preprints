Abstract
Taxonomic classification is an essential step in the analysis of microbiome data that depends

18

on a reference database of whole genome sequences. Taxonomic classifiers are built on

19

established reference species, such as the Human Microbiome Project database, that is growing

20

rapidly. While constructing a population wide pangenome of the bacterium Hungatella, we

21

discovered that the Human Microbiome Project reference species Hungatella hathewayi (WAL

22

18680) was significantly different to other members of this genus. Specifically, the reference

23

lacked the core genome as compared to the other members. Further analysis, using average

24

nucleotide identity (ANI) and 16s rRNA comparisons, indicated that WAL18680 was

25

misclassified as Hungatella. The error in classification is being amplified in the taxonomic

26

classifiers and will have a compounding effect as microbiome analyses are done, resulting in

27

inaccurate assignment of community members and will lead to fallacious conclusions and

28

possibly treatment. As automated genome homology assessment expands for microbiome

29

analysis, outbreak detection, and public health reliance on whole genomes increases this issue

30

will likely occur at an increasing rate. These observations highlight the need for developing

31

reference free methods for epidemiological investigation using whole genome sequences and the

32

criticality of accurate reference databases.

Background
Clostridia are a very diverse group of organisms. The taxonomy is in constant revision in

36

light of new whole genome sequence production and genomic flux1. While organism

37

classification can be reassigned, the identified isolates within the same species retain their

38

relatedness. In the analysis of 13,151 microbial genomes, the misclassification (18%) was

39

determined by binning into cliques and singletons with ANI data using the Bron-Kerbosch

40

algorithm, which resulted in the misclassification of 31 out of the 445 type strains2. The different

41

causes of the type strain misclassification include poor DNA-DNA hybridization (e.g. high

42

genomic diversity), low DNA-DNA hybridization values, naming without referencing to another

43

type strain, and lack of 16s rRNA data. Hungatella hathewayi, or its prior designation

44

Clostridium hathewayi, was not included in the previous as there were very few Hungatella

45

genomes in the time of that publication. As more metagenomes are published increasing claims

46

of finding new organisms are mounting. To this point, Almeida et al. reported an increase of

47

1952 uncultured organisms that are not represented in well-studied human populations, where

48

they presented data to support that rare species will be difficult to accurately identify and do not

49

match existing references3.

50

Public repositories of genomic data have experienced tremendous expansion beyond human

51

curatorial capacities, which is an ever increasing issue with the high rate of WGS production4,5.

52

Recently, it was estimated that ~18% of the organisms are misclassified in microbial genome

53

databases2. This high rate of error led to investigation of misclassification of specific organisms,

54

including Aeromonas6 Fusobacterium7, and ultimately entire reference databases2. These studies

55

found misclassified type strains, which calls into question the foundation of the taxonomy and

56

inferred relatedness when population genomes are being used for epidemiological purposes,

57

especially with rare organisms that are not well represented in the reference database. The work

58

presented here uniquely identified a misclassified reference species and found propagation of

59

incorrectly labelled genomes in several highly cited microbiome studies8,9,10,11.

60
61
62

Observation
Based on this species delineation notion, we discovered that the Human Microbiome Project

63

reference genome for Hungatella hathewayi (WAL18680) was misidentified while building a

64

phylogeny of Hungatella species using a population of whole genome sequences12. Both 16s

65

rRNA and average nucleotide identity (ANI2) analysis indicated that WAL18680 was not a

66

member of the Hungatella genus based on genome assessment (Table 1). Population genome

67

comparison analysis was instrumental in discovering that WAL18680 was misclassified and the

68

impact for genomic epidemiology purposes would be important.

69

The misclassified H. hathewayi WAL18680 has been used to generate phylogenomic

70

analysis, reference WGS for metagenome analysis, and web server identification platforms

71

utilizing the metagenomic classifiers10,13,14. Epidemiologically, association with clinical disease

72

will be discordant with genomic data and result in inaccurate conclusions on the microbiome

73

ecology or therapies based on the microbiome membership to mitigate disease leading to the

74

wrong causal relationship to be concluded9. As more microbiome studies are linking rare

75

microbes to biological outcomes, a need exists to quickly identify inaccurate assignment when

76

only a few WGS of individual organisms are available for use as a reference. This creates an

77

issue with low sampling of the genome space for rare organisms and may result in mis-naming

78

based on a small set of phenotypic assays that do not represent the genome content or flux15.

79

H. hathewayi was first described as an isolate was from human feces16 and was subsequently

80

reported in a patient with acute cholecystitis, hepatic abscess, and bacteremia17,18. It was also

81

later reported in a case of appendicitis19. H. hathewayi is (WAL18680) one of the designated

82

reference strains in Human Microbiome Project and is used extensively for binning and

83

classification of microbiome related studies, which confounds analysis of the genus Hungatella.

84

This organism can be isolated from the microbiome depending on the enrichment conditions9.

85

Having a reference species misclassified is detrimental to microbiome research and in

86

epidemiological investigations. To solve this issue, we developed a heurist to minimizing

87

misclassification for rare reference species as a result of cross-validation of the genomic

88

information for name assignment.

89

The standard procedure of the 100K Pathogen Genome Sequencing Project4,5,20-22 determines

90

the identity of bacterial pathogen isolates in clinical samples using WGS and the genome

91

distance (ANI23,24) before proceeding with additional comparisons. This analysis was done with

92

a group of isolates from suspected Clostridioides difficile infection cases. We identified a species

93

of H. hathewayi using genome distance using the entire genome sequence that was implemented

94

for high dimensional comparison using MASH25 (with the maximum sketch size). This was

95

coupled to comparison of all of the available WGS to represent the entire genome diversity to

96

build a whole genome phylogeny12 to determine the naming accuracy of the clinical isolates .

97

Unexpectedly, one particular sequence was well beyond the species ANI threshold for

98

C. difficile. We found that based on ANI, is a putative new species of Hungatella (strain

99

2789STDY5834916). Weis et al.26,27 used this method with Campylobacter species to

100

demonstrate that genome distance accurately estimates host-specific genotypes, zoonotic

101

genotypes, and disease within livestock disease with validated reference genomes. While ANI

102

was the first estimate to raise questions for the accurate identification of this organism, we

103

proceeded with a cross-validation strategy to verify the potential misclassification of the

104

reference species.

105

We advanced with the initial mis-identification by determining the pangenome analysis with

106

the hypothesis that outbreak isolates would cluster together based on the isolate origin (i.e. an

107

individual or location)12 as well as contain the same core genome. We found that WAL18680 did

108

not contain any of the core genome relative to all of the other Hungatella genomes (Figure 1).

109

Together, these genomic metrics prove that this reference genome was misclassified, which has

110

extensive implications as reference sequences are commonly used for genomic identity for

111

outbreak investigations. Additionally, metagenome studies require reference genome databases

112

to identify bacterial community members. This result indicates that if the epidemiological

113

workflow did not include specific whole genome alignment, inaccurate conclusions and

114

misleading deductions will be made – as was observed by Kaufman et al.15 – where they found

115

that genome diversity is unexpectedly large and expands based on a power law with each new

116

WGS that is added to the database. Combining the fact that this is a reference genome from a

117

rare organism from a very diverse group, that the genome evolution rate is a power law, and that

118

this is a reference genome from the Human Genome Project the implications for the mis-

119

identification have far reaching implications.

120

Conflicts of taxonomic classification based on traditional methods, such as phenotypic

121

assays, metabolism, with genomic based parameters will likely increase as more genomes are

122

produced and use of the entire genetic potential (i.e. the entire genome). The need for heuristical

123

indicators of misclassification are needed as is the need to expand WGS that adequately

124

represent bacterial diversity among and within taxonomy to represent the genetic diversity of any

125

single organism.

1. Pangenome of Hungatella. WAL18680 was originally identified as Clostridium

135

hathewayi. After a recent taxonomic reclassification it was renamed as Hungatella

136

hathewayi. (WAL 18680) does not have the core genome of other Hungatella species

137

(hathewayi or efluvii) and possess very few core genes common to the other Hungatella

138

species. The bulk of its genome is not found in other Hungatella species, indicating it

139

belongs to another genus. Strain 2789STDY5834916 is a novel Hungatella species.

2789STDY5834916 (isolated in the UK in 2015) and BCW8888 (isolated in Mexico in

147

2015) would be considered new and novel species using ANI.
