Abstract
Effective and timely disease surveillance systems have the potential to help public health
officials design interventions to mitigate the effects of disease outbreaks. Currently,
healthcare-based disease monitoring systems in France offer influenza activity information
that lags real-time by 1 to 3 weeks. This temporal data gap introduces uncertainty
that prevents public health officials from having a timely perspective on the populationlevel disease activity. Here, we present a machine-learning modeling approach that
produces real-time estimates and short-term forecasts of influenza activity for the 12
continental regions of France by leveraging multiple disparate data sources that include,
Google search activity, real-time and local weather information, flu-related Twitter
micro-blogs, electronic health records data, and historical disease activity synchronicities
across regions. Our results show that all data sources contribute to improving influenza
surveillance and that machine-learning ensembles that combine all data sources lead to
accurate and timely predictions.

Author summary
The role of public health is to protect the health of populations by providing the right
intervention to the right population at the right time. In France and all around the world,
Influenza is a major public health problem. Traditional surveillance systems produce
estimates of influenza-like illness (ILI) incidence rates, but with one- to three-week delay.
Accurate real-time monitoring systems of influenza outbreaks could be useful for public

health decisions. By combining different data sources and different statistical models,
we propose an accurate and timely forecasting platform to track the flu in France at a
spatial resolution that, to our knowledge, has not been explored before.

Introduction

1

Influenza is a major public health problem causing up to 5 million severe cases and
500,000 deaths per year worldwide [1–3]. In France alone, the epidemic of 2018-2019
caused 9,500 deaths. During epidemic peaks, large increases of visits to general practitioners and to emergency departments are observed and often lead to disruptions to
healthcare delivery and thus increase the risk of undesirable outcomes in patients with
influenza infections. To reduce the impact of influenza outbreaks in the population and
to better design timely public health interventions, surveillance systems that produce accurate real-time and short-term forecasts of disease activity may prove to be instrumental.

In France, an important influenza monitoring system was implemented by the Sentinelles
network in 1984 [4, 5]. This system centralizes information obtained from a group of
volunteer (1314 in 2018) general practitioners and (116 in 2018) pediatricians that
each week report the proportion of patients with Influenza-Like-Illness (ILI, any acute
respiratory infection with fever ≥ 38 °C, cough and onset within the last 10 days) seeking
medical attention. Data collection, processing, aggregation and distribution processes of
this information, at the national and regional levels, introduce up to three weeks delays
in the availability of flu activity information. This temporal data gap prevents public
health officials from having the most up-to-date epidemiological information, and thus
leads to the design of interventions that do not take into consideration recent changes in
disease activity [2, 6]. For example, if estimates were available in real-time, information
campaigns and vaccination prevention could be deployed earlier and and could lead to
grater impact. Additionally, healthcare facilities could be better prepared to respond to
unexpected increases in the flux of high-risk patient during time periods of increased
disease activity.

With the motivation to alleviate this time delay, mathematical modeling and machine
learning approaches have been proposed to produce disease estimates in real time and
ahead of healthcare-based surveillance systems in multiple nations around the world.
Most of these studies have been designed and tested in developed nations, such as the
United States and France, where information on disease outbreaks has been collected
historically for decades [2]. Numerous research studies have been conducted on the use
of traditional statistical methods, like temporal series or compartmental methods, as
well as the inclusion of disparate data sources such as meteorological or demographic
data to track flu activity, as discussed in Nsoesie et al. 2014 and Yang and Shamman
2014 [7, 8]. And in recent years, multiple more studies have emerged exploring the use
of Internet-based data sources that capture aspects of human behavior and environmental factors to track the spread of diseases. With over 3.2 billion web users, data
flows from the internet are huge and of all types. Some studies have used data from
Google [2, 3, 9–11], Twitter [12–14] or Wikipedia [15–18] to monitor flu specifically.

One of the first and most prominent studies on the use of internet data for monitoring
influenza epidemics is Google Flu Trends (GFT) [19]. This web-based platform, created
in 2009 and designed and deployed by Google, used the volume of selected Google search
terms to estimate ILI activity in real time. GFT led to multiple prediction errors during
the 2009 H1N1 Flu Pandemic (due to changes in people’s search behaviour as a result
of the exceptional nature of the pandemic) and later produced large overestimations

during the 2012-2013 US flu season (due to the announcement of a pandemic that
finally did not appear). These events led to eventual discontinuation of this disease
monitoring platform [20]. Since then, multiple research teams have proposed improved
methodologies that are capable of extracting information more efficiently from flu-related
Google searches and produce improved flu estimates. Among these methods, the work
of Shihao Yang et al. [2] explored a penalized regression methodology that combines
historical flu activity with Google search activity dynamically, called ARGO, to better
predict flu.

Additional data sources have been explored to monitor flu activity such as clinicians’
searches, electronic health records (EHR), crowd-sourced flu monitoring apps [21–23].
Among these, electronic health records have been shown to track flu accurately and
timely in the US and France [6, 24–26]. Specifically, in United States, Santillana et
al. [6] showed that a model leveraging EHR data and a machine learning algorithms was
capable to monitor flu activity in multiple spatial resolutions that included the regional
level. In France, Poirier et al. [24] similarly showed multiple statistical models that
incorporate EHR and Internet-search data, can yield accurate ILI incidence rates in real
time at the national level.

In early 2019, Fred S. Lu et al. [27] extended the ARGO methodology to accurately track
flu activity in multiple states of the United States. In their approach, they included
Google search data, EHRs and historical flu trends. They developed also a spatial
network approach, called Net, to capture the synchronicity observed historically in flu
activity between each states. Finally, by dynamically combining estimates from ARGO
and Net, they showed that an ensemble approach, named ARGONet, led to improved
results.

Our contribution. In this study, we propose a forecasting platform that combines
multiple data sources and statistical models to track flu activity in France at a spatial
resolution that, to our knowledge, has not been explored before. Our forecasting platform
produces accurate region-specific real-time and short-term flu activity forecasts for the
12 continental French regions, by leveraging national-level flu-related Google searches,
electronic health records data, Twitter data, and region-specific climate data. Additionally, historical synchronicities across regions are captured with a Network model. A
machine learning ensemble approach is proposed to improve predictions by dynamically
combining estimates from these two distinct approaches. Near real-time estimates as
well as one- and two-week ahead forecasts are presented.

We obtained weekly ILI incidence rates (per 100000 inhabitants) for the French regions
(12) from the French Sentinelles network (websenti.u707.jussieu.fr/sentiweb). We retrieved these data in August 2018 from 05 January 2004 to 13 March 2017. We considered
these data as the gold standard and as our task for our prediction models.

Because our prediction period spans 05 January 2015 to 20 February 2017, we utilized
the ILI signal for each French region, from January 2004 to December 2014 to obtain
the most highly correlated search terms using the tool Google Correlate. In this way,
we obtained different search terms for each individual region. The signals obtained
correspond to queries performed by French users at the national level. We retrieved
Google Correlate data in August 2018 for the period going from 05 January 2004 to 13
March 2017.
Electronic Health Record Data

102

We retrieved EHR data from the clinical data warehouse (CDW) of Rennes University
Hospital (France),This CDW, called eHOP, integrates structured (laboratory test results, prescriptions, ICD-10 diagnoses) and unstructured (discharge letter, pathology
reports, operative reports) patients’ data. It includes data from 1.2 million inpatients
and outpatients and 45 million documents that correspond to 510 million structured
elements. eHOP consists of a powerful search engine system that can identify patients
with specific criteria by querying unstructured data with keywords, or structured data
with querying codes based on terminologies.

111

The first approach to obtain eHOP data connected with ILI was to perform different
manual queries to retrieve patients who had at least one document in their EHR that
matched the following search criteria: (1) Queries directly connected with flu or ILI
with the keywords ”flu” or ”ILI”; (2) Queries connected with flu symptoms with the
keywords ”fever”, ”pyrexia”, ”body aches” or ”muscular pain”; (3) Queries connected
with flu drugs with the keyword ”Tamiflu”; (4) Queries with the ICD-10 terminology;
(5) Queries connected with flu tests, positive or negative results.

115

119

In total, we performed 34 manual queries. For each query, the eHOP search engine
returned all documents containing the chosen keywords (often, several documents for
one patient and one stay). For query aggregation, we kept the oldest document for one
patient and one stay and then calculated, for each week, the number of stays with at
least one document mentioning the keyword contained in the query.

125

From the CDW eHOP, we built a database containing the time series constructed
from the structured data. In all, we have 1 335 347 time series. As Google Correlate,
the Pearson correlation between each signal of each region and the time series from
the database was calculated. In this way, for each region, the second approach was to
retrieve the 100 most correlated signals to ILI signal. Because our test period is from 05
January 2015 to 20 February 2017, we calculated the correlation between January 2004
and December 2014.

As a result, for each region, we obtained 134 variables from the CDW eHOP where
there are at least 34 variables common to all regions (manual queries). We retrieved
retrospective data in August 2018 for the period going from 03 January 2005 to 13 March
2017. This study was approved by the local Ethics Committee of Rennes Academic
Hospital (approval number 16.69).

We obtained region-specific weather data from the French climatological website Info
Climat (https://www.infoclimat.fr). It has been shown in several studies that humidity
is correlated with the spread of influenza. [28]. In the absence of humidity data on
the Climat website, we retrieved precipitation and temperatures data. This choice was

made knowing that both variables, [29, 30] and temperature and precipitation can be
used as a proxy for humidity since they are directly related by the Clausius–Clapeyron
relation. [31] We obtained temperatures and precipitations per day for the largest city of
each region, and calculated the weekly mean for both temperature and precipitation.
We retrieved climatic data in August 2018 for the time period going from 07 January
2008 to 13 March 2017.

“grippé”, “syndrome grippal”, “fièvre”, “toux”, “congestion”, “malade”, “faiblesse”,
“courbatures”, “tamiflu”, “la crève”). From there, we aggregated tweets to get weekly

Statistical models

The ARGO model

158

The ARGO model is a regularized regression dynamically calibrated weekly using the
LASSO method [32] to combine multiple external data sources with historical flu information. We performed the LASSO regression with the R package caret and the associated
function fit with the method glmnet [33, 34]. We optimized the shrinkage parameter
lambda via a 10-fold cross-validation. To test the stationarity and whiteness of residuals,
we used Dickey Fuller’s and Box-Pierce’s tests available from the R packages tseries and
stats [35]. The formulation of our model is :

The ARGONet model

201

The ARGONet model is an ensemble approach combining the predictive power of ARGO
and Net models. For this model we tested three methods :
• The first is, ARGONet’s estimate is the ARGO estimate if ARGO model gives the
lowest mean error in the previous K estimates compared to Net model. Otherwise,
ARGONet’s estimate is the Net estimate. The value of K can be 1, 2, 3 or 4.
• The second is, ARGONet’s estimate is the mean between ARGO’s estimate and
Net’s estimate.
• The third is, ARGONet’s estimate is the result of a linear regression between
ARGO’s estimate and Net’s estimate. We trained the linear regression model on a
period of two years.

To assess the performance of the models, we compared estimates to the official incidence
rates from the Sentinelles network by calculating two metrics : the mean squared error
(MSE) and the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC).

• MSE and PCC of the autoregressive model and the ARGO model including
historical data plus the 10 most correlated variables from hospital data and Google
data. The individual contribution of hospital data and Google data has already been
shown in a previous study [24]. But, we added in appendices, two comparisons:
A comparison with the 10 most correlated variables from hospital data and a
comparison with the 10 most correlated variables from Google data.
• MSE and PCC of the autoregressive model and the ARGO model including
historical data plus climatic data.
• MSE and PCC of the autoregressive model and the ARGO model including
historical data plus Twitter data.
Second, we compared the autoregressive model, ARGO model (including all the data

Evaluation of Data Sources as Predictors

In order to assess the predictive value of each and all external data source, we compared
ARGO models that incrementally included external data sources with a baseline autoregressive model, AR(52), model that only uses historical information as input. As
shown in the next sections, we found that all external data sources improve flu estimates,
specially in the one- and two-week ahead forecasts.

EHR Data and Google Data. Our first modeling experiment involved comparing
ARGO models that use Google search and EHR data simultaneously with the baseline
AR(52) in all French regions. A detailed analysis on the individual contribution of
Google data and EHR data into predictions, separately, is provided for completeness
in the supplementary materials. Our findings suggest that each of these data sources
individually improves predictions in all time-horizons. This is consistent with the findings
of a previous study conducted at the national-level and the French region of Brittany [24],
where both Google and EHR information were found meaningful, but EHR data was
shown to possess a stronger predictive power.

The join contribution of both EHR and Google data on predictions is presented below. In
real time (Table 1), in terms of correlation and error metrics, estimates produced using
EHR data and Google data improve the accuracy for all the regions. The combination
of both sources lead to correlation improvements of up to 5% and decreases in error of
up to 30% for the region Bretagne.

Climatic Data. When combining climatic data with historical activity via ARGO was
shown to consistently improve prediction results across all regions (Table 4). However,
this improvement is lower than the one observed with EHR and Google data. Indeed,
climatic data lead to correlation improvements of 2% and decreases in error of 7% for
the region Pays de la Loire.

Evaluation of Statistical Models

313

Here, we compare the predictive performance of four different modeling approaches
AR(52), ARGO, Net, and ARGONet for three time horizons: real-time, one-week and
two-week ahead estimates. Figure 1 displays the ranking of each model for each time
horizon of prediction across regions during the out-of-sample evaluation time period
(January 2015 to March 2017). If a model is ranked in the 1st position, it means that it
led to the best prediction results in terms of error (MSE) and in most cases this was
also the case in terms of correlation. As displayed in Figure 1, ARGONet is the most
accurate model, ranking either 1st or 2nd in all regions for real-time estimates, and
ranking 1st in both the one- and two-week prediction horizons. Further details about
each model’s performance are shown in Figures S2 to S13.

Real-time estimates. Figure 2 and Table 10 summarize results obtained with AR(52),
ARGO, Net and ARGONet models for the period starting from January 2015 to March
2017, for the 12 regions. Over this time period, the 90% confidence interval (CI) of
the best correlation is [0.915;0.971] with a median value equal to 0.950. The 90% CI
of the relative error is [0.057;0.169] with a median value equal to 0.096 which implies a
reduction of the error from 5% to 17% thanks to our models.

Figure 3 confirms, region by region, that the best PCC and MSE are mostly obtained
with ARGONet for real-time predictions. In this time-horizon, ARGO shows good
performance.
For 5 regions the best model is ARGO with the highest PCC and the lowest MSE.
For the other 7 regions, the best model is ARGONet. For the one- and two-week time
horizons, Figures 7, 11, 14 and 15 confirm that ARGONet outperforms all other models.

To assess the statistical significance of the improved prediction power of ARGONet, we
constructed a 95% confidence interval for the relative efficiency of ARGONet compared to
the autoregressive model (the error of ARGONet is in the denominator). Table 11 shows
that in real-time, the improvement obtained thanks to the ARGONet model compared
to the autoregressive model is statistically significant for all regions. Depending on the
region, ARGONet allows to reduce the error by 15% to 60%.

Figure 4 and Figure 5 show a typical example of plot and heatmap obtained for estimates
in real time. The heatmap allows to visualize coefficients used for ARGO model. On
these plots, we can see that all models have estimates close to the gold standard. However,
for the autoregressive model, there is a time lag more important. On the heatmap, we
can see that ARGO model uses mostly 5 variables including 2 variables from Google
Data, 2 variables from Hospital Data and 1 variable from Historical Data.

One-week ahead estimates. Figure 6 and Table 12 show results for one-week ahead
forecasts for the time period January 2015-March 2017. Over this time period, the 90%
CI of the best correlation is [0.852;0.970] with a median value equal to 0.936. The 90%
CI of the relative error is [0.060;0.294] with a median value equal to 0.127 which implies
a reduction of the error from 6% to 30% thanks to our models.

For one-week ahead forecasts the best model is ARGONet. AR(52) is the model giving
the worst results, but, in contrast to real-time results, ARGO and Net models are
comparable. Indeed, for 4 regions, Net model allows to have better results than ARGO
model. We can also observe these results on barplots (Figure 7) and on the distribution
of correlation and error (Figures 14 and 15).

Table 12 shows that the improvement obtained thanks to the ARGONet model compared
to the autoregressive model is statistically significant for all regions for one-week ahead
estimate. Depending on the region, ARGONet allows to reduce the error by 55% to
87%.

Figure 8 shows one-week ahead estimate obtained for the french region Nouvelle-Aquitaine.
On this plot, we can see that AR(52) and ARGO models still have a lag of one or two
weeks. It is not the case for Net and ARGONet models. On this plot, estimates obtained
with Net and ARGONet models are comparable. Figure 9, the heatmap shows that
ARGO model uses mostly 9 variables including 2 variables from Google Data, 2 variables
from Hospital Data, one variable from Climatic data and one variable from Historical

Two-week ahead estimate. Figure 10 and Table 14 show results for two-week ahead
forecasts for the time period January 2015-March 2017. Over this time period, the 90%
CI of the best correlation is [0.825;0.935] with a median value equal to 0.885. The 90%
CI of the relative error is [0.129;0.347] with a median value equal to 0.229 which implies
a reduction of the error from 13% to 35% thanks to our models. Like for real-time and
one-week ahead forecasts, AR(52) is the model giving the worst estimates. For all french
regions, the best model is ARGONet with the method using the mean between estimates
obtained from ARGO and Net models.

Table 15 shows that the improvement obtained thanks to the ARGONet model compared
to the autoregressive model is statistically significant for all regions for two-week ahead
estimate. Depending on the region, ARGONet allows to reduce the error by 60% to
82%.

one-week ahead estimate, we can see that estimates obtained with AR(52) and ARGO

unlike ARGONet model, Net model tends to overestimate the peaks. On the heatmap

Discussion

391

We have introduced a machine learning ensemble methodology that combines multiple
data sources and multiple statistical approaches to accurately track flu activity in the 12
continental regions of France. To the best of our knowledge, this is a spatial resolution for
which no forecasting approaches have been explored before in France. Our methodology
provides real-time estimates as well as one- and two-week ahead forecasts.

392
393
394
395
396
397

The success of our approach comes from the ability to dynamically identify the appropriate method and data sources to produce the best disease activity estimates for a given
location and time horizon in a prospective way (out-of-sample). Specifically, we show
that the ARGO model alone (one that does not incorporate flu activity from neighboring
regions) yields accurate results for real-time estimates but fails to produce optimal predictions for longer-term time-horizons. We find that the Net model (one that leverages
information from neighboring regions alone) leads to reasonable flu predictions but tends
to overestimate epidemic peaks. The proposed ensemble approach, named ARGONet
(that combines information from both ARGO and the Net model), an extension of a
model proposed in the USA [27], produces forecasts with the lowest errors and highest
correlation as captured by Figure 1. This machine-learning ensemble approach displays
both accuracy and robustness to estimate ILI activity up to two-weeks ahead of time at
the french regional level.

Prediction error reductions are observed when using ARGONet over its autoregressive
counterpart (up to 50% across regions) in real-time predictions. Whereas the prediction
performance of ARGONet and ARGO are comparable (Table 10) in this same task.
As the time-horizon of prediction increases, the improvements of predictions are more
evident, leading to up to 80% error reductions when comparing ARGONet with AR, and
up to 60% error reduction of ARGONet over ARGO for one-week ahead predictions; and
up to 80% (ARGONet vs AR) and 30% (ARGONet vs ARGO) respectively in two-week
ahead predictions (Tables 11 and 12). Figures S2 through S13 show these results graphically. As expected, autoregressive approaches show ”within-range” prediction values
that consistently lag behind the observed disease activity and lead to under-predictions
close to peak activity.

We find that all external data sources contribute to improving local flu estimates,
when compared to the baseline autoregressive model, specially for longer-term forecasts.
Indeed, for the two-week ahead estimates, the combination of EHR data and Google
data lead to correlation improvements of up to 25% and decreases in error of up to 60%.
For Climatic data, this improvement reaches 20% for correlation and 25% for the error.
For Twitter data, it reaches 20% for both correlation and error. By analyzing heatmaps
(Figures 5, 9 and 13 and in the Supplementary materials) obtained for ARGO models,
we can see that the contributions of different predictors (data sources) change over time
and time-horizon of prediction, but all data sources appear to posses predictive power.
Indeed, the most important data sources are EHR data and Google data in real-time
and for longer-term forecasts. Historical data is consistently used in real-time, but less
used for longer-term forecasting. Conversely, Climatic data and Twitter data are used
more prominently for longer-term forecasts than for real-time estimate.

The fact that we could only access EHR data from Rennes University Hospital, and thus
from the Brittany region, prevented us from being able to quantify the added valued
of region-specific EHR information on flu predictions in their respective region. This
should be evaluated in future research efforts. On the other hand, we find interesting
the fact that data from a hospital in Rennes can improve flu forecasting in other regions.

Indeed, tables S4 to S6 show that forecasts that include Rennes’ EHR information,
up to two weeks, are more accurate for all the regions when compared to the baseline
autoregressive model. Rennes’ EHR data appears to be more relevant for some regions
than others. For example, it appears to be an important predictor in the Brittany
region (which contains Rennes) as expected, as well as in Normandy, which shares a
border with Brittany. For Occitanie, Rennes’ EHR data improves predictions, which is
in alignment with the fact that historical information shows that flu activity tends to
occur synchronously (with a correlation of 0.93) as seen in Figure S1. We hypothesize
that having access to region-specific EHR data, from all the french regions, will lead to
prediction improvements across the board.

Twitter data was collected at the National level given the sparsity of relevant flu-related
Tweets at the regional level. This was the case as we only had access to the publicly
available data shared by Twitter’s API that only allows users to view up to 5% of all
Geo-coded Tweets (themselves a small fraction of about 5% of the total corpus of all
Tweets). We also suspect that gaining access to higher volumes of Tweets at the regional
level could improve our forecasts.

455
456
457
458

For climatic data, we only had a access to weekly local temperature and precipitation.
Future studies may explore incorporating other climatic indicators known to be more
directly related to the transmission of the virus, such as humidity [28].

461
462
463
464

To conclude, we have shown that Internet-based data sources can yield accurate influenza
estimates in the 12 continental regions in France. Operational implementations of these
methods may prove to be useful for public health officials in the face of public health
threats. Our regional-level flu estimates may contribute to better management of patients’
flow in general practitioners’ offices and in hospitals, particularly emergency departments.
