Abstract
According to the guidelines of the European Society of Hypertension International Protocol revision 2010,
the requirements for long time blood pressure measurement (BPM) are: simple handling, robustness against
movements, accuracy of better than ± 5 mmHg, and, above all, that the patient’s motion should not be
restricted during measurement. These requirements are in particular important for a reliable interpretation
of the blood pressure (BP) of hypertensive patients, because such a diagnosis will usually be confirmed by
long-term measurement. Moreover, to be able to correlate the patient’s BP with his normal daily activity,
non-obstructive non-invasive methods are desired to reduce the patient’s load.
The main concern of this paper is to present a novel method for estimating non-invasive continuous
blood pressure (CBP) from a single photoplethysmography (PPG) signal. In contrast to the pulse transit
time (PTT) method, our approach is based on the assumption that the phase-velocities of the fundamental
and higher harmonics depend on the (non-linear) elastic properties of the arteries. Consequently, phase
velocity varies as a function of a vessel’s instantaneous dilation and can be effectively utilised for CBP
estimation.
In addition to its numerous advantages for a simplified measurement setup, we could show that the
method achieves a high degree of correlation for a reliable BP estimation from PPG data. Comparison with
state-of-the-art PTT methods was carried out using a dataset from the PhysioBank Database comprising a
reference invasive blood pressure (IBP) signal measured at the radial artery, a PPG signal measured at the
fingertip and a standard ECG signal.
The correlation values obtained from the long-time estimation of the systolic blood pressure (SBP)
were as high as r = 0.8945, while the value for the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was found to be r
= 0.9082 and the correlation of the mean blood pressure (MBP) was r = 0.9322. These results were
achieved by analysing the dataset in a beat-to-beat manner and regarding several post-processing procedures
like coherent averaging (CA) and zero padding with quasi-continuous frequency domain estimation and
artificially refined frequency resolution.
Keywords: blood pressure estimation, cuff-less blood pressure measurement, coherent averaging harmonic

1. Introduction
Blood pressure as a vital sign is regarded as the most important parameter of the cardiovascular system
(CVS), and it is commonly used as an indicator of general health, especially for people of advanced age,
who have a higher risk of developing heart diseases. Furthermore, high BP is known to increase the risk of
cardiovascular disease which is the main cause of death worldwide [1].
To ensure a reliable diagnosis of hypertension, CBP is performed over a period of 24 hours and under
normal conditions. Further, non-invasive non-obstructive methods are preferred that reduce the patient’s
discomfort as much as possible. An overview about the different BPM methods and their advantages and
disadvantages is given in [2–4]. Cuff-based methods usually require at least two minutes of spare time
between subsequent measurements to reduce measurement errors caused by the external compression of
the tissue. While their results are not continuous in time, they put a high burden to the patient. Even
if the number of inflations during a 24h measurement are perceived to be quite frequent, the resulting
BP time series has a very low time resolution. Continuous beat-to-beat measurements of BP obtained by
the computation of the PTT from electrocardiography (ECG) and peripheral PPG signals however, are
disputable for several reasons: (i) the dependency on the location and the distance of measurement points,
(ii) the method used to find and interpret minima, maxima and saddle points within the PPG and ECG
signals [5, 6], (iii) the appearance of undetermined fluctuations in the time between the pressure wave and
the ECG R-peak during blood ejection of the left ventricle [7] and (iv) the influences of auto-regulation
on arterial stiffness that produce undetermined drifts of the PTT over time [8]. Nonetheless, the PTT
method is subject of several publications that aim at a development of wearable continuous BPM devices
[5, 9–13]. As PTT-based methods compute the BP by employing its correlation with the actual pulse wave
velocity (PWV), the particular drawback of this approach is that PWV depends on the elasticity of the
tested artery section, which in turn is considerably affected by a variety of physiological mechanisms of BP
regulation.
The general relationship between BP and PTT was subject of a series of investigations. In [6, 14–22]
different magnitudes for the computation of the PTT are based on the calculation of the time difference
between the ECG R-peak and some reference within the PPG signal and are methodically described and
validated by calculating a correlation to the IBP. In addition to the methodological aspects of the BP
computation using the PTT, [23] also discusses the impact of influencing factors, like changes in individual

arterial stiffness. It was found that the method could sufficiently satisfy the requirements of BP monitoring
during sleep, according to low regulation activity of the arteries. The method was tested on ten subjects
with errors less than 8% in relation to the reference mean arterial pressure. Furthermore, the correlation of
the PTT and the SBP/DBP was investigated for different patient groups of 10 to 64 subjects with all ages
and health conditions [5, 24–27]. In the framework of these investigations, the correlation coefficient r of
the PTT and the SBP was found to be in the range 0.73 ≤ |r| ≤ 0.95.
However, all currently available methods require the analysis of at least two signals, the ECG and the
PPG, to compute the PTT. Moreover, since the resulting PTT strongly depends on some choice analysis, it
remains unclear how the optimal measurement location and the reference points within the time series are
determined.
In this paper, we present a new method to determine the continuous BP from a single standard PPG
signal measured at the fingertip and its application to a dataset taken from [28] that comprises PPG, ECG
and IBP signals, all measured in-sync and with a sample rate of fs = 125 Hz. In contrast to previously
proposed methods, we analyse the PPG signal in the frequency domain and compute the harmonic phase
shift between the fundamental and the first harmonic frequency. This phase-shift is caused by the nonlinear compliance of the arteries, which has the effect that a wave with a larger amplitude propagates at
a higher phase velocity than a wave with a smaller amplitude. With phase-shift related to compliance
and compliance related to pressure, the correlation of phase-shift and BP can be calculated and exploited.
Finally, the correlation results of the proposed method are compared to the standard PTT procedure.

2. Methods
Non-linear arterial compliance is known to be the physiological basis to predict the BP from changes in
PTT resulting from a change of PWV along some arterial section. The proposed method, however, analyses
phase-shifts in the frequency domain caused by a similar effect. With the fundamental frequency determined
by the heart rate (HR), the increase of PWV at higher pressures also goes along with relative phase-shifts
between the frequencies in the spectrum of the waveform found in the PPG signal.
Physiological regulation processes neglected, any change in BP induces a change in artery stiffness, expressed as incremental elastic modulus E ( (p)). Equation 1, known as Moens-Korteweg Equation, describes
the relationship between the PWV and the geometrical and elastic parameters, where  (p) is the circumferential elongation of the artery according to changes in transmural pressure p. h and d denote the vessel’s
wall thickness and diameter respectively and ρ the fluid density [24, 29–35].

increase exponentially with mean distending pressure [32]. With PWV depending on the BP, the phase
velocities of the components in the pulse wave spectrum are further affected by instantaneous pressure.
The Fourier spectrum of the (continuous) PPG signal particularly includes the fundamental and its
first harmonic, with the amplitude of the fundamental being significantly larger than the amplitude of the
harmonic. Consequently, any change in BP that alters the elastic modulus will affect the fundamental
frequency more than the harmonic, and thus cause a mutual phase-shift that can be quantified by spectrum
analysis and correlated with the BP. Evidently this method can be conducted with any other pair of
frequencies contained in the spectrum that has significantly differing characteristics. For an alternative
approach, Soliton theory would offer itself to describe this relationship in terms of the propagation speed of
weakly non-linear waves in a tube in time domain [36].
In the following, we describe in more detail how the signal is divided into subsequent heartbeats and how
the fundamental frequency and the first harmonic are determined by use of the discrete Fourier transform
(DFT) in order to compute the mutual phase-shift between these two frequencies. Second, we introduce
and evaluate several post-processing methods that optimise the results in terms of time resolution and
correlation.
2.1. Data Basis
The proposed method is applied using a dataset from the ”UCI Machine Learning Repository” of the
University of California, Irvine [37], which is part of the ”PhysioNet” data base [38]. The dataset consists
of three vital signals (PPG, ECG and IBP), all sampled at a rate of 125 Hz over a total time of 8m and 57s.
In order to correct the time shift caused by the measurement setup, the PPG signal is shifted by 296 ms.
During the measurement the SBP varied between 106 mmHg and 180 mmHg, while the DBP and HR ranged
from 54 mmHg to 75 mmHg and 74 bpm to 107 bpm respectively. The MBP is calculated as the arithmetic
mean of systolic and diastolic blood pressure. In total, the signal extends over Np = 843 heartbeats. The
dataset therefore covers reasonable conditions generally observed in hypertensive patients.
2.2. Determination of Beat-specific Parameters for Further Analysis
Due to the quasi-periodic nature of the vital signals, the method is constructed to work with single
periods in a beat-to-beat manner only. It therefore requires the segmentation of the signal into a sequence
of pulse waves that allows for a further phase-shift analysis for every single heartbeat. The ECG signal is
particularly suitable for this, because the R-peak is supposed to indicate the starting point of the blood
ejection into the aorta reliably. Furthermore, R-peak detection is quite simple and precise from a numerical
point of view [39, 40]. The method we used for segmentation simply determined the maxima above a certain
level and was sufficient with respect to the pre-processing, smoothness and characteristics of the regarded
data. In contrast to available PTT methods, the R-peak merely serves us as a time marker for separating

length, the actual dissection of the periods is done 37 samples after the R-peak as shown in Figure 1. In
order to compare the actual results with the PTT method, the PTT is calculated for every beat. In this
case, the PTT are calculated from the R-peak to the minimum of the PPG signal, as well as the inflexion
point and to the maximum of the PPG and then correlated with the BP.
In order to compare the results of the novel method with the state-of-the-art PTT method, the PTT
is calculated and correlated with the BP. Therefore three different PTT are calculated beginning from
the R-peak to the i) minimum , ii) inflexion point and iii) maximum of the PPG signal. The correlation
coefficients of the three PTT methods with the SBP, MBP and DBP are shown in table 1.
Furthermore, the following instantaneous parameters were calculated and analysed:
1. Pulse transit time (PTT)
2. Instantaneous heart rate (IHR)
3. Instantaneous systolic blood pressure (ISBP)
4. Instantaneous diastolic blood pressure (IDBP)
5. Instantaneous phase-shifts between the fundamental and the first harmonic frequency of the PPG
signal (IHPS)

Suspected linear interdependence between two signals can be quantified by calculating the empirical
linear correlation coefficient r. Given by

this correlation coefficient is a measure for the similarity of two signals x and y, where xpi and ypi are
the instantaneous values, x and y are the mean values, pi is the period index and Np is the total number of
periods.
According to equation 2, the correlation coefficient of two signals is always in the range −1 ≤ r ≤ 1,
whereby a value |r| > 0.8 is considered to indicate a strong correlation between two variables [41].
Apparently, the beat-oriented analysis of the signal has the disadvantage that the individual heartbeats
differ in time length. Therefore, the frequency resolution ∆fi of the DFT can fluctuate from beat to beat
and influence the detection of the harmonics. The length variation can be seen in Figure 3 showing the
instantaneous heart rate (IHR) in beats per minute and in context with the IHPS and the SBP. It calculates
as
IHRpi =

fs · 60s

from the sampling frequency fs and the number Nspi of sampled values attributed to the ith period pi . With
r (IHR, DBP ) = 0.8774, r (IHR, M BP ) = 0.9305 and r (IHR, SBP ) = 0.8936, the empirical correlations
between these variables were reasonably strong, which also becomes evident by the similarities of the graphs
in Figure 3.

while the phases ϕpi ,1 , ϕpi ,2 and the relative phase shift ∆ϕpi ,2,1 of the fundamental and the first
harmonic for a period pi , 1 ≤ pi ≤ Np = 843 are computed as:

ϕpi ,1 = ] (Xpi ,1 = api ,1 + jbpi ,1 )
ϕpi ,2 = ] (Xpi ,2 = api ,2 + jbpi ,2 )
∆ϕpi ,2,1 = ϕpi ,2 − ϕpi ,1 .

(6)

The relative phase-shift is a quantity that describes the difference in phase velocity of the fundamental and
the first harmonic at the certain state of arterial dilation. The absolute values of the phase-shifts (and thus
also any constant synchronisation delays) play a minor role in the interpretation. Furthermore, we note that
the phase-shifts were found to be independent from the IHR that can significantly vary from beat to beat.
While this allows for a consistent interpretation of the phase shift throughout the time series, it also paves
the way to the application of coherent averaging techniques.
The amplitudes |Xpi | and the phases ϕpi in the typical spectrum of a pulse wave extracted from the
PPG signal are shown as double-sided spectrum with the values for the fundamental frequency and the
first harmonic highlighted by solid lines in Figure 2. For further calculations, only the phase of the positive
frequency spectrum is used. Figure 3 shows the SBP, the IHPS and the IHR that resulted from single beat
analysis of the full dataset.
Introducing a quasi-constant frequency resolution allows for a more accurate determination of the harmonics and thus creates better preconditions for correlation. The most prominent options to improve
comparability are:
1. Multi-period correlation of IHPS and BP to increase ∆f
2. Coherent averaging (CA) without overlap
3. Zero padding and computation of the quasi-continuous spectrum ∆f
The main assumption for our method is that any change in the amplitude and offset of the BP is encoded
in the frequency domain, where it manifests as phase shift. Altering the time base of the signal in such a
way that every single period in a batch of periods has the same period length, as it is done in the case of
CA, results to a common fundamental. Since all harmonics are equally stretched, the relative phase-shifts
between the fundamental and the harmonics within the periods are preserved.

several periods of the PPG signal, the frequency resolution is increased by approximately the number of
batched periods, and the relative phase-shift can be determined more precisely compared with single-period
analysis. Further, the sizes of the singles batches can by chosen individually and in such a way that the
correlation coefficient is maximized. As this analysis can be done with respect to the systole and the diastole,
the number of periods being aggregated can largely differ.
2.4.2. Coherent Averaging
Coherent averaging (CA) has been successfully used in similar settings [43, 44]. The idea behind this
method is to unify the lengths of a given number of pulse waves in the time domain by stretching the time
base of each pulse wave to a common duration, e.g. to the maximal duration found within the whole set.
Resampling with a common sample rate will lead to a homogeneous representation that describes every
pulse wave with the same number of samples, so that is straightforward to compute the pointwise mean
and standard deviation of a batch of pulse waves (see Figure 4). With respect to averaging, the method
can easily be varied to evaluate a moving average of pulse wave sequences of some fixed length without any
overlapping.

2.4.3. Zero Padding and Computation of a Quasi-continuous Spectrum
Another common method to improve the frequency resolution is a unification by zero padding each
pulse wave to a given length, which also unifies the frequency resolution ∆f to a common value. Here, the
challenge is to determine the fundamental frequency exactly, since the detection is more difficult due to the
leakage effect that comes along with zero padding.

2.5. Determination of the Linear Regression Function between the IHPS and the SBP
To describe the statistical relationship between the SBP and the IHPS it is required to choose a regression
function. A scatter plot of the relation, as shown in Figure 6, can help to find out, whether it is promising
to conclude a linear regression function
y (x) = β0 + β1 · x + ei ,

(8)

where β0 is the intercept, β1 is the slope of the function and ei the residual of a particular pair with respect
to these two parameters. The regression function we used for our regression analysis is given by

and displayed in Figure 6 together with the confidence interval and the prediction interval for further data
with respect to a statistical significance of α = 0.05. Note that these results relate to the IHPS obtained by
the multi period analysis.

and plotting them together with the residuals against the period index Np , as shown in Figure 7. The
probability plot according to requirement (iii) is shown in Figure 8. It indicates normal distribution if the
data points spread in a linear fashion around the expectation value and approximate a straight line – and
comes out well for our dataset.
2.6. Method Verification by Synthetic PPG Signals from Regression Analysis
The correlation between the BP and the IHPS can in turn also be utilized to simulate the effect of a
pressure change on a given PPG signal. Taking some SBP (or DBP) value as argument, the generator
function can compute the corresponding modulation of the PPG signal by exploiting the correlation given
by the linear regression function (see equations 8 and 9).
Figure 9 shows the results of such a synthetic modulation conducted with a series of systolic pressures
given by sbp [k] = 110mmHg + k · 3.5mmHg, for {k ∈ N | 0 ≤ k ≤ 20}. Varying the SBP between 110 and
180 mmHg complied well with the value range found in the previously analysed dataset. The superposed
graphs indicate how the PPG signal morphs in response to an increase of the SBP in discrete steps of 3.5
mmHg.
To validate the phase-shift analysis function of our method, the output of the generator function can
be analysed in the same way as a measured PPG signal (with known segmentation). Proper operation is
indicated if the phase-shift analysis function exactly finds the IHPS and SBP used for sample generation,
provided the parameters of the regression function are known.

3. Results
DFT evaluation of a single PPG signal in a beat-to-beat manner with subsequent phase analysis revealed
a strong correlation between the IHPS and the IBP. The essential ingredient for the calculation of the IHPS
is a precise segmentation of the PPG signal into single pulse waves, which can be accomplished by finding
the time indices of the R-peak maxima in the ECG signal, if available. Regarding each pulse wave as full
period of a signal, it is straightforward to decompose the signal into a fundamental and its harmonics by
DFT. With this pre-processing, specific regression analysis was done by relating the relative phase-shifts
between the fundamental and the first harmonic of the single pulse waves to the SBP and the DBP provided
by the corresponding IBP signal. Additionally, different post-processing methods were studied that further
increased the correlation values. Table 1 shows the obtained results in a concise way and with the strongest
correlations highlighted, for comparison the state-of-the-art the correlation coefficients resulting from the
PTT method are given side by side. However strongest correlation PTT to BP was observed for the P T Tmax
which has a mean correlation of approximately 0.63.
Good correlation values with an average of ≈ 0.85 for SBP and DBP over the total signal duration
of Np = 843 periods were determined for single-period analysis without any post-processing. Multi-period

analysis in contrast, achieved increased values, and it turned out that the stop criterion used by the procedure
to optimize the number of periods combined for multi-period analysis, lead to an average of five periods for
the SBP correlation, in contrast to an average of eight periods for the DBP correlation.
The highest correlation values were achieved by regarding batches of subsequent pulse waves, with each
pulse wave stretched (and resampled) to the maximum length found in the batch, and then applying CA.
For the correlation with SBP the best result (r = 0.8945) of all post-processing methods was achieved by
CA without overlapping using a batch size of 15 periods, while the correlation with DBP climbed up to
r = 0.9082 were a batch size of 11 periods was used.
Zero padding with subsequent quasi-continuous spectrum calculation contributed to the lowest correlation
values, while demanding the highest calculation effort due to the necessary calculation of the quasi-continuous
spectrum.
To support the hypothesis of a linear correlation between IHPS and BP further, the preconditions of
linear regression analysis were checked for violation. The analysis of the residuals with respect to the
determined regression function unveiled no further functional relation, and the probability plot showed all
signs of a normal distribution as well. This confirms that a correct relation was deduced.
Finally, to crosscheck also the algorithm used for phase-shift determination, a synthesised PPG signal

4. Discussion
In this research, we have proposed and evaluated a novel method for correlating the CBP from harmonic
phase-shifts derived from non-invasive peripheral PPG signals. Our comparative study further identified the
post-processing method of CA as best method for correlating the IHPS with the SBP, the MBP and also
the DBP.
4.1. Restrictions of the Investigation
The main limitation for this investigation was the scope of the data regarded. The available dataset
(i) had a length of 8m 57s, equivalent to Np = 843 heartbeats, and a low sample rate of only 125 Hz,
(ii) contained measurements of only one subject, (iii) originated from an intensive care unit (ICU) patient
with no in-depth information available about the state of health, the reason for the stay or any external
factors like the conditions of movement or medication. Further limitations of the presented method relate
to the algorithms used for analysis: (iv) the phase-shift was only calculated with respect to the fundamental
frequency and the first harmonic and (v) an additional ECG signal was used for exact period detection. As
the results obtained by the method are very sensitive to the period lengths, period determination had to be
done with great care. A segmentation based on the R-peak of the ECG signal proved to be a reliable and
robust method.
Despite our very promising results, with regard to the mentioned limitations, the method needs further
validation by investigation that is more extensive. Further studies should focus on a refinement of the correlation between the IHPS and the BP. In additon, a linear correlation coefficient might be too restrictive

to express a relationship that traces back to arterial stiffness known to have some exponential characteristic
with respect to pressure. We are convinced that the presented novel method contains further space for improvement that will increase the correlation coefficient. To harness this potential, it is important to evaluate
the phase-shift more quantitatively, under different conditions and with access to suitable measurements
that extend over longer time periods and originate from different subjects. Additionally, further research
should focus on a method that allows for a reliable period segmentation based on the PPG signal only.
4.2. Advantages of the Novel Method
A main advantage of this novel method is the prospect that one standard PPG sensor providing raw
data could be sufficient for long time measurement of the BP. In this case the benefit for patients would not
only be a simple and reliable measurement method, but also an easy handling that would notably reduce
patient load in comparison to the state-of-the-art cuff based or PTT methods, especially for long time
measurements. Both, the stress and the restriction of the patients during long-term measurements will be
significantly lower than with the standard methods. We expect that by use of this novel method the IBP can
be finally estimated from any pulse oximeter providing raw data, which nowadays serves as standard sensor
in health monitoring. Furthermore, the analysis of the signal in frequency domain avoids the drawbacks
that emerge from time domain analysis, characteristic for the state-of-the-art PTT method. The calculation
effort required for the novel method is quite low, so that the algorithms can be easily implemented at the
level of common embedded systems. In combination with a small sensor, the entire measurement equipment
can be kept very compact.
4.3. Uniqueness of the Solutions
The analysis of only one PPG signal for the determination of the BP in the frequency domain is an
essential feature of the novel method and thereby significantly improves the measuring conditions by the
simple measurement setup using only one sensor at the fingertip. Furthermore, the analysis of the signal
in frequency domain is not dependent on the afore said drawbacks presented in the state-of-the-art PTT
method emerging in time domain analysis, which is also due to the fact that the determination of the phaseshift is a relative quantity in comparison to the absolute time measurement of the PTT method. Beside the
simplicity of the measurement setup and the analysis algorithms, the correlation of the single signal analysis
is as high as the state-of-the-art PTT correlation values. According to its simplicity, we assume that the
novel method will improve the measurement setup and interpretation of BP data of hypertensive patients in
near feature significantly. Analysing other datasets with the phase-shift algorithm have further supported
this method and provide similar results. In comparison to the results obtained by means of PTT in the
correlation between either PTT and the SBP/DBP, the method presented here is at least as good as most
other results [5, 24–27, 45].

4.4. Outlook to Further Investigations
The quasi-continuous analysis of the PPG signal in frequency domain and its good results in correlation
with the BP shows the potential of the novel method for non-invasive CBP determination by means of a
PPG signal in the frequency domain. By further improving the method through the use of better analytical
methods and other transformations or relations, it should be possible to obtain continuous results using this
novel method.
