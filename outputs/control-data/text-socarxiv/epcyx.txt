Abstract:
This study aimed at investigating whether using some instructional scaffolding strategies would
be effective in developing oral productive skills among female English majors in the college of
education in Azulfi, Majmaah University. It also aimed to know the size of that effectiveness. The
participants of the study were 62 and they were divided equally into two groups; the experimental
one studied the course with the intervention of the instructional scaffolding strategies and the
control group studied the same course without any intended focus on the instructional scaffolding.
The study adopted the pre-post design; average scores of the participants were calculated using Ttest. The ratio of effectiveness was calculated using the Modified Black's Gain Ratio. Results were
very promising as they revealed significant improvement in the mean scores of the experimental
group in the oral test as T-test value was (5.41). The evidence indicated that using instructional
scaffolding strategies was effective as the ratio of effectiveness was (1.06). Results highlighted the
real value of instructional scaffolding while teaching oral skills in English class. It is highly
recommended to integrate instructional scaffolding strategies as an inspirable element of English
courses and to further investigate the processes that the teachers focus on while scaffolding.

Introduction:
All the time, there are hotly endless debates around the best instructional practices with adamant
defense and justifications. Still, Constructivism is one of those important pedagogical philosophies
that founded for many effective strategies and techniques in Education. Its fundamentals were
derived from the main natural assumption of learning and knowledge acquisition; learners build
their knowledge on their own when they are enabled to reformulate the knowledge they previously
acquired while guided by the others (Fosnot, 2013). Instructional scaffolding is an important
concept shaped by constructivism. It provides learners with the guidance they need to construct a
clear understanding of their learning and enable them to regulate knowledge without that perpetual
reliance on teachers or parents. At the same time, most education systems in the Middle East
compete to use technology-supported learning approaches and sometimes the only scaffolding type
that is offered to learners is a technical one. Teaching English as a foreign language is one of the
contexts that require abundant scaffolding because the learners try to overcome many linguistic
and cultural barriers during language acquisition in general and its oral production in particular.
Here, the study hypothesized that instructional scaffolding would help English majors to improve
their oral productive skills and demonstrate more independent proficiency in oral presentations of
ideas and topics.
Instructional Scaffolding
Instructional scaffolding is based on essential points of Piaget and Vygotsky who are
respectively the two major cognitive and social constructivist theorists. They posited that learning
occurs when new mental structures are built upon previous knowledge and understandings and
when bridging the gap between what the learners know and what they are able to learn. (Piaget,
1979). To theoretically originate to instructional scaffolding as a concept, it is found to be much
correlated to Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) of Vygotsky that refers to the difference in
learners' actual ability to learn and solve problems by their own and their ability when assisted by
more experienced people. It was defined as "the distance between the actual developmental level
as determined by independent problem solving and the level of potential development as
determined through problem-solving under adult guidance or in collaboration with more capable
peers". As explained by Vygotsky, ZPD refers to "what the child is able to do in collaboration
today he will be able to do independently tomorrow" (Vygotsky, 1987, p.86).
In different educational contexts, scaffolding is much seen as the encouraging guidance effort
given to learners to work within their ZPD. Being unmentioned by Vygotsky himself, the term of
scaffolding can be traced right back to the inspiring paper published by Wood, Bruner and Ross
(1976) which presented the concept of scaffolding given by parents to their pre-school kids in a
tutorial process and they defined scaffolding as a process "that enables a child or novice to solve
a task or achieve a goal that would be beyond his unassisted efforts" (p. 90). Examining the relation
between the two concepts, Walqui (2006) explains that "scaffolding and ZPD are closely related
that only within ZPD that scaffolding can occur" (p.162). It means that a deep understanding of
the concept of ZPD is required before approaching scaffolding as an appreciated technique of
supporting learners' development. From this viewpoint, it can be imagined that ZPD is like a circle
that represents the area in which real learning occurs and it embraces the other elements required

for that leaning to be born. Scaffolding inseparably lies in the middle of the circle being oriented
by the teacher with many other elements like peers and learning resources. At the same time,
scaffolding relation to ZPD is a dynamic lifetime one that requires scaffolding to fade and
withdraw in a certain phase to leave a space for other important functions to work like selfregulation.
As stated by Van de Pol, Volman and Beishuizen (2010), scaffolding –as an educational
concept- "has received much attention in research and an abundance of research on scaffolding in
different contexts resulted" in identifying and stressing its importance in education (p.271). Thus,
in their overview of literature published between 1998 and 2009, Van de Pol, et al. (2010) found
that scaffolding appeared to be most fully developed in the field of literacy and reading
comprehension.
Instructional Scaffolding strategies help teachers identify the best practices of effective
learning. This is due to the analysis and understanding of real challenges and difficult areas of
knowledge and the scaffolding activities teachers design to handle these challenges. An initial
procedure is to design learning activities in line with the scaffolders that would guide learners in
their learning. These scaffolders are obligatory signs that help them recognize their way into
knowledge acquisition. In their viewpoint, Applebee and Langer (1983) identified scaffolding as
a powerful analytical tool because it helps novice learners to carry out new tasks when they learn
strategies and patterns that will eventually enable them to carry out similar tasks without external
support. Proceeding from this, instructional scaffolding should be found echoed in every
classroom. It is an effective way teacher use to assist learners to develop their oral language skills
and get suited to language acquisition. Derived from its relation to ZPD, scaffolding is very
essential in language classes. In fact, research related to scaffolding supports the use of
instructional scaffolding strategies in language classes depending on the impressive interactive
nature of scaffolding process itself (Van de Pol et al., 2010).
Experimental evidence revealed that instructional scaffolding has remarkable efficacy in
teaching and learning in many subject-matter areas (Azih & Nwosu, 2011; Alake &
Ogunseemi,2013; Palincsar, 1986; Pandhu, 2018). Of particular promise is the small body of
research on its usefulness in foreign language classes and supporting teaching language skills like
reading (Chou, 2013; Fitzgerald & Graves, 2004; Reynolds & Goodwin, 2016; Salsbury, 2005),
writing, ( Ahn ,2012) and second language production (BavaHarji, Gheitanchian & Letchumanan,
2014). Therefore, further research must expand on the available experimental evidence base
signifying the effectiveness of instructional scaffolding in teaching different ELF skills in general
and oral one in particular.
Oral productive skills
Improving oral productive skills of learners is an issue that deserved much dispute and
genuinely it depended on amalgamating both assumptions and expectations of teachers and
learners. Although the oral production of language is a crucial part of language acquisition, many
educational systems still focus of the written skills on the ground that most of the assessment

systems require the written format of language production. Teaching many conversational and
speaking courses for years, I clearly identified that learners feel hesitant and shy to contribute to
any oral discussion and they feel they don't have enough command of language or control of the
subject matter. They are obsessed by the idea that the more they speak the more errors they have
and that, of course, will affect their marks. On the other hand, as described by Walqui (2006,
p.160), they may feel and act better if they perceived that their teachers- Scaffolders- "expect them
soon to get more involved and full-fledged members of the active class". In that way, a gap is
observed between the best practices and current ones of teaching and testing oral language
production. This gap relates to the amount of language exposure students have and their prior
academic knowledge. Students who haven't been exposed to enough and appropriate
comprehensible input or haven't pushed to talk and improve their oral skills may need to receive
different types of scaffolding to start producing correct short forms of language and move on to
have full discussion and conversations. Of course, there are significantly big experimental shreds
of evidence of many successful investigations of techniques and strategies to enhance students'
oral fluency and accuracy. Speaking in front of the audience, participating in a group oral
presentation, and mastering the pronunciation of progressively more challenging vocabulary are
important skills that benefit foreign language learners. (Vardell, Hadaway & Young 2006). The
study here attempted to examine how much it would be effective to synergize different
instructional scaffolding and varied oral production tasks to improve students' oral productivity of
participants.
The current study
In the last five years, the enrolment of the English language students in Azulfi College of
education grew with an adequate rate of regular program completion and graduation (64%). Still,
examining students' score records for the last two years in most of the oral tests revealed a gap
between students' level of written performance and the oral one. Students who academically passed
different courses that required written performance were failing in oral tests. (Table 1)

To assure the problem, a diagnostic oral test was conducted among 44 female students in the
English department. It consisted on three questions and required the students to a) apply for a new
job, introduce themselves and give a brief presentation of their skills, b) tell about their favorite
type of food and c) tell who is their best friend and why. The mean of students' scores was (11.2)
with a low percentage of (37. 3%). Moreover, one of the genuine motivations for this study came
from the feeling that I got about students' oral proficiency while teaching Speaking courses. Thus,
the study here attempted to turn around this situation. It hypothesized that the students would

develop their oral skills of the English language if they received more strategic instructional
scaffolding from their teachers. The study built its framework on the assumption that scaffolding
is more than modeling and imitation; it is a process that enables students to potentially achieve
more than an assisted completion of tasks. Thus, there was an urgent need to redesign the
curriculum of the speaking course by integrating the instructional scaffolding strategies. An
experiment was conducted to investigate the efficacy of this integration by offering different types
of instructional scaffolding and to work as a remedial treatment to help students overcome the
deficiency of poor oral production of the English language.
Methods:
Questions of the study
The study aimed at answering the three following questions:
1- Is using instructional scaffolding strategies effective in supporting English majors' oral
productive skill?
2- Is there a statistically significant difference between students' scores of the experimental and
the control group in terms of the total score of the oral test?
3- Is there a statistically significant difference between students' scores of the experimental and
the control group in terms of the criteria of the oral test?
Participants
The study was conducted on 62 female English majors enrolled in English language program in
2018/2019 academic year, in Zulfi College of Education, Majmaah University. They represented
two sections of the speaking course in level 1. They were assigned as an experimental group
(no.31) who have studied the course based on the instructional scaffolding strategies while the
control group (no.31) have studied the same course normally without any certain emphasis on
scaffolding forms. Both sections met once on a weekly base for three hours over 12 weeks. Both
groups used the same syllabus and textbook, which was Skills for Success 1: Listening & Speaking
by Scanlon J. (2011).
The instructional scaffolding model of the study:
The study got to benefit from the literature reviewed through framing the program, identifying
appropriate needed scaffolding strategies, and determining when to embed scaffolding and when
to pull it off. (Anghileri, 2006; Byrnes, 2007; Ebbers & Rowell, 2002; Hogan & Pressley, 1997;
Larkin 2002; Lewis, 2019; Turnbull, Turnbull, Shank, & Smith , 2004; Webster, 2017).
Instructional scaffolding is meant to help students to learn new content and acquire new skills that
are too difficult for them to acquire alone without guidance or help. According to Turnbull et al.
(2004), instructional scaffolding requires developing instructional plans to lead the students from
guided learning to self-regulated learning to execute these plans, where the teacher provides
support to the students at every step of the learning process. This shows off the real loads the
teacher has throughout the whole process. "A teacher is challenged to find the learners' strengths
and build on them to teach the important skills that will lead them either to academic or functional
success"(Webster, 2017, Definition, para.1). According to Gibbons, 2002; Van Lier, 2006;
Walqui, 2006, scaffolding is schematically framed as three related pedagogical scales; they are a)

planning the scaffolding structure of activities and tasks, b) the procedures of scaffolding, and c)
the moment-to-moment collaborative interaction. It was characterized by six features which are
central to any educational setting; they indicate that scaffolding has continuity, contextual support,
inter-subjectivity, contingency, handover/takeover, and flow. This study integrated scaffolding
strategies in a systematic frame that presents instructional scaffolding through three main scales
and six main features. Generally, teaching tasks for each lesson included an oral activity with a
subject related to the main theme of the unit. The instructional materials of the speaking tasks were
integrated into listening texts. Some given similar tasks were assigned to students to be carried out
as homework. Some Matters of shared interest were identified through discussion with students.
These topics were integrated into the course as additional activities or home assignments. They
were extended and merged to the suggested list of matters of interest. This was done as "in every
program for English Language Learners, students’ culture and language need to be appreciated
and validated through class practices" (Walqui, 2006, p.106).
According to Byrnes (2007), Vygotsky identified four phases of instructional scaffolding; they
are modeling by the teacher, imitation by the leaner, removing the scaffolding and finally
performing the task individually by the student with an expert level of mastery. Based on this, this
study adopted the following model to incorporate instructional scaffolding throughout the lesson:
1- The teacher presented the cognitive content, explained the new task and the learning goals to
the student and told them how to use the visual scaffolders, answer questions, reflect on prompts
or interact to any other scaffoldings.
2- The teacher started demonstrating the task to the students while integrating modeling to
thinking aloud. Here, the teacher tried to explain what exactly the students have to do and
provided a model of Think-Aloud Protocol (TAP).
3- The students, under the guidance of the teacher, completed the task following the model the
teacher presented before. They were encouraged throughout the task to use TAP in order to
show comprehension of the task and help the teacher to check their progress, offer guidance
when needed and provide alternatives.
4- The class would be ready then for group or pair work to handle similar tasks with less guidance
and help of the teacher. Here, the students were required to use the scaffoldings by their own
and could create some by themselves; for example, they could state some questions or prompts
for the oral task they have to complete.
5- As scaffolding should fade, individual students would work on some new similar tasks alone.
They would receive corrective feedback from the teacher during their work or receive it later
as the teacher sometimes preferred not to interrupt students' oral presentations.
6- The teacher shows appreciation and gives praising and supportive feedback to the students as
they were in need to feel that they achieve progress and on the right track.
7- The program adopted some instructional scaffolding strategies. They included Reflection
Prompts ( words and hints), Cue cards, Verbal Scaffolding, Modeling, Summarizing, Questions,
Modeling, Reading aloud, Sequenced Instructions, Organizational Segmentation, Visual
Scaffolders (Graphic Organizers-Charts), Reading aloud ( lyrics and short stories) and
Thinking-Aloud Protocol.

Measuring tools and procedures
Oral production Test (pre & post-tests)
The researcher designed two equivalent forms of the oral test to control the learning effect and
transfer. Every form consisted of three main questions that required oral verbal answers. It was
taken into account to select themes that may lend themselves well to student's personal life as the
aim was to test their oral performance features with little stress on content that may require prior
knowledge. The tests were judged by a jury of English instructors who have taught the oral courses
for many years to contribute their recommendations, check clarity and evaluate content reliability
of the tests. A pilot study was conducted to calculate the suitable time of the test and it was found
to be 10 minutes; it was conducted individually and students' answers were recorded for further
procedures of scoring.
Scoring Rubric
Every test was footed by a brief rubric that illustrated the criteria and scoring system. This was
done to help students know what they should focus on and how their oral production should be
like. A detailed rubric was used by the examiner to give scores. It was used to analyze students'
responses, count errors and judge the responses in light of performance indicators. The rubric was
judged and evaluated in parallel to the tests.
Results
After teaching the course, the two groups were post-tested using the oral test form B. students'
recorded answers were rated by two raters. As the experimental design of the study depended on
comparing students' scores in pre and post testing, it was concluded that the resulting differences
regarding the oral productive skills were due to the experimental treatment and accordingly to use
the instructional scaffolding strategies. T- test formula was used to analyze the difference between
the mean of scores of the participants in the Pre and the Post-measurements. First, pre-testing
results revealed that students' mean of scores for both the experimental and control groups had no
statistically significant differences in the total score of the test (Table 2).

According to the above-mentioned results, using instructional scaffolding was effective in
improving English majors' oral productive skill. The ratio of effectiveness was calculated using

Discussion
Results shew that instructional scaffolding strategies provided effective temporary support for the
experimental group students and helped them reach high levels of understanding and mastery of
the content that were unattainable in the same level to those of the control group. For the latter,
some tasks were too challenging to complete even collaboratively. The students were encouraged
to verbalize their thinking and articulate their thought aloud to be heard by the teacher and the
class. It was difficult at the first two classes because of their fears of making mistakes or being out
of ideas. When the students shared the same practice with mistakes being ignored, they started
verbalizing their thoughts more confidently and resolutely. As an answer to the first question,
Modified Black's Gain Ratio was calculated and identified as (1.06) which meant that using
instructional scaffolding was effective in supporting oral productive skill among English majors.
Students taught using instructional scaffolding performed far better than their counterparts who
were not. As table 2 indicated, the mean scores of the students in the two groups were compared
to assure that they are equal in terms of their academic level and their oral production performance
is equivalent. As an answer to the second question, T-test was made to compare the differences
between the average scores of the two groups.
The instructional visual scaffoldings used in the study helped to keep students' attention focused
on the tasks and organizing their ideas effectively. Charts, tables, pictures, and graphic organizers
were valuable in providing vocabulary and structures for the students during their oral
presentation. Verbal scaffoldings like summarizing, questions, reading aloud and sequenced
instructions helped students to minimize failure and relate their prior knowledge and form
associations. They were helped to pronounce correctly, improve all phonological features of the
target language like intonation and stress, and fill in the conceptual gaps to produce oral
discussions and deliver speeches. The last two weeks of the study were really challenging as the
students were required to complete the oral task independently and scaffolding was completely
removed. What happened was exactly the same explained by Winnips (2001) when compared
instructional scaffolding as a swimming tube. They had to use and apply every task without any
guidance or help.
Here, the results of the study were much focused on many concepts related to instructional
scaffolding like learners' ownership of their learning, sharing of responsibility and teachers'
commitment to structure and appropriate learning tasks and environment. As supported by
Applebee and Langer (1983), instructional scaffolding basically depends on changing the role of
the teacher; s/he is the skilled language user who models the linguistic task verbally or written,
who supports and encourages instead of evaluating learner's answers, and who reduces guidance
gradually till the learner can generalize the acquired knowledge in similar circumstances.

Instructional scaffolding helped to accelerate and facilitating learning for students. At the same
time, it requires a deep understanding of kinds and level of assistance and support provided by the
teacher who is supposed to be very well-acquainted to his/her students' strengths and weaknesses
as well. It also requires continuous planning for every task, designing step-by-step procedures of
conducting tasks and proposing solutions for the challenges anticipated by the teacher. Students
also have good attitudes towards any unconventional context that may offer them more guidance
and practice whether it is technical or contextual one. (Abdelshaheed, 2017). Clearly, it can be
concluded that success in using and benefiting instructional strategies depends on the amount of
effort and skills that the teacher has rather than his pedagogical content knowledge.
Conclusions
Mounting empirical evidence confirms the gains EFL teachers can make when functioning
instructional scaffolding strategies as inspirable elements of their teaching. Although most of the
assessment systems require the written format of language production, instructors should work on
enhancing students' oral productive skills, delivery skills, and organizational skills. Results of this
study can be utilized to reconsider the real value of instructional scaffolding while teaching oral
skills in English departments. They revealed the effect the instructional scaffolding had on
students' skill and learning; therefore, it is highly recommended to further investigate the processes
that the teachers focus on while scaffolding.
