Abstract
Although survey data on happiness are increasingly used in economics, their reliability is a longstanding concern. Two recent studies argue that results based on such data can be reversed with
monotonic increasing transformations of the associated happiness scale (Bond and Lang 2019;
Schröder and Yitzhaki 2017). These studies raise a serious and widely applicable issue. In response,
we make three main contributions. First, we derive a simple test of whether OLS coefficients can
be reversed by relabelling the scores of reported happiness and deduce bounds for ratios of
coefficients under any labelling scheme. Second, we show that when reversals of OLS coefficients
are impossible, reversals using ordered probit regressions (as proposed by Bond and Lang) become
speculative from an empirical point of view. Third, we make apparent that in order to achieve
reversals, respondents must be assumed to use the response scale in a strongly non-linear fashion.
However, drawing from the economic and psychological literature, we present arguments and
evidence that respondents use response scales in an approximately linear manner. The paper’s main
ideas are illustrated using American GSS data. Additionally, using German SOEP data, we
empirically show that sign reversals are impossible or implausible for a wide range of demographic
variables. Although our analysis uses happiness as a special case, our theoretical considerations are
applicable to any type of subjective ordinal report.

Introduction

This study offers an analysis of the conditions under which reports about happiness can be used
to identify the effects of socio-economic variables on actual “true” happiness. Some of this analysis
is a reaction to a recent study by Bond and Lang (2019). In that paper, Bond and Lang forcefully
argue that the results of most happiness research can be reversed, i.e. that the estimated sign of a
variable’s effect on mean happiness can be inverted by means of some suitable transformation of
the latent happiness scale under consideration. In a similar vein, Schröder and Yitzhaki (2017) show
that signs of coefficients from OLS regressions of reported happiness are potentially reversible.
The papers by Bond and Lang and Schröder and Yitzhaki raise a serious issue. Indeed, their
arguments apply to any type of subjective ordinal report and thus have far-reaching implications
beyond the happiness literature. It is therefore imperative to give a comprehensive analysis of the
reasons why, and the conditions under which such reversals are possible.
In giving such an analysis we make three key points. First, we derive a simple test of whether OLS
coefficients can be reversed by relabelling the scores of reported happiness. In doing so, our
analysis reveals that reversals are caused by explanatory variables having heterogenous effects
across the distribution of happiness. Second, we show that when reversals of OLS coefficients are
impossible, reversals using ordered probit regressions (as proposed by Bond and Lang) become
speculative from an empirical point of view. Third, we make apparent that in order to achieve
reversals, respondents must be assumed to use the response scale in a strongly non-linear fashion.
However, drawing from the economic and psychological literature, we provide arguments and
discuss experimental evidence which suggest that respondents likely use response scales in an
approximately linear manner. Deviations from linearity seem to be larger for response scales with
as few as three response options. These ideas are illustrated using the American General Social
Survey (GSS) to enable a close comparison with results of Bond and Lang (2019). Finally, using
German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) data, we provide a more detailed empirical application in
which we show that sign reversals in OLS regressions are impossible or implausible for most
demographic variables we consider. Likewise, when using Bond and Lang’s ordered-probit
approach, reversals always rely on assuming implausible ways in which respondents use the
response scale. Although this is good news for happiness research, we also show that ratios of
coefficients are affected by transformations of the happiness scale.
Before making these and some additional points, it is helpful to define our terms and to frame the
discussion. Happiness is typically measured via responses to questions like “How happy are you these
days?“ or “Taking all things together, how satisfied are you with your life?”.1 Such responses are then recorded
in their rank order, i.e. giving a “1” to the first response option, a “2” to the second response
option, and so on. Call these ordered responses ℎ𝑟 (happiness reports) with options {1,2, . . . , 𝑅}.
These happiness reports are assumed to be indicative of an unobservable cardinal quantity of true
happiness, which is a subjective feeling whose intensity is only internally accessible to the
respondent. Call this quantity ℎ𝑡 (happiness true). We take it that most research on happiness is
concerned with estimating the direction and magnitude of effects of socio-economic variables on
expected quantities of true happiness ℎ𝑡 as approximated by ordered categories of reported
happiness ℎ𝑟. Note that we exclusively focus on issues that arise even if one assumes that scale use
Responses to the latter question are often taken to measure life satisfaction rather than happiness. Since this
distinction makes no difference to the arguments of the present paper, we will primarily use the term “happiness” in a
wider sense than merely affective wellbeing.

is homogenous across all respondents and times. We thus ignore the additional problems arising
from inter- and intra-personal differences in scale use (for work in that direction, see e.g. Angelini
et al. (2014) and Kaiser (2020)).
The paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 we analyse why reversals are possible, derive
conditions under which reversals by relabelling become impossible, and provide bounds on tradeoff ratios of coefficients under any labelling scheme. In Section 3 we explore the implications of
allowing ℎ𝑡 to vary with explanatory variables within each response category of ℎ𝑟, analyse Bond
and Lang’s approach of achieving reversals in the context of ordered probit regressions, and give
a comparison of Bond and Lang’s and our approach. In Section 4 we note that reversals typically
require that respondents use the response scale in a strongly non-linear fashion. We then present
several arguments and experimental evidence to suggest that respondents use the response scale in
a roughly linear fashion. Section 5 provides further empirical evidence using German SOEP data.
A final section concludes.

Why are sign reversals possible?

In this section we analyse under which conditions sign reversals of effects of changes in explanatory
variables on happiness are possible in OLS regressions. We introduce the issue by analysing a
special case of three available response categories. Subsequently, we generalize our analyses to an
arbitrary number of response categories. In the last step, we derive bounds on trade-off ratios of
coefficients under any labelling scheme.
2.1

Easterlin Paradox example

Consider the following example. It concerns the validity of the Easterlin Paradox, which states that
there is no long-term effect of changes in per capita income on mean happiness over time. This
particular example is also given in Section A.3.1 of Bond and Lang (2019). Although we are not
substantively interested in the validity of the Easterlin Paradox in the present paper,2 using this
example will allow for a more direct comparison between their and our analysis. The example is
ultimately based on an analysis by Stevenson and Wolfers (2008) in which happiness data from the
US-American General Social Survey are regressed on national per capita income data from the
Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (spanning the period 1973-2006). The happiness data are
individual answers to the survey question “Taken all together, how would you say things are these days –
would you say that you are very happy, pretty happy, or not too happy?”. To estimate the relation between
mean happiness and real GDP per capita in the USA, Stevenson and Wolfers as well as Bond and
Lang use an ordered probit regression.
However, a more straightforward and widely used approach is to code the three response categories
of the happiness question as 1 for “not too happy”, 2 for “pretty happy”, and 3 for “very happy”
and to run an OLS regression of this variable or its yearly mean. The implicit assumption then is
that the resulting rank-order scale (1, 2, 3) of reported happiness ℎ𝑟 is a good approximation of
the average cardinal values of the underlying “true” felt happiness intensity ℎ𝑡 (on a continuous

scale) within the three response categories. More precisely, it is presumed that within each category,
the sample mean 𝐸(ℎ𝑡|ℎ𝑟 = 𝑘) equals 𝑘 for 𝑘 = 1, 2, 3.3
Mean happiness in the USA in a particular year is then estimated as mean happiness 𝐸(ℎ𝑡) in the
GSS sample, which is easily calculated as 𝑠1 ∗ 1 + 𝑠2 ∗ 2 + 𝑠3 ∗ 3, where 𝑠𝑘 = the share of the
sample that reports ℎ𝑟 = 𝑘. Hence, when mean happiness 𝐸(ℎ𝑡) is linearly related to an
explanatory variable 𝑋 (e.g., the log of GDP per capita), the effect of a unit change in 𝑋 on 𝐸(ℎ𝑡)
is given by 𝜕𝐸(ℎ𝑡)⁄𝜕𝑋 = 1 ∗ 𝜕𝑠1 ⁄𝜕𝑋 + 2 ∗ 𝜕𝑠2 ⁄𝜕𝑋 + 3 ∗ 𝜕𝑠3 ⁄𝜕𝑋. Taking ℎ𝑟 = 2 as the
reference case, this can also be written as

In the case of the dataset of Stevenson and Wolfers and their test of the Easterlin Paradox for the
USA (as adopted by Bond and Lang), 𝑋 = ln𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑝𝑐. In that data, the share of the “very happy”
(𝑠3 ) and that of the “not too happy” (𝑠1 ) fell with increasing ln𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑝𝑐 (see the OLS estimates in
Table 1). The last two derivatives in Equation (1) are therefore both negative. Hence, the sign of
𝜕𝐸(ℎ𝑡)⁄𝜕ln𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑝𝑐 depends on the relative sizes of 𝜕𝑠3 ⁄𝜕ln𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑝𝑐 and 𝜕𝑠1 ⁄𝜕ln𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑝𝑐 . Table
1 shows that the sign of 𝜕𝐸(ℎ𝑡)⁄𝜕ln𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑝𝑐 is negative (confirming the Easterlin Paradox for the
USA) because 𝜕𝑠3 ⁄𝜕ln𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑝𝑐 is more strongly negative than 𝜕𝑠1 ⁄𝜕ln𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑝𝑐 . In other words,
the share of the “very happy” fell more strongly with economic growth than the share of the “not
too happy”.

However, the rank-order scale (1, 2, 3) for reported happiness ℎ𝑟, although intuitively plausible,
may not correctly reflect the average difference in the underlying “true” felt happiness intensity ℎ𝑡
between the three response categories. If so, 𝐸(ℎ𝑡|ℎ𝑟 = 𝑘) will not be equal to 𝑘 for 𝑘 = 1, 2, 3.
For example, the difference between “pretty happy” and “not too happy” may be considerably
larger in terms of average true happiness intensity 𝐸(ℎ𝑡|ℎ𝑟 = 𝑘) than the difference between “very
happy” and “pretty happy”. Denoting 𝐸(ℎ𝑡|ℎ𝑟 = 𝑘) as ℎ𝑘 for 𝑘 = 1, 2, 3, the difference ℎ2 −
ℎ1 would then be considerably larger than ℎ3 − ℎ2 . This implies an alternative coding scale
(ℎ̃1 , ℎ̃2 , ℎ̃3 ) for reported happiness ℎ𝑟 in the three response categories which is concave in the
rank-order scale (1, 2, 3) of ℎ𝑟.

More generally, a positive linear transformation 𝐸(ℎ𝑡|ℎ𝑟 = 𝑘) = 𝑎 + 𝑏 ∗ 𝑘 with 𝑏 > 0 of this scale would yield
identical signs and ratios of coefficients in a regression of 𝐸(ℎ𝑡|ℎ𝑟 = 𝑘). For the sake of convenience, we use the
expectation notation 𝐸 for sample as well as population means throughout this paper.
4 We use ordinary standard errors despite indications of heteroscedasticity in the error of some regressions because
these standard errors are larger than, or very similar to heteroscedasticity-robust standard errors (see Angrist and
Pischke, 2009, p. 307).

̃ = ∑3𝑘=1 𝑠𝑘 ∗ ℎ̃𝑘 . Because ℎ̃2 − ℎ̃1 > ℎ̃3 − ℎ̃2 , the fall of the share of the “not too

Thus, if the difference between “pretty happy” and “not too happy” is larger than the difference
between “very happy” and “pretty happy” by a multiplicative factor equal to the ratio of the
changes in the shares of “very happy” and “not too happy” respondents, we will observe a zero
̃ .6 The coefficient estimates for ln𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑝𝑐 in the
effect of a change in ln𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑝𝑐 on 𝐸(ℎ𝑡)
regressions of 𝑠1 and 𝑠3 in Table 1 imply that this multiplicative factor equals 0.0535⁄0.0254 ≈
2.11. In the case of a three-points scale there is therefore a unique7 transformed scale for reported
̃ ⁄𝜕ln𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑝𝑐 )
happiness ℎ𝑟 at which the sign of the effect of increases in ln𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑝𝑐 (𝜕𝐸(ℎ𝑡)
switches. Hence, for ℎ𝑟 scales that are more concave in the rank-order scale (1, 2, 3) than such a
scale, it is found that mean happiness in the USA rose rather than fell with increasing log per capita
GDP (see Bond and Lang, 2019, Fig. A-2).
However, there turns out not to exist any ℎ𝑟 scale which is concave enough to yield a statistically
significant positive coefficient of ln𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑝𝑐 at the 5% or even 10% level. The best we can get is a
positive coefficient of ln𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑝𝑐 with 𝑝 = 0.13 in the limit for ℎ̃3 − ℎ̃2 → 0, entailing
(ℎ̃2 − ℎ̃1 )⁄(ℎ̃3 − ℎ̃2 ) → ∞. In that limiting case of an infinitely strongly concave ℎ𝑟 scale (i.e.
̃ coincides with −𝑠 , i.e. minus the share of the “not
(1, 2, 2); see Table 1), mean happiness E(ℎ𝑡)
1
̃ is identical to
too happy”. Consequently, the coefficient of ln𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑝𝑐 in the regression of E(ℎ𝑡)
minus the coefficient in the regression of 𝑠1 (with the same 𝑝 = 0.13). Thus, although there is a
reported happiness scale at which the sign of the effect of ln𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑝𝑐 on mean happiness switches,
there does not exist a sufficiently concave scale at which this sign reversal becomes significant at
the 5% or 10% level. In that sense, the Easterlin Paradox for the USA cannot be rejected with any
scale of reported happiness. This result is opposite to that obtained by Bond and Lang (2019), who

This higher weighting of the share of the “not too happy” should be distinguished sharply from the normative higher
weighting of the happiness of the “not too happy” in a Rawlsian type of social welfare function. The former higher
weighting is purely due to a non-normative concave scale of the underlying true happiness intensity ℎ𝑡.
6 Note that Equation (2) also becomes zero if ℎ
̃ 3 − ℎ̃2 = ℎ̃2 − ℎ̃1 = 0, but such a degenerate scale is excluded by
the obvious constraint ℎ̃1 < ℎ̃2 < ℎ̃3 .

found such significant sign reversals for sufficiently skewed latent happiness scales in a different
approach (Section A.3.1). Their method will be investigated in Section 3.
Finally, because the negative coefficient of ln𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑝𝑐 in the regression of 𝐸(ℎ𝑡) for the linear rankorder scale of ℎ𝑟 is not significant, the last column of Table 1 also reports estimates for the case
of a reported happiness scale which is just convex enough to yield a significant negative coefficient
of ln𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑝𝑐 (at the 5% level; found numerically).
2.2

Fundamental cause of possibility of sign reversal

In the example of the previous section, the possibility of a sign reversal of the effect of log per capita
GDP on mean happiness 𝐸(ℎ𝑡) is caused by the fact that the effects of log per capita GDP on both
the share of the “very happy” (𝑠3 ) and that of the “not too happy” (𝑠1 ) are negative. Hence, while
an increase in per capita GDP made some “not too happy” people “pretty happy” (i.e. happier), it
also made some “very happy” people “pretty happy” (i.e. less happy).8 Thus, the sign of the effect
of per capita GDP on individual happiness is heterogeneous across its distribution. This is the
fundamental cause of the possibility of sign reversals. In our view, this point is not made sufficiently
explicit in the theoretical analyses of Schröder and Yitzaki (2017) and Bond and Lang (2019). In
the next section, we show that this feature holds more generally for any number of response
categories.
An equivalent formulation of the same point is as follows. The cumulative response share of those
responding with “not too happy” or “pretty happy” (𝑠1 + 𝑠2 = 1 − 𝑠3 ) increases with log per capita
GDP (𝜕(𝑠1 + 𝑠2 )⁄𝜕ln𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑝𝑐 = − 𝜕𝑠3 ⁄𝜕ln𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑝𝑐 > 0). At the same time, the cumulative
response share of those responding “not too happy” 𝑠1 decreases with log per capita GDP. Hence,
while 𝑠1 + 𝑠2 in a group of respondents with low log per capita GDP is lower than 𝑠1 + 𝑠2 in a
group with high per capita GDP, 𝑠1 in the group with low per capita GDP is higher than 𝑠1 in the
group with high per capita GDP. This means that neither cumulative distribution function of
happiness responses for either low or high per capita GDP first-order stochastically dominates the
other distribution. This violation of first-order stochastic dominance (FOSD) in the cumulative
categories implies that we cannot conclude whether groups with high per capita GDP or groups
with low per capita GDP are happier under all cardinal codings of reported happiness ℎ𝑟 (cf.
Schröder and Yitzaki, 2017, Condition 1, and Bond and Lang, 2019, Section 2).
Thus, the possibility of sign reversals of the effect of log per capita GDP on mean happiness 𝐸(ℎ𝑡)
is a symptom of an underling deficiency of the estimated model, namely that the sign of the effect
of per capita GDP on individual happiness is heterogenous across its distribution. In the present
context, that heterogeneity is revealed by heterogenous estimated effects on the (cumulative)
response shares. One possible way to reduce this heterogeneity is to add control variables that are
correlated with log per capita GDP to the estimation equations. This is because the omitted-variable
bias associated with the omission of such controls may itself be heterogenous across response
categories. In such a case, adding controls may eliminate the sign heterogeneity of the effect of log
per capita GDP on the response shares, and consequently the possibility of sign reversal of the effect
of log per capita GDP on mean happiness. Another potential remedy may be to add higher-order

As a result, the happiness inequality in the USA fell with increasing per capita GDP. Clark, Flèche, and Senik (2014;
2016) found that this is a standard pattern which holds for a large number of developed countries.

terms of log per capita GDP or interaction terms with other variables. Both ways to extend the
estimation equations will be investigated in Section 5.1.
2.3

General relabelling condition for sign reversal in mean happiness

In cases of happiness scales with more than three response options, the analysis becomes more
complicated. Consider how mean happiness in a population varies with a certain explanatory
variable 𝑋. Again, assume that the rank-order scale (1, 2, … , 𝑅) for reported happiness ℎ𝑟 is a good
approximation of the average cardinal values of true happiness intensity ℎ𝑡 within the 𝑅 response
categories.9 Thus, within each category, the sample mean 𝐸(ℎ𝑡|ℎ𝑟 = 𝑘) equals 𝑘 for 𝑘 =
1, 2, . . . , 𝑅. Mean happiness in the population is then estimated as the overall sample mean
𝐸(ℎ𝑡) = 𝑠1 ∗ 1 + 𝑠2 ∗ 2+. . . +𝑠𝑅 ∗ 𝑅, where 𝑠𝑘 denotes the share of the sample that reports ℎ𝑟 =
𝑘. Hence, when 𝐸(ℎ𝑡) is linearly related to 𝑋, the effect of a unit change in 𝑋 on 𝐸(ℎ𝑡) is given
by 𝜕𝐸(ℎ𝑡)⁄𝜕𝑋 = 1 ∗ 𝜕𝑠1 ⁄𝜕𝑋 + 2 ∗ 𝜕𝑠2 ⁄𝜕𝑋 +. . . +𝑅 ∗ 𝜕𝑠𝑅 ⁄𝜕𝑋. Writing the shares 𝑠𝑘 as
differences in successive cumulative shares ∑𝑘𝑙=1 𝑠𝑙 − ∑𝑘−1
𝑙=1 𝑠𝑙 , we can rewrite the expression for
𝜕𝐸(ℎ𝑡)⁄𝜕𝑋 as

Some of the derivatives of the cumulative shares may be negative while others may be positive.
Suppose now that the negative derivatives dominate the positive derivatives. This would make
𝜕𝐸(ℎ𝑡)⁄𝜕𝑋 in Equation (4) positive, implying that happiness rises with increasing 𝑋.
However, the rank-order scale (1, 2, … , 𝑅) for reported happiness ℎ𝑟 may not correctly reflect the
differences in true happiness intensity ℎ𝑡 between the 𝑅 response categories. If so, 𝐸(ℎ𝑡|ℎ𝑟 = 𝑘)
would not equal 𝑘 for 𝑘 = 1, 2, … , 𝑅. Denoting 𝐸(ℎ𝑡|ℎ𝑟 = 𝑘) as ℎ𝑘 for 𝑘 = 1, 2, … , 𝑅,
Equation (4) then becomes

where 𝐸(ℎ𝑡) = ∑𝑅𝑙=1 𝑠𝑙 ∗ ℎ𝑙 . We assume that 𝐸(ℎ𝑡|ℎ𝑟 = 𝑘) is monotonically increasing in 𝑘.
Therefore, only labelling schemes for ℎ𝑟 that satisfy ℎ1 < ⋯ < ℎ𝑅 are allowed. Thus, all the
“coefficients” ℎ𝑘 − ℎ𝑘+1 of 𝜕 ∑𝑘𝑙=1 𝑠𝑙 ⁄𝜕𝑋 are negative.
When all cumulative share derivatives are negative, the cumulative distribution function of
happiness responses for high 𝑋 stochastically dominates that for low 𝑋. In such a case the effect
of 𝑋 on mean happiness will be positive for any permitted labelling scheme of ℎ𝑟. However, when
at least one cumulative share derivative in Equation (5) is positive, there exist permitted labelling
schemes for ℎ𝑟 for which the effect of 𝑋 on mean happiness will be negative. If most cumulative
share derivatives are nevertheless negative, the differences ℎ𝑘 − ℎ𝑘+1 between adjacent happiness
Some trivial adjustments to the argument below are necessary in order to cover the more general case in which the
rank-order scale is a good approximation for average ℎ𝑡 up to a linear transformation. We here omit these adjustments
to aid notational simplicity.

responses for which the cumulative share derivatives are in fact positive will have to be (much)
larger in size than the differences for negative cumulative share derivatives in order to achieve a
reversal. Mutatis mutandis, the same lines of arguments hold for cases when most cumulative share
derivatives are positive, but at least one derivative is negative. The results of this analysis can be
summarised in the following proposition:
Proposition 1. The effect of an explanatory variable 𝑋 on mean happiness 𝐸(ℎ𝑡) cannot change
sign by relabelling the scores of reported happiness ℎ𝑟 if and only if all effects of 𝑋 on the
cumulative response shares have the same sign.
The ℎ𝑟 scales beyond which the effect of 𝑋 on mean happiness switches sign are given by the
scales for which 𝜕𝐸(ℎ𝑡)⁄𝜕𝑋 in Equation (5) becomes zero. When not all cumulative share
derivatives in Equation (5) have the same sign (which can only occur for 𝑅 > 2), there are
infinitely many of such scales. For ℎ𝑟 scales with three response options (𝑅 = 3), the previous
section has shown that scales beyond which a sign reversal occurs, have a unique ratio
(ℎ3 − ℎ2 )⁄(ℎ2 − ℎ1 ), which according to Equation (5) for 𝜕𝐸(ℎ𝑡)⁄𝜕𝑋 = 0 is given by
− (𝜕𝑠1 ⁄𝜕𝑋)⁄(𝜕(𝑠1 + 𝑠2 )⁄𝜕𝑋). For ℎ𝑟 scales with more than three response options matters are
more complicated. To see this, note that Equation (5) for 𝜕𝐸(ℎ𝑡)⁄𝜕𝑋 = 0 can be rewritten as
𝜕𝑠1 ℎ3 − ℎ2 𝜕(𝑠1 + 𝑠2 ) ℎ4 − ℎ3 𝜕(𝑠1 + 𝑠2 + 𝑠3 )

For 𝑅 > 3 this is an equation in more than one unknown ratio variable, which does not have a
unique solution. Hence, in order to get a unique solution, we have to impose a constraint on the
ratio variables. One regular solution is obtained as follows. Assume that each subsequent true
happiness difference ℎ𝑘 − ℎ𝑘+1 in Equation (5) equals the same constant factor 𝑟 > 0 times the
preceding true happiness difference ℎ𝑘−1 − ℎ𝑘 . The ℎ𝑟 scale is then multiplicative like the
exponential scales discussed by Bond and Lang (2019) (see Section 3.1 for more details). The
subsequent ratios (ℎ𝑘+1 − ℎ𝑘 )⁄(ℎ2 − ℎ1 ) in Equation (6) can then be rewritten as powers 𝑟 𝑘−2 ,

According to Descartes’ Rule of Signs10, the number of positive real roots 𝑟 ∗ of this equation is
either equal to the number of sign switches of the cumulative share derivatives in Equation (7)
from one derivative to the next, or less than that by an even number. Hence, when there is only
one sign switch, there exists one unique positive real root 𝑟 ∗ of Equation (7). This appears to be
the prevalent case among sign switches in happiness empirics (see the example in Section 2.1).
However, when the number of sign switches of successive cumulative share derivatives is even (e.g.
two), there may not exist a positive real root.11 On the other hand, when there is an odd number

However, this does not mean that no sign reversals are possible in general. It just means that no reversals using this
particular constraint may be found. In general, when there is at least one sign switch of the cumulative share derivatives
in Equation (5), we can always find a permitted root of that equation by imposing an alternative constraint on the
(ℎ1 , … , ℎ𝑅 ) scale of ℎ𝑟. This constraint is letting the “coefficients” ℎ𝑘 − ℎ𝑘+1 on all positive cumulative share
derivatives in Equation (5) be -1 and letting the coefficients on all negative derivatives be some constant 𝑐. Denoting

of sign switches, there exists at least one positive real root. The number of possible sign switches
can never be larger than the order 𝑅 − 2 of the polynomial in Equation (7). So, if the number of
response options 𝑅 is three (the case in Section 2.1), only one sign switch is possible, but for more
than three response options there can be more than one sign switch.
Finally note that when a positive real root of Equation (7) exists, this can be solved analytically for
up to fourth-order polynomials, but in general only numerically for higher-than-fourth-order
polynomials.12

General relabelling condition for sign reversal in individual happiness

A limitation of the reversal condition in Equation (5) for 𝜕𝐸(ℎ𝑡)⁄𝜕𝑋 = 0 is that it is cumbersome
to apply it to (almost) continuous variables 𝑋 like household income. This is because Equation (5)
requires computing cumulative shares for each different value of 𝑋 observed in the empirical
sample. A simpler procedure runs as follows. Replace mean happiness 𝐸(ℎ𝑡) by individual reported
happiness ℎ𝑟𝑖 and assume that ℎ𝑟𝑖 is related to individual true happiness ℎ𝑡𝑖 as ℎ𝑡𝑖 = ℎ𝑟𝑖 + 𝜂𝑖 ,
where 𝜂𝑖 is the deviation of ℎ𝑡𝑖 from ℎ𝑟𝑖 within its category and has a zero mean. Additionally,
making the simplifying assumption that 𝐸(𝜂𝑖 |ℎ𝑟𝑖 = ℎ𝑘 ) = 0, it then follows that
𝐸(ℎ𝑡𝑖 |ℎ𝑟𝑖 = ℎ𝑘 ) = ℎ𝑘 , i.e. the scale (ℎ1 , … , ℎ𝑅 ) of reported happiness ℎ𝑟𝑖 gives a good
approximation of the average cardinal values of underlying true happiness ℎ𝑡𝑖 for 𝑘 = 1, … , 𝑅 (as
also assumed in Section 2.1).13 Usually, scale (ℎ1 , … , ℎ𝑅 ) is coded to have equal intervals like the
rank-order scale (1, … , 𝑅). Next, assume that ℎ𝑡𝑖 is linearly related to 𝑋𝑖 and a vector of control
variables 𝒁𝑖 as ℎ𝑡𝑖 = 𝛼 + 𝛽𝑋𝑖 + 𝜸′ 𝒁𝑖 + 𝜀𝑡𝑖 , 𝑖 = 1, … , 𝑁, where error 𝜀𝑡𝑖 has a zero mean and is
uncorrelated to 𝑋𝑖 and 𝒁𝑖 (𝐸(𝜀𝑡𝑖 𝑋𝑖 ) = 0). This implies the linear OLS regression model
(8)
ℎ𝑟𝑖 = 𝛼 + 𝛽𝑋𝑖 + 𝜸′ 𝒁𝑖 + 𝜀𝑟𝑖 , 𝑖 = 1, … , 𝑁.
Here, error 𝜀𝑟𝑖 = 𝜀𝑡𝑖 − 𝜂𝑖 is discrete at given values of 𝑋𝑖 and 𝒁𝑖 (like ℎ𝑟𝑖 ) and is supposed to have
a zero mean and to be uncorrelated to 𝑋𝑖 and 𝒁𝑖 (𝐸(𝜀𝑟𝑖 𝑋𝑖 ) = 0 and 𝐸(𝜀𝑟𝑖 𝒁𝑖 ) = 0).14 Moreover,
for the purpose of statistical inference, we take into account that OLS estimates of parameters 𝛽
and 𝜸 in Equation (8) are asymptotically normally distributed (Angrist and Pischke, 2009, Section
3.1.3). This allows the use of t and F-tests in sufficiently large samples. Note that these parameter
estimates measure the effects of changes in 𝑋𝑖 and 𝒁𝑖 on underlying true happiness ℎ𝑡𝑖 .
Next, replace the cumulative shares by a set of dummies. Let ℎ𝑑𝑘,𝑖 (happiness dummy) equal 1
when reported happiness ℎ𝑟𝑖 of individual 𝑖 is lower than or equal to ℎ𝑘 , for 𝑘 = 1, … , 𝑅 − 1, and

the sum of all positive derivatives as Δ+ and the sum of all negative derivatives as Δ− , we can easily solve for 𝑐 from
Equation (5) for 𝜕𝐸(ℎ𝑡)⁄𝜕𝑋 = 0 as 𝑐 = Δ+ ⁄Δ− . This will always yield a negative, and hence permitted value of 𝑐.
Such a reversal condition can be seen as a generalization of condition (3) for more than three response categories.
However, because of its implausibility, the implied irregular scale does not appear empirically relevant.

13 In the context of this individual happiness model, the operator 𝐸now refers to population means.
14 We do not assume a zero conditional mean (𝐸(𝜀𝑟 |𝑋 , 𝒁 ) = 0) because we follow the “regression as a linear

Then, regress the happiness dummies on 𝑋𝑖 and 𝒁𝑖 by OLS as
ℎ𝑑1,𝑖 = 𝛼𝑑1 + 𝛽𝑑1 𝑋𝑖 + 𝜸𝑑1 ′𝒁𝑖 + 𝜀𝑑1,𝑖 ,
ℎ𝑑2,𝑖 = 𝛼𝑑1 + 𝛽𝑑2 𝑋𝑖 + 𝜸𝑑2 ′𝒁𝑖 + 𝜀𝑑2,𝑖 ,
…

(10)

ℎ𝑑𝑅−1,𝑖 = 𝛼𝑑𝑅−1 + 𝛽𝑑𝑅−1 𝑋𝑖 + 𝜸𝑅−11 ′𝒁𝑖 + 𝜀𝑑𝑅−1,𝑖 .
Here the errors 𝜀𝑑𝑘,𝑖 are assumed to have a zero mean and to be uncorrelated to 𝑋𝑖 and 𝒁𝑖 . Note
𝑘
that 𝐸(ℎ𝑑𝑘,𝑖 |𝑋𝑖 = 𝑋, 𝒁𝑖 = 𝒁) = 𝐸(∑𝑁

𝛽̂𝑑1 , 𝛽̂𝑑2 , … , 𝛽̂𝑑𝑅−1 all have the same sign, no sign reversals of 𝜕𝐸(ℎ𝑡)⁄𝜕𝑋 in Equation (5) are
predicted to be possible in virtue of Proposition 1.

̂𝑖 = (ℎ1 − ℎ2 )ℎ𝑑

Furthermore, Equation (9) implies that predictions of ℎ𝑟𝑖 as given by ℎ𝑟

(ℎ2 − ℎ3 )ℎ𝑑
regression of ℎ𝑟𝑖 (with ℎ1 = 1, … , ℎ𝑅 = 𝑅, or any transform thereof, using any other scheme
for ℎ𝑘 ). Put differently, estimate 𝛽̂ from the regression ℎ𝑟𝑖 = 𝛼 + 𝛽𝑋𝑖 + 𝜸′ 𝒁𝑖 + 𝜀𝑖 , where ℎ𝑟𝑖
may have been constructed using any labelling scheme for ℎ𝑘 , can be expressed in terms of the
coefficient estimates of ℎ𝑑𝑘,𝑖 as
𝛽̂ = (ℎ1 − ℎ2 )𝛽̂𝑑1 + (ℎ2 − ℎ3 )𝛽̂𝑑2 + ⋯ + (ℎ𝑅−1 − ℎ𝑅 )𝛽̂𝑑𝑅−1 .

(11)

Therefore, the set of regressions of ℎ𝑑𝑘,𝑖 can generate a sign reversal condition for the OLS
estimate 𝛽̂ . We can then formulate:
Relabelling Condition. Estimate 𝛽̂ of the effect of an explanatory variable 𝑋𝑖 on reported
happiness ℎ𝑟𝑖 does not change sign by relabelling the scores of ℎ𝑟𝑖 if and only if all estimates 𝛽̂𝑑𝑘
of the effects of 𝑋𝑖 on the happiness dummies ℎ𝑑𝑘,𝑖 in Equations (10) have the same sign.
We can apply Equations (8)-(11) for individual happiness to the Easterlin Paradox example given
in Section 2.1. When imposing equal macro weights on each yearly wave of the GSS, the estimates
are equivalent to those presented for mean happiness in Table 1 (cf. Angrist & Pischke, 2009,
Section 3.1.2). For example, a regression of ℎ𝑑1,𝑖 on ln𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑝𝑐 yields the same coefficient as a
regression of 𝑠1 on ln𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑝𝑐, and a regression of ℎ𝑑2,𝑖 yields the same coefficient as minus the
coefficient on ln𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑝𝑐 from a regression of s3 (since 𝑠1 + 𝑠2 = 1 − 𝑠3 ). Moreover, the scale
Note that ∑𝑅𝑙=1 𝑠𝑙 = 1 and that the identity for 𝐸(ℎ𝑡) underlies Equation (5). Further note that ℎ𝑑𝑅,𝑖 = 1. Identity
(9) can be easily seen to hold by noting that if ℎ𝑟𝑖 = ℎ𝑘 , ℎ𝑑1,𝑖 = ℎ𝑑2,𝑖 = ⋯ = ℎ𝑑𝑘−1,𝑖 = 0, ℎ𝑑𝑘,𝑖 = ℎ𝑑𝑘+1,𝑖 = ⋯ =
ℎ𝑑𝑅−1,𝑖 = 1, and hence the right-hand side of Equation (9) boils down to ℎ𝑘 .

For the special case where the regression model in Equation (8) does not include control variables
𝒁𝑖 , Schröder and Yitzhaki (2017) also derive a sufficient condition for the possibility of a sign
reversal of the effect of a change in 𝑋𝑖 on ℎ𝑟𝑖 (as indicated by parameter 𝛽). However, this
condition (Condition 2 in Schröder and Yitzhaki) is more complicated and less general than the
condition presented here.16
2.5

Bounds on trade-off ratios of coefficients

When assessing the substantive implications of estimates, we may be more interested in ratios of
coefficients than in their magnitude. For example, the estimation of shadow prices (Bertram and
Rehdanz 2015; Levinson 2012; Luechinger 2009) or equivalence scales (Biewen and Juhasz 2017;
Borah, Keldenich, and Knabe 2019; Rojas 2007) principally relies on ratios of coefficients.
Unfortunately, when effects are not perfectly homogenous across the distribution of ℎ𝑟𝑖 , ratios of
coefficients are affected by transformations of ℎ𝑟𝑖 even when no sign reversals are possible.
Fortunately, bounds on the ratio of two coefficients for any transformation of ℎ𝑟𝑖 can be given.
Let 𝛽̂ and 𝛾̂ be coefficient estimates from a regression of a particular coding of ℎ𝑟𝑖 on respectively
𝑋𝑖 and 𝑍𝑖 (plus possibly other controls). Using Equation (11), we can write the ratio of these
coefficient estimates as the ratio of sums of corresponding coefficient estimates resulting from
regressions of ℎ𝑑𝑘,𝑖 :
̂
𝛽̂ ∑𝑅−1
𝑘=1 (ℎ𝑘𝑗 − ℎ𝑘𝑗+1 )𝛽𝑑𝑘
= 𝑅−1
.
𝛾̂ ∑𝑘=1 (ℎ𝑘𝑗 − ℎ𝑘𝑗+1 )𝛾̂𝑑𝑘

(12)

From this we can deduce:
1. When all ratios 𝛽̂𝑑𝑘 ⁄𝛾̂𝑑𝑘 of coefficient estimates from the regressions of ℎ𝑑𝑘,𝑖 take the same
value 𝜌, Equation (12) reduces to 𝛽̂ ⁄𝛾̂ = 𝜌. In that case, ratio 𝛽̂ ⁄𝛾̂ of coefficient estimates
from the regression of ℎ𝑟𝑖 does not depend on the particular coding scheme (ℎ1 , ℎ2 , … , ℎ𝑅 ) of
ℎ𝑟𝑖 . The ratio is then invariant under any transformation of such a scheme.17
2. In general, we can view ratio 𝛽̂ ⁄𝛾̂ as a weighted average of all ratios 𝛽̂𝑑𝑘 ⁄𝛾̂𝑑𝑘 . By recoding ℎ𝑟𝑖
such that ℎ𝑙 − ℎ𝑙+1 = 0 for all 𝑙 ≠ 𝑘 and ℎ𝑘 − ℎ𝑘+1 < 0, we can assign all the weight to one

Schröder and Yitzaki (2017) also derive a necessary and sufficient condition for an unambiguous ranking of mean
happiness in two groups. Translated in our terminology, this Condition 1 states that expected happiness in group A is
higher than that in group B for all scales of ℎ𝑟𝑖 if and only if the cumulative distribution function of underlying true
happiness ℎ𝑡𝑖 in group A first-order stochastically dominates that in group B. However, according to our analysis in
Section 2.2, the weaker first-order stochastic dominance (FOSD) in cumulative response categories is enough for
guaranteeing an unambiguous ranking of mean happiness in two groups. In our view, Schröder and Yitzaki are
inaccurate in their proof of Condition 1 in Appendix A5 of their paper when they assume that ℎ𝑟𝑖 as a function of ℎ𝑡𝑖
(ℎ(𝑠) in their notation) is differentiable. This seems incorrect because ℎ𝑟𝑖 (ℎ𝑡𝑖 ) is a discontinuous step function. Taking
this into account can easily be seen to imply an analogous condition in terms of FOSD in expected cumulative response
categories.

effects are homogenous across the distribution of ℎ𝑟𝑖 .

particular ratio 𝛽̂𝑑𝑘 ⁄𝛾̂𝑑𝑘 . Doing so we obtain 𝛽̂ ⁄𝛾̂ = 𝛽̂𝑑𝑘 ⁄𝛾̂𝑑𝑘 . This scale is not allowed
because of the zero intervals for 𝑙 ≠ 𝑘, but it acts as a bound for the allowed scales with nonzero intervals. It then follows that for all permitted transformations of the coding scheme of
ℎ𝑟𝑖 ratio 𝛽̂ ⁄𝛾̂ is larger (smaller) than the smallest (largest) ratio among all 𝛽̂𝑑𝑘 ⁄𝛾̂𝑑𝑘 . We can
hence give lower and upper bounds for ratio 𝛽̂ ⁄𝛾̂.

Analysis of Bond and Lang’s approach

In this section, we first outline Bond & Lang’s (2019) approach to achieving reversals.
Subsequently, we compare their approach, which uses ordered probit regressions, to our OLSbased approach.
3.1

Variation within response categories and sign reversals in the ordered probit model

One assumption we implicitly made in Section 2 is that the conditional expectations of ℎ𝑡 within
each response category (𝐸(ℎ𝑡|ℎ𝑟 = 𝑘)) do not vary with 𝑋. This is a simplifying assumption which
may not be a sufficiently good approximation in cases with few response categories. For instance,
in the Easterlin Paradox example of Section 2.1, the empirical finding that both the share of the
“not too happy” and the share of the “very happy” fell with increasing ln𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑝𝑐 suggests that
among those responding with “not too happy” the rise in ln𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑝𝑐 led to less unhappiness, while
among those responding with “very happy” the rise in ln𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑝𝑐 led to less happiness. This implies
that 𝐸(ℎ𝑡|ℎ𝑟 = 1) = ℎ1 rose with increasing ln𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑝𝑐, while 𝐸(ℎ𝑡|ℎ𝑟 = 3) = ℎ3 declined.
In principle, such changes in expected happiness can be accommodated by modifying Equation (2)
into a more flexible equation as given in Appendix B. That equation turns out to have two
implications (see Appendix B for more details): First, it is ambiguous whether, compared to the
estimates of Table 1, allowing for variation within response categories increases or decreases the
required ratio (ℎ̃2 − ℎ̃1 )⁄(ℎ̃3 − ℎ̃2 ) at which the effect of ln𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑝𝑐 on mean happiness becomes
zero. Second, it becomes more likely that the effect of ln𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑝𝑐 on mean happiness is significantly
̃ in Table 1). However, with
positive in the limit for limit for ℎ̃3 − ℎ̃2 → 0 (see the scale for E(ℎ𝑡)
more than three response categories, an analysis such as that presented in Appendix B becomes
much more complicated and is therefore not elaborated here.
A limitation of this approach of allowing for variation within response categories is that the
direction and magnitude of such variation are not observed in the empirical data. A partial way out
of this is to postulate an ordered probit model for ℎ𝑟𝑖 . This is the approach of Bond and Lang
(2019). A difference in this approach with our approach discussed in Section 2.4 and the approach
of Schröder and Yitzhaki (2017) is that Bond and Lang (henceforth, B&L) frame their analysis in
terms of mean expected happiness 𝐸(ℎ𝑡𝑖 |𝑋𝑖 , 𝒁𝑖 ) rather than individual happiness ℎ𝑡𝑖 . Their proxy
for true happiness ℎ𝑡𝑖 is latent happiness ℎ𝑙𝑖 as given by the linear equation18
ℎ𝑙𝑖 = 𝛼𝑙 + 𝛽𝑙 𝑋𝑖 + 𝜸𝑙 ′𝒁𝑖 + 𝜀𝑙𝑖 ,

𝑖 = 1, … , 𝑁.

(13)

We add the notation of ℎ𝑙𝑖 (rather than writing ℎ𝑡𝑖 directly) since, as will be made clear below, ℎ𝑙𝑖 as defined by
Equation (13) is only one of many possible latent proxies of ℎ𝑡𝑖 .
12
18

Here, error 𝜀𝑙𝑖 is assumed to be normally19 distributed with mean zero and standard deviation 𝜎𝑖 .
B&L thus assume 𝜀𝑙𝑖 to be continuous and unbounded. A certain level of ℎ𝑙𝑖 is reported as
belonging to category 𝑘 of ℎ𝑟𝑖 for 𝑘 = 1, … , 𝑅 if and only if 𝜏𝑘−1 ≤ ℎ𝑙𝑖 < 𝜏𝑘 . Here the 𝜏𝑘 ’s are
cutoff points which are assumed to be common to all respondents. We further assume that 𝜏0 =
−∞ and 𝜏𝑅 = ∞.
In essence, this model is designed to estimate the signs of the effects of the explanatory variables
𝑋𝑖 and 𝒁𝑖 on ℎ𝑙𝑖 on the basis of merely ordinal information in the reported categories of ℎ𝑟𝑖 (see,
e.g., Ferrer-i-Carbonell and Frijters, 2004, Section 3.2, and Vendrik and Woltjer, 2007, Section 3.1).
Implicitly, however, it also implies a cardinalisation of ℎ𝑙𝑖 as defined by model equation (13) and
the estimated set of 𝜏𝑘 ’s (see Van Praag and Ferrer-i-Carbonell, 2008, Section 2.5). B&L use this
implied cardinalisation to compare mean happiness across groups. For two groups A and B this
can be done by letting 𝑋𝑖 in Equation (13) be a dummy variable 𝐷𝑖 for group membership of A
(𝐷𝑖 = 1) or B (𝐷𝑖 = 0).
However, B&L maintain that the ordered probit assumption of a single cardinalisation under which
both groups’ happiness is distributed normally, is strong. They further argue that although the
standard assumption of a constant variance 𝜎𝑖2 = 𝜎 2 of 𝜀𝑙𝑖 across all groups is necessary to obtain
an unambiguous ranking of mean happiness in group A versus group B, that assumption is
implausible and unnecessary for estimation.20 When instead letting variances differ, they note that,
in large samples, variances across different groups will never be estimated to be exactly equal.21
Therefore, neither group’s cumulative distribution function (CDF) of ℎ𝑙𝑖 will first-order
stochastically dominate the other one. Hence, there will always exist alternative cardinalisations for
which the ranking of mean happiness between groups A and B under the normal cardinalisation
will be reversed. Below, we unpack this argument further.
In the context of Equation (13), mean happiness 𝐸(ℎ𝑡𝑖 |𝑋𝑖 , 𝒁𝑖 ) is given by 𝐸(ℎ𝑙𝑖 |𝑋𝑖 , 𝒁𝑖 ) = 𝛼𝑙 +
𝛽𝑙 𝑋𝑖 + 𝜸𝑙 ′𝒁𝑖 . The effect of 𝑋𝑖 on 𝐸(ℎ𝑙𝑖 |𝑋𝑖 , 𝒁𝑖 ) is then assessed by estimating parameter 𝛽𝑙 in
regression equation (13) for ℎ𝑙𝑖 . Furthermore, the variance of 𝜀𝑙𝑖 is allowed to vary across persons
by letting 𝜎𝑖 depend on 𝑋𝑖 and 𝒁𝑖 . The model ln (𝜎𝑖 ) = 𝛼𝑠 + 𝛽𝑠 𝑋𝑖 + 𝜸𝒔 ′𝒁𝑖 is particularly
appealing since 𝜎𝑖 can then only take on values larger than 0. This model can then be estimated
jointly with Equation (13) and the remaining set of cutoff points 𝜏𝑘 by maximum likelihood (see,
e.g., Williams 2010). For identification, B&L additionally impose 𝜏1 = 0 and 𝜏2 = 1.
This joint estimation yields predictions of mean happiness 𝐸(ℎ𝑙𝑖 |𝑋𝑖 , 𝒁𝑖 ) = 𝛼𝑙 + 𝛽𝑙 𝑋𝑖 + 𝜸𝑙 ′𝒁𝑖
′

and (mean) variance 𝐸(𝜎𝑖 2 |𝑋𝑖 , 𝒁𝑖 ) = 𝜎𝑖 2 = 𝑒 2(𝛼𝑠 +𝛽𝑠 𝑋𝑖 +𝜸𝒔 𝒁𝑖 ) together with estimates of the
cutoffs 𝜏𝑘 . The scale of ℎ𝑙𝑖 is given by these cutoff estimates. However, any positive monotone
transformation of this scale would yield the same likelihood. Thus, nothing in the data tells us
which scale is most appropriate. One simple convex transformation of ℎ𝑙𝑖 is 𝑒 𝑐ℎ𝑙𝑖 , where 𝑐 is a
̃ 𝑖 with an exponential cutoff
positive constant. This yields a transformed latent happiness variable ℎ𝑙
Error 𝜀𝑙𝑖 could also be assumed to be logistically distributed, implying an ordered logit model. All the arguments to
follow can be adapted to this model as well.
20 They also note that this argument holds for any unbounded distribution from the location-scale family, not just for
the normal distribution.
21 The test statistics in heteroscedasticity tests have continuous distributions, and hence the a priori probability that
these statistics are exactly zero, indicating perfect homoscedasticity, is zero.

where we use the short-hand notation 𝜇𝑖 for 𝐸(ℎ𝑙𝑖 |𝑋𝑖 , 𝒁𝑖 ). Since this expression for 𝜇̃𝑖 is increasing
in 𝜎𝑖 2 , it follows that if 𝜇𝑖 rises with 𝑋𝑖 , but 𝜎𝑖 2 falls with 𝑋𝑖 , the effect of 𝑋𝑖 on 𝜇̃𝑖 will change sign
and become negative for sufficiently large 𝑐. The value of 𝑐 for which the effect of 𝑋𝑖 on 𝜇̃𝑖 is
predicted to become zero, and hence beyond which the effect should become negative, is easily
derived by differentiating the expression in Equation (15) with respect to 𝑋𝑖 and setting the
derivative to zero. This yields

When 𝛽𝑙 and 𝛽𝑠 have opposite signs, Equation (16) implies that the predicted sign-reversing value
of 𝑐 is positive. Note that this value depends on the levels of 𝑋𝑖 and 𝒁𝑖 . In our empirical
applications, we report the sign-reversing value of 𝑐 at the means of 𝑋𝑖 and 𝒁𝑖 . Since this value is
positive when 𝛽𝑙 and 𝛽𝑠 have opposing signs, the multiplicative ratio 𝑒 𝑐 is larger than one, implying
that the differences in happiness intensity between the cutoffs of successive response categories

Alternatively, if both 𝜇𝑖 and 𝜎𝑖 2 rise (or fall) with 𝑋𝑖 (implying that 𝛽𝑙 and 𝛽𝑠 have the same sign),
the sign-reversing value of 𝑐 in Equation (16) is negative. The sign of the effect of 𝑋𝑖 on 𝜇𝑖 is then

the multiplicative interval scale of ℎ𝑟𝑖 with constant ratio 𝑟 = 𝑒 𝑐 < 1. Differences in happiness
intensity between the cutoffs of successive response categories then tend to decrease from low to
high levels of happiness. In this case, the log-normal distribution of transformed reported

which is decreasing in 𝜎𝑖 2 . Thus, a sufficiently strongly negative 𝑐 reverses the positive sign of the
effect of 𝑋𝑖 on 𝜇̃𝑖 . The value of 𝑐 beyond which this is predicted to happen is again given by
Equation (16), but now it is negative.
B&L do not derive condition (16), but instead present a special case of it for the comparison of
mean happiness in two groups A and B. This case corresponds to 𝑋𝑖 = 𝐷𝑖 in condition (16), which
is then given by 𝑐 = − 2∆𝜇𝑖 ⁄∆𝜎𝑖 2 = 2(𝜇𝐴 − 𝜇𝐵 )⁄(𝜎𝐵2 − 𝜎𝐴2 ). Nevertheless, B&L illustrate their
approach with several examples that involve more than two groups. They do so by means of a
numerical search procedure, which we outline in footnote 25.
One of B&L’s examples is the Easterlin Paradox, which we also analysed in Sections 2.1 and 2.4
(using the same data). When we estimate a heteroskedastic ordered probit (HOP) model like the
one described above, we obtain estimates of -0.045 and -0.165 for the marginal effects of 𝑋𝑖 =
ln𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑝𝑐 on 𝜇𝑖 and ln (𝜎𝑖 ), respectively. The former estimate is close to coefficient -0.043 of
ln𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑝𝑐 in column (2) of Table A-1 of B&L (2019)24, but our coefficient is just not significant
(𝑝 = 0.13) because of our clustering of the standard errors by year (which B&L omitted). Applying
condition (16) at the mean of ln𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑝𝑐 to our coefficients yields a 𝑐 value of -0.73 for which the
effect of 𝑋𝑖 = ln𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑝𝑐 on transformed mean happiness 𝜇̃𝑖 is predicted to become zero. This
value is close to the value -0.67 that can be found using a version of B&L’s numerical search
procedure.25 In turn, that value implies a cardinalisation with differences between cutoffs
decreasing by a multiplicative factor 𝑒 −0.67 = 0.51 = 𝑟. This is close to the value 𝑟 = 1/2.11 =
0.47 = 𝑒 −0.75 we obtained in section 2.1.
Moreover, using the same search procedure, we find that with 𝑐 = −4.34 the effect of ln𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑝𝑐
on transformed mean happiness 𝜇̃𝑖 becomes significantly positive at the 5% level (B&L obtain 𝑐 =
−2.25 because they do not use robust standard errors).26 This is in line with our result from

25

The difference in estimated coefficients is due to our use of equal macro weights for each yearly wave of the GSS.
Their general search procedure has three steps. First, by estimating Equation (13) and the equation for 𝜎𝑖 , they

for some 𝑐 < 0 (if signs of 𝛽

search for that value of 𝑐 for which an OLS regression of 𝜇̃ 𝑖 on 𝑋𝑖 and 𝒁𝒊 yields a zero coefficient of 𝑋𝑖 . When entering
ln𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑝𝑐 linearly, this yields a value of -0.73 (agreeing with the predicted value). However, for the Easterlin Paradox
example, B&L use a more flexible approach, estimating 𝜇𝑖 and 𝜎𝑖 separately for each year (which is equivalent to a
HOP model with year dummies; cf. p. A-25 of B&L), yielding an estimate of -0.67. The difference in estimated values
is due to a strong non-linearity of ln(𝜎𝑖 ) in ln𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑝𝑐. Generally, the last expression in condition (16) predicts the
sign-reversing level of 𝑐 to lie in a range between the value of the expression for the highest level of ln𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑝𝑐 (=10.80,
yielding 𝑐=-0.81) and the value for the lowest level of ln𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑝𝑐 (=10.13, yielding 𝑐=-0.65) in the sample.

that are robust to such autocorrelation.

Appendix B, which suggested that allowing for variation within response categories increases the
likelihood of being able to obtain a significant reversal.
Finally, note that B&L’s approach can in principle also be applied to the discrete interval model
for ℎ𝑟𝑖 discussed in Section 2.4. This can be done by estimating Equation (8) together with the
equation ln 𝜎𝑖 = 𝛼𝑠 + 𝛽𝑠 𝑋𝑖 + 𝜸𝒔 ′𝒁𝑖 by maximum likelihood (see, e.g., Gould, Pitblado, and Poi
2010). Such an application would rest on the assumption that 𝜀𝑟𝑖 = 𝜀𝑡𝑖 + 𝜂𝑖 in Equation (8) is
normally distributed (at given values of 𝑋𝑖 and 𝒁𝑖 ). This assumption is obviously incorrect because
it implies that error 𝜀𝑟𝑖 is continuous and unbounded whereas it actually is discrete and bounded
(at given 𝑋𝑖 and 𝒁𝑖 ).27
3.2

Comparison of models

The two most commonly used models in the happiness literature are the OLS discrete interval
model and the ordered probit model. Nowadays, the discrete interval model is more widely used
than the ordered probit model because it typically yields similar results but is much easier to
estimate and interpret. For the interval model, the sign reversal analysis given in Section 2.4 is
clearly more appropriate than the analysis summarized at the end of the previous section. An
important result of Section 2.4 is that a sign reversal of the effect of 𝑋𝑖 on ℎ𝑟𝑖 by relabelling the
scores of reported happiness is only possible if our relabelling condition is violated. As we will see
in Section 5 and in contrast to B&L’s approach, this condition is satisfied in many empirical
applications, implying that sign reversals are impossible in these cases. However, the ordered probit
model of B&L implies that transforming cardinal happiness scales by transforming the underlying
identifying model practically always allows for a sign reversal. This raises the question where this
difference in results comes from.
As explained in Section 3.1, B&L’s ordered probit model allows for variation of latent happiness
ℎ𝑙𝑖 with 𝑋𝑖 and 𝒁𝑖 within response categories, whereas our discrete interval model for ℎ𝑟𝑖 does
not. This implies that in B&L’s analysis, first-order stochastic dominance (FOSD) in cumulative
distribution functions of ℎ𝑙𝑖 of one group relative to another one is required to exclude sign
reversals (see B&L (2019), Section 2). Our approach only requires the weaker property of FOSD
in the cumulative response categories of ℎ𝑟𝑖 to rule out sign reversals (see Section 2.2). This is an
important difference because FOSD in cumulative distribution functions from the location-scale
family will never be satisfied in large samples (because variances across different groups are almost
never estimated to be exactly equal). In contrast, FOSD in cumulative response categories is
equivalent to the relabelling condition mentioned above, and hence holds in many empirical cases.
We can get a deeper understanding of the differences in approaches by considering the first line of
̃ 𝑖 more closely. An analogous expression applies to our
Equation (14) in B&L’s model for ℎ𝑙
̃𝑖 = 𝑒 𝑐ℎ𝑟𝑖 . Our
approach. Using a relabelling of the sort described in Section 2.3, we may obtain ℎ𝑟
When nevertheless carrying out such an estimation, we obtain estimates of -0.029 and -0.082 for the effects of
ln𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑝𝑐 on ℎ𝑟𝑖 and ln(𝜎𝑖 ), respectively. Applying condition (15) at the mean of ln𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑝𝑐 to these estimates and a
search procedure such as used in the HOP model above yields sign-reversing 𝑐 values of −1.77 and −1.61. These are
much more negative than what we found for the HOP model. Accordingly, 𝑐 = −1.61 implies a ratio 𝑟 = 𝑒 −1.61 =
̃𝑖 which is much smaller than the ratio 0.47 = 1⁄2.11 found in Table 1 and
0.20 of the multiplicative scale of ℎ𝑟
Section 2.4. This strong underestimation of the sign-reversing scale ratio is likely to be due to the misspecification of
the distribution of error 𝜀𝑟𝑖 in Equation (8) as normal.

approach thus implies a transformation of the linear model given by Equation (8) in Section 2.4.
̃𝑖 is directly linearly regressed on 𝑋𝑖 and
However, this transformation is not made explicit because ℎ𝑟
̃𝑖 = 𝛼̃ + 𝛽̃𝑋𝑖 + 𝛾̃𝒁𝑖 + 𝜀𝑟
𝒁𝑖 , i.e. we estimate ℎ𝑟
̃ 𝑖 . Error 𝜀𝑟
̃ 𝑖 in this regression is again discrete and

bounded at given values of 𝑋𝑖 and 𝒁𝑖 . In contrast, in B&L’s “indirect” approach, first 𝜇̃𝑖 ≡
̃ 𝑖 |𝑋𝑖 , 𝒁𝑖 ) is derived as given by Equation (15), and then, 𝜇̃𝑖 is linearly regressed on 𝑋𝑖 and 𝒁𝑖 .
𝐸(ℎ𝑙
The sign reversal condition for this regression is given by Equation (16). This condition can be
derived in an alternative way, which will give a deeper insight into the similarities and differences
between B&L’s and our approach. First, write the normally distributed error 𝜀𝑙𝑖 in Equation (13)
as 𝜎𝑖 𝜖𝑖 , where 𝜖𝑖 ~𝒩(0,1). The derivative 𝜕𝜇𝑖 ⁄𝜕𝑋𝑖 ≡ 𝜕𝐸(ℎ𝑙𝑖 |𝑋𝑖 , 𝒁𝑖 )⁄𝜕𝑋𝑖 in condition (16) can
then be rewritten as

Here 𝜑(𝜖𝑖 ) is the standard normal density function (2𝜋)−0.5 𝑒 −0.5𝜖𝑖 and ℎ𝑙𝑖 (𝜖𝑖 ) indicates that ℎ𝑙𝑖
is a function of the integration variable 𝜖𝑖 (besides 𝑋𝑖 and 𝒁𝑖 ). Thus, the (marginal) effect of 𝑋𝑖 on
mean happiness equals the mean effect of 𝑋𝑖 on individual happiness. Equation (13) and the
relation 𝜎𝑖 = 𝑒 ln𝜎𝑖 = 𝑒 𝛼𝑠 +𝛽𝑠 𝑋𝑖+𝜸𝒔′𝒁𝑖 imply that the “local” effect 𝜕ℎ𝑙𝑖 ⁄𝜕𝑋𝑖 of a unit change in 𝑋𝑖
on ℎ𝑙𝑖 for a given value of error 𝜖𝑖 equals 𝛽𝑙 + 𝛽𝑠 𝜎𝑖 𝜖𝑖 . The sign of this local effect depends on the
value of 𝜖𝑖 . For example, suppose that effect 𝛽𝑙 of 𝑋𝑖 on 𝜇𝑖 is positive and that the effect 𝛽𝑠 of 𝑋𝑖
on ln𝜎𝑖 is negative. Then the local effect of 𝑋𝑖 on ℎ𝑙𝑖 will be negative (i.e. 𝛽𝑙 + 𝛽𝑠 𝜎𝑖 𝜖𝑖 < 0) for a
sufficiently large value of 𝜖𝑖 . Clearly, this is the case when 𝜖𝑖 > − 𝛽𝑙 ⁄(𝛽𝑠 𝜎𝑖 ) > 0. This implies that
the sign of the local effect of 𝑋𝑖 on ℎ𝑙𝑖 is heterogeneous across the distribution of 𝜖𝑖 , and hence
of ℎ𝑙𝑖 . In Section 2.2 such heterogeneity has been shown to represent the fundamental cause of
the possibility of a sign reversal of the effect of an explanatory variable 𝑋𝑖 on mean happiness.
For untransformed ℎ𝑙𝑖 , Equation (18) implies that the resulting overall mean effect of 𝑋𝑖 on ℎ𝑙𝑖
equals 𝛽𝑙 + 𝛽𝑠 𝜎𝑖 𝐸(𝜖𝑖 |𝑋𝑖 , 𝒁𝑖 ) = 𝛽𝑙 , and hence is positive in the present example. However, for a
̃ 𝑖 = 𝑒 𝑐ℎ𝑙𝑖 , the sign of the mean effect of 𝑋𝑖 on ℎ𝑙
̃ 𝑖 may be
sufficiently strong transformation ℎ𝑙
different. This effect again equals the effect of 𝑋𝑖 on transformed mean happiness 𝜇̃, and it can be
expressed as an integral over local effects on 𝜇̃𝑖 . To see this, differentiate the first line of Equation
(14) with respect to 𝑋𝑖 and integrate the resulting expression over the standard normal distribution
as

29 This uses the mathematical property that the derivative of the integral with respect to 𝑋 in the second term of this

on 𝑋𝑖 .
17
28

The integrand in this equation again changes sign beyond 𝜖𝑖 = − 𝛽𝑙 ⁄(𝛽𝑠 𝜎𝑖 ). However, now the
̃ 𝑖 are
weights 𝑒 𝑐𝜎𝑖 𝜖𝑖 𝜑(𝜖𝑖 ) of the local effects 𝛽𝑙 + 𝛽𝑠 𝜎𝑖 𝜖𝑖 in the overall mean effect of 𝑋𝑖 on ℎ𝑙
relatively higher for large positive (𝑐 > 0) or large negative (𝑐 < 0) values of 𝜖𝑖 as compared to the
weights 𝜑(𝜖𝑖 ) in the integrand in Equation (18). Hence, in the above example for 𝛽𝑙 > 0 and
𝛽𝑠 < 0, the negative local effects for 𝜖𝑖 > − 𝛽𝑙 ⁄(𝛽𝑠 𝜎𝑖 ) > 0 in the right half of the standard normal
distribution get higher weights for 𝑐 > 0. These weights increase in 𝑐, implying that for sufficiently
large 𝑐 the negative local effects will start to dominate the positive local effects in making the overall
̃ 𝑖 , and hence the effect of 𝑋𝑖 on 𝜇̃, negative. The value of 𝑐 beyond which
mean effect of 𝑋𝑖 on ℎ𝑙
this will occur, is predicted by a reversal condition that follows from integrating the integral in
Equation (19) by parts. Appendix C shows that this condition turns out to be condition (16).
Thus, just as relabelling condition (11) in our approach, reversal condition (16) in B&L’s approach
turns out to be essentially based on heterogeneity in the sign of the local effects of 𝑋𝑖 on individual
happiness. Note that in this case the heterogeneity is implied by heteroscedasticity of error 𝜀𝑙𝑖 in
Equation (13).30
However, why is a sign reversal always possible in B&L’s approach, but not so in our approach?
On the one hand, in B&L’s model the standard normal density function 𝜑(𝜖𝑖 ) of error 𝜖𝑖 is
unbounded. Therefore, even if ratio − 𝛽𝑙 ⁄(𝛽𝑠 𝜎𝑖 ) beyond which the local effect of 𝑋𝑖 on ℎ𝑙𝑖
changes sign is very large positive or negative, there will always exist sufficiently extreme values of
𝜖𝑖 in a tail of its distribution for which the local effect of 𝑋𝑖 on ℎ𝑙𝑖 has a different sign. On the
other hand, in our model (8) for reported happiness ℎ𝑟𝑖 the distribution of error 𝜀𝑟𝑖 at given values
of 𝑋𝑖 and 𝒁𝑖 is inherently bounded. Hence, if ratio − 𝛽𝑙 ⁄(𝛽𝑠 𝜎𝑖 ) is very large positive or negative,
there will not always exist sufficiently extreme values of 𝜖𝑖 in one of the tails of the distribution of
𝜀𝑟𝑖 for which the local effect of 𝑋𝑖 on ℎ𝑟𝑖 switches sign.31
A key issue in judging whether B&L’s approach or our approach is more appropriate in evaluating
whether sign reversals are possible, is whether the underlying scale of true happiness ℎ𝑡𝑖 is bounded
or not. Introspection does not give us a clear answer to this question. On the one hand, there may
be upper and lower limits to one’s happiness as expressed by the labels “completely happy” and
“completely unhappy”. On the other hand, for every happiness level one can imagine, one may be
able to imagine another happiness level at which one is even happier or even less happy. However,
in practice the scale of ℎ𝑡𝑖 is bounded by limited variation in human biology and finite numbers of
people in populations.
A more empirically minded argument in favour of our approach is the following. Consider a
situation in which all empirically observed cumulative response shares move in the same direction
when an explanatory variable 𝑋𝑖 rises (or falls). Our relabelling condition is then satisfied and sign
reversals are not possible in our model. But in B&L’s model they still are. The analysis above
This is because heterogeneity of local effects of 𝑋𝑖 on ℎ𝑙𝑖 is equivalent to a conditional expectation function
𝐸(ℎ𝑙𝑖 |𝑋𝑖 , 𝒁𝑖 ) that is nonlinear in 𝑋𝑖 (cf. footnote 14). Hence, if one uses a linear regression model to approximate
such a nonlinear conditional expectation function, it reveals itself as heteroscedasticity of error 𝜀𝑙𝑖 (see Angrist and
Pischke, 2009, p. 46).
31 Strictly speaking, this argument presumes that we approximate the discrete distribution of 𝜀𝑟 at given 𝑋 and 𝒁 by
𝑖
𝑖
𝑖
a continuous but bounded underlying distribution of true happiness ℎ𝑡𝑖 (e.g., ranging from 0.5 to 𝑅 + 0.5 for the
usual rank-order scale (1, … , 𝑅) of ℎ𝑟𝑖 ).
18
30

showed that such sign reversals are then made possible by sign reversals of local effects of 𝑋𝑖 on
individual happiness in an extreme tail of its distribution. However, such sign reversals of local
effects are not empirically observed, and hence there is no clear indication in the data that they
occur. Therefore, in such situations the possibility of sign reversals of the overall effect of 𝑋𝑖 on
mean happiness is speculative from an empirical point of view.

Plausibility of multiplicative happiness scales

In this section, we briefly illustrate what transformations of the happiness scale imply about a
researcher’s substantive assumptions about respondents’ scale use. We then review some
experimental evidence which suggests that scale use is roughly linear for response scales with many
categories.
4.1

General and theoretical arguments

When we transform a rank-order scale of reported happiness ℎ𝑟 (or a similar scale of latent
̃ (or similar scale ℎ𝑙
̃ ) and take
happiness ℎ𝑙 in the ordered probit case) into a multiplicative scale ℎ𝑟
such a scale to be a better proxy for ℎ𝑡, we also change our substantive beliefs about the way in
which persons reply to happiness questions. When ℎ𝑟 is rank-order coded we believe that the
difference in mean ℎ𝑡 between each pair of adjacent response categories is constant. When we
transform this scale, these differences are no longer constant. Instead, when using the
̃ grows or declines
transformations discussed above, the difference in mean ℎ𝑡 between levels of ℎ𝑟
by a multiplicative factor 𝑟 which is larger or smaller than one, respectively (see Section 2.3). For
response scales with just three categories this may not be too problematic. For instance, in order
to just reverse the effect of per capita GDP in the Easterlin Paradox example in Sections 2.1 and
3.1, we only require a value of 𝑟 = 𝑒 −0.75 = 0.47 in our direct approach and a similar ratio
𝑒 −0.67 = 0.51 in B&L’s HOP model. These ratios imply that a jump in true happiness intensity
from the 2nd to the 3rd response category is roughly half as big as a jump from the 1st to the 2nd
response category. It seems possible that respondents use the response scale in this manner.
However, this plausibility problem becomes more severe when the number of response categories
grows large. For instance, the question on life satisfaction in the oft-used German SOEP survey
has 11 response categories. When for example applying an exponential transformation 𝑒 𝑐ℎ𝑟 with
𝑐 = 1 (which is smaller than the just-sign-reversing 𝑐’s in most of our relevant results in Section
5.2), the difference in ℎ𝑡 between ℎ𝑟 = 0 (the lowest coding) and ℎ𝑟 = 1 becomes 1.72. However,
the difference between ℎ𝑟 = 9 and ℎ𝑟 = 10 becomes 13,923.38, which is more than 8,000 times
̃ as an
larger.32 Thus, when applying such a transformation and treating our transformed variable ℎ𝑟
equally plausible proxy of ℎ𝑡, we say that the following two ways of responding to a happiness
question are equally plausible:

32

𝑒 1 − 𝑒 0 = 1.72 and 𝑒 10 − 𝑒 9 = 13923.38.
19

1. Respondents interpret each difference between subsequent steps on their response scale as
covering equal distances33 on their scale of experienced ℎ𝑡. This may be illustrated as:

Figure 1. Linear response scale with equal intervals.

2. Respondents interpret each difference between subsequent steps on their response scale as
covering a distance on their experienced scale of ℎ𝑡 that is larger by a constant multiplicative
factor 𝑟 = 𝑒 𝑐 . This behavior is illustrated below for 𝑟 = 𝑒 1 = 2.72:

Figure 2. Multiplicative response scale with exponentially increasing intervals (𝑟 = 𝑒1 = 2.72).

From introspection, it appears to us that the former interpretation is closer to our way of answering
happiness questions. However, we may not be representative.
A more general, theoretical argument in favour of a linear response scale as illustrated by Figure 1
is provided by Van Praag (1971). Respondents may think of a finite set of response categories as
discretizing an underlying continuous quantity (like true happiness). When reasoning about how to
use such a set of categories to discretize that quantity, respondents may attempt to maximize the
information that they give in the questionnaire. They can do so by minimizing the expected
“inaccuracy” of their answer34, as modelled with a cost function like the square of the prediction
error (i.e. the expectation of the square of the difference between what a respondent feels and what
a researcher infers from that answer). Van Praag shows that if respondents believe the underlying
quantity to be uniformly distributed, discretizing this quantity into equally spaced intervals
minimizes this cost function. Kapteyn (1977) generalizes this result to hold for any plausible cost
function.
4.2

Experimental evidence of approximately linear response scales

As a first piece of experimental evidence, Van Praag (1991) tested how persons translate ordered
verbal labels (very bad; bad; not bad; not good; good; very good) into cardinal quantities in a context-free
setting. In a first experiment he asked subjects to assign numbers between 1 and 1000 to each
verbal label. Here, 1 was said to stand for the “very worst” and 1000 for the “very best”. In a
second experiment, respondents were asked to produce lines of certain length corresponding to
each verbal label. Here a length of 1 unit was said to stand for the “worst”, and a length of 40 to

Depending on whether one views the scale of ℎ𝑡 as bounded or not, the top and bottom categories are exempted
from that.
34 See Bless, Strack, and Schwarz (1993) for arguments in favour of that assumption, and Van Praag (1991) and Parducci
(1995) for related efficiency arguments.

stand for the “best”. No further context was given in either experiment. Scaling both sets of
responses to lie on the interval [0,1], Van Praag’s results were as follows:

Note: Confidence intervals are computed using a student’s t-distribution with sample standard deviations given on
p. 78 of van Praag (1991) and N = 361.

Both experiments suggest roughly linear scale use. Although there is some variation in intervals
between verbal labels, there is no obvious pattern to it. At most, it appears that labels “very bad”
and “bad” are less strongly distinguished than all the other labels. Van Praag explains this by noting
that respondents may be trying to “leave room” for values associated with the other more positive
labels.
As more direct evidence, Studer (2012) analyses Dutch data in which respondents were asked to
report their happiness with a slider on a continuous and bounded scale.35 Using such a scale,
respondents are enabled to report their ℎ𝑡 more directly. This makes it more plausible to assume
that values obtained from such a slider can be interpreted cardinally. Fortunately, respondents were
also asked to report their happiness on a Likert scale with ten response options (ranging from 0 to
9).36 Studer can therefore compare response behaviour from a question that may plausibly be
assumed to measure ℎ𝑡 cardinally (up to a linear transformation), with a question that measures ℎ𝑟
in a manner that is common in happiness research. In doing so, he evaluates which partitioning of
the continuous scale would reproduce the observed response shares on the discrete Likert scale.
More formally, he finds the set of cutoffs 𝜏𝑘 , 𝑘 = 0, … , 10, that satisfy 𝜏0 = 0 and 𝐹𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡. (𝜏𝑘 ) =
∑𝑘−1
𝑙=0 𝑠𝑙 , where 𝐹𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡. is the empirical CDF of responses for the question using the continuous
slider and 𝑠𝑙 denotes the share of respondents that report response category 𝑙 on the question using
the Likert scale (as in Section 2.4). He finds that differences between cutoffs do not form a regular
pattern: they are neither equidistant nor do they follow a multiplicatively increasing or decreasing
scale. However, ratios of almost all subsequent differences of cutoffs do not exceed 1.8 or fall
below 0.4.37 Studer’s results therefore suggest that scales with multiplicative factors 𝑟 < 0.4 and
𝑟 > 1.8, corresponding to 𝑐 < −0.92 and 𝑐 > 0.59 are not plausible for Likert scales with
relatively many response categories.

The boundedness of the scale may be justified by assuming that happiness, as argued in Section 3.2, is bounded
between states of being completely happy (or satisfied) and being completely unhappy (or dissatisfied).
36 In both cases, the original question reads “Alles bij elkaar genomen, hoe gelukkig zou u zeggen dat u bent?” (Taking
all things together, how happy would you say you are?), with extremes labelled “helemaal ongelukkig” (completely
unhappy) and “helemaal gelukkig” (completely happy).
37 The only exceptions are the ratios (𝜏 − 𝜏 )⁄(𝜏 − 𝜏 ) and (𝜏 − 𝜏 )⁄(𝜏 − 𝜏 ). These ratios are more extreme

since very few people responded with the lowest two categories on the Likert scale. In other words, Studer (2012) finds
that 0.4 ≤ (𝜏𝑘 − 𝜏𝑘−1 )⁄(𝜏𝑘−1 − 𝜏𝑘−2 ) < 1.8 ∀ 𝑘 ∈ 4. . . ,9. Unfortunately, Studer (2012) only provides a graphical
figure and not precise cutoff values. These are therefore estimates.
21
35

An additional argument in favour of a linear response scale can be derived from experimental
results in psychophysics. Because this argument is rather complicated, we relegate it to Appendix
D. Thus, we have suggestive evidence from various experiments and theoretical perspectives that
all point in a similar direction: People plausibly use roughly linear response scales.38
4.3

Scales with few response categories may be multiplicative

However, it is possible that the preceding arguments only hold in cases with at least five response
categories (which is the number of categories used in van Praag’s experiments). The happiness
variables that are mostly analysed by B&L have just three or four response categories. We may
think that respondents use these scales as collapsed versions of scales with more categories. If so,
multiplicative scale use may be plausible in such cases. We therefore perform an exercise similar to
that of Studer (2012).
Table 3 lists cumulative shares in each response category from the happiness question of the 2006
wave of the US General Social Survey (GSS; with three categories), as well as cumulative shares for
a life satisfaction question from the 5th (2006) wave of the United States sample in the World Values
survey (WVS).39 Both samples are representative of the same population and the two questions
measure strongly correlated concepts of ℎ𝑡.

The observed cumulative response shares in these samples suggest that category “not too happy”
in the GSS questions most closely corresponds to categories 1-5 on a 10-points scale. Likewise,
category “pretty happy” seems most likely to correspond to categories 6-8 and category “very
happy” corresponds to categories 9-10 on a 10-points scale. Assume now that the relative
distribution of responses across the 10-points scale in the WVS sample (measuring life satisfaction)
is a reasonable approximation of the distribution of responses we would observe had the GSS
sample (measuring happiness) been given a 10-points scale. Assuming that the 10-points scale
measures ℎ𝑡 roughly cardinally (as argued in the previous section), we can then take mean ℎ𝑟 across
Another suggestive piece of evidence in favour of linearity comes from Oswald (2008). He shows that when people
are asked to rate their own height on a bounded scale, they treat that scale as linear. This is shown by regressing
responses on the bounded scale against true height and the square of true height. While the coefficient on the squared
terms for true height is negative, its magnitude is rather small, implying a negligible degree of concavity in the response
scale. However, this result may be particular to heights. Other quantities may be rated in a non-linear manner. For
example, subjective loudness of a sound is recorded on a logarithmic decibel scale of its physical intensity.
39 Unfortunately, we are not aware of a publicly available dataset that has a 10-points or 11-points scale for a question
on happiness in the United States.

categories 1-5 of the WVS variable as indicative of mean ℎ𝑡 in the “not too happy” response
category of the GSS variable. This yields a mean of 4.14. Same arguments apply to mean ℎ𝑟 of
categories 6-8 (mean = 7.30) and 9-10 (mean = 9.28) of WVS as being indicative of mean ℎ𝑡 in
categories “pretty happy” and “very happy” of GSS. These (assumed) differences in ℎ𝑡 between
response categories of the GSS variable become smaller by a ratio of
(9.28 − 7.30)⁄(7.30 − 4.14) = 0.62.40
To just reverse the effect of per capita GDP in B&L’s EP example, we required a ratio of 0.47
when using our direct method and a ratio of 0.51 when using B&L’s method. Since these are not
much more extreme than the ratio 0.62 just obtained, reversals for the EP example may be
plausible. However, in order to obtain a reversal which is significant at the 5% level, we require a
ratio of 𝑒 −4.34 = 0.01 when using B&Ls method (for our method no such scale exists). Such a
scale seems very implausible given the discussion in the previous section.
Furthermore, using WVS (4-points scale for happiness) and ESS (11-points scale for happiness)
data, we also applied a similar procedure to a set of 14 European countries. That exercise yielded
that differences between responses on the 4-point WVS scale collapse in a roughly linear manner
onto the 11-point ESS scale. See Table A1 of Appendix E for results.41 It therefore appears that
convex/concave scales of the degree B&L require (see, e.g., Section A3.4) may be plausible for
questions with three response options, but less so for questions with more response options.
Finally, B&L (in Sections 3 and A1.3) argue that it is plausible that the distribution of (true)
happiness is more skewed than that of wealth and comparable to that of income. B&L use this in
their empirical examples to make a case for the plausibility of the strongly non-linear happiness
scales that they require (strongly skewed happiness distributions imply strongly non-linear scales,
see Section 3.1). However, their argument is strange in view of empirical evidence of diminishing
marginal happiness from income (Vendrik and Woltjer, 2007; Layard et al., 2008). This evidence
implies that, if anything, the distribution of happiness (at given values of the explanatory variables)
is considerably less right-skewed than the distribution of income or may even be left-skewed. In
fact, the left-skewedness of the distribution of the continuous happiness variable in Fig. 4 of Studer
(2012) strongly suggests that the distribution of true happiness may be left-skewed as well. This
may also hold when we condition that distribution on a set of control variables because relatively
little variation in happiness is typically explained by such controls.42 However, we do not know of
any argument why the degree of left-skewedness of such a distribution should be comparable to
the degree of right-skewedness of the income or wealth distribution.

The matching of GSS happiness shares and WVS life satisfaction shares in Table 3 takes into account that people
tend to be happier than they are satisfied with their life (see e.g. Knabe et al. 2010). This is confirmed by a comparison
of shares of happiness and life satisfaction scores on 11-points scales in wave 3 (2006) of the ESS (see Table A1 in the
Appendix).
41 The figures for mean ℎ𝑟 after collapse in the fifth column of Table A1 imply adjacent happiness differences from
“not at all happy” to “very happy” of 2.71, 3.56, and 2.64. The subsequent ratios of these differences are given by 1.31
and 0.74. The corresponding c values of 0.27 and -0.30 are much smaller in size than the c values of 1.72 and -1.72 in
Table A-3 of B&L between which country rankings in mean happiness reverse.
42 An important exception are individual fixed effects as used in our empirical application in Section 5, but these are
not included in the empirical examples of B&L (2019). Moreover, B&L use few control variables in most of these
examples.

Empirical Applications

5.1

Adding control variables and using scales with many response categories

In Section 2.2 we speculated that the likelihood of reversals can be reduced by adding relevant
controls, which may reduce the heterogeneity in the effect of ln𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑝𝑐 across the distribution of
reported happiness. In the context of the Easterlin Paradox, a particularly salient control is a linear
time trend that picks up secular trends in other determinants of mean happiness than ln𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑝𝑐 (see
Kaiser & Vendrik, 2019). In Table A2 of Appendix E, we thus extend Table 1 by adding a linear
time trend to the estimation equations. This causes the effect of ln𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑝𝑐 on the share of those
responding “very happy” to become positive while the effect on the share of those “not too happy”
remains negative, and the effect on those responding with “rather happy” remains positive.
Consequently, the effect of ln𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑝𝑐 on mean rank-order-coded ℎ𝑟 becomes significantly positive
(while the coefficient of year is significantly negative). The Easterlin Paradox is therefore rejected
in this case, and no transformation of ℎ𝑟 could reverse this sign of the effect of ln𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑝𝑐.43
We now turn to assessing the wider empirical relevance of the points of the preceding sections. We
do so by evaluating the possibility and plausibility of reversals for a range of important demographic
variables using waves 1 (1984) to 32 (2015) of the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP). The
SOEP is a nationally representative survey of the German population and is among the most
commonly used dataset in empirical work on happiness. Our explanatory variables of interest are
household income, unemployment, marriage, having children, and self-reported disability. These
variables are similar to those investigated in the empirical appendix of Bond and Lang.44 Answers
to the question “How satisfied are you with your life, all things considered”45, with 11 response categories
labelled from 0 to 10 are used as our dependent variable ℎ𝑟𝑖 . Bond and Lang’s analyses rely on
questions with only three to seven response categories. Since 10 or 11 response categories are more
typical for most happiness research, it will be useful to study whether plausible reversals can be
obtained with the present variables. Moreover, the effects of income and unemployment have been
extensively studied with these data. Consequently, there is now near universal agreement that, at
least in the short run, higher incomes improve life satisfaction while unemployment reduces it. It
would be a disturbing finding if these results were easily reversed.

Adding further controls like ln(individual household income), unemployment status, the square of ln𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑝𝑐, and
its interaction with ln(individual household income) or unemployment status does not change this result, although the
effects of ln(individual household income), unemployment status, and their interactions with ln𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑝𝑐 on mean rankorder ℎ𝑟 are significant. However, the positive coefficient of ln𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑝𝑐 is likely to pick up business cycle effects which
should be controlled for in a proper test of the Easterlin Paradox (see Kaiser and Vendrik, 2019 for details).
44 In their Appendix A.3.3, they consider the effects of the unemployment rate and inflation rate on happiness using
Eurobarometer data. Unfortunately, they do not report which level of 𝑐 would (just) reverse the sign of the effect of
unemployment. In Section A.3.6, they consider the effect of being married and of having children using BHPS data.
They find that a right-skewed transformation with 𝑐 = 0.32 reverses the effect of being married for men, while a leftskewed transformation with 𝑐 = −2.69 reverses the effect of being married for women. Left-skewed transformations
with 𝑐 = −0.74 and 𝑐 = −0.64 reverse the effect of children in the household for men and women, respectively.
Also using BHPS data, in Section A.3.8 Bond and Lang show that a right-skewed transformation with 𝑐 = 1.41 would
reverse the effect of disability. None of their analyses except that of the effects of unemployment and inflation include
control variables.

For income we use log net (post-tax) household incomes, deflated to 2005 prices. We equivalize
incomes using the modified OECD scale.46 Regarding unemployment, we code a dummy that is 1
when a person reports to be unemployed, and 0 for any other possible employment status. We
code similar dummies for being married, living with children in the household, and reporting a
disability. Next to reporting results in which these variables are entered separately, we also report
results in which all variables are entered jointly along with a set of additional control variables. The
additional control variables include region (“Bundesländer”) dummies, wave dummies, age, age
squared, a tertiary education dummy, a home ownership dummy, log household size and log
working hours.47 We restrict our sample to those above the age of 18. In total, our sample includes
557,999 observations. We first present results for our method using relabelling, and then turn to
Bond & Lang’s method.
5.2

Reversals using relabelling

Ferrer-i-Carbonell & Frijters (2004) made evident that time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity driven by e.g. individual personality traits (Boyce, 2010) - causes considerable bias in pooledregression estimates. Applied researchers have consequently turned to individual-fixed-effects
models to account for this unobserved heterogeneity. Unfortunately, fixed-effects estimators are
not easily available for the ordered probit model. This is a drawback to Bond & Lang’s method. 48
However, by demeaning each regression of ℎ𝑑𝑘,𝑖𝑡 (index 𝑡 runs over time periods) our relabelling
condition can be straightforwardly applied to the fixed-effects model.49
Thus, Table 4 shows results for pooled and fixed-effects regressions of ℎ𝑟𝑖𝑡 on each of our
explanatory variables of interest. Columns (1) and (3) show results from separate regressions in
which each variable is entered individually (being married and having children are always entered
jointly), while columns (2) and (4) show results from regressions in which all variables of interest,
along with the additional controls discussed above, are entered jointly.50
In all specifications, household income and being married are associated with higher life
satisfaction, while unemployment and reporting a disability are associated with lower life
satisfaction. Having children in the household is also associated with higher satisfaction but turns
insignificant when including fixed effects as well as controls. More generally, accounting for fixed
effects reduces the size of coefficient estimates for every explanatory variable.
In order to evaluate whether the sign of these coefficients can be reversed, we estimate regressions
of ℎ𝑑𝑘,𝑖𝑡 for 𝑘 = 0,1, … ,9 when entering variables separately, when including controls, and when
either running pooled regressions or when controlling for fixed effects. Tables A3 and A4 in
We exclude respondents in the top and bottom percentiles of the income distribution as well as the self-employed,
since there may be substantial measurement error in these observations (Berthoud and Bryan 2011; Hurst, Li, and
Pugsley 2013).
47 Entered as log(1+working hours) to allow for observations with zero working hours.
48 A similar drawback is faced in Schröder & Yitzhaki’s (2017) approach since their reversal condition does not allow
for controls. See, however, Ferrer-i-Carbonell & Frijters (2004), Section 4, for an ordered logit model with individualfixed effects, and Van Praag (2015) for a discussion of how accounting for fixed effects may be possible in an ordered
probit context.
49 In this case, with full controls, linear age drops out of the estimations since it is then perfectly collinear with the
individual-fixed effects and the wave dummies.
50 Since one may worry that marriage and having children mediate the effect of income, we also ran regressions in
which these variables are excluded. This yielded very similar results for all other variables.

Appendix E show our full results. To illustrate, Figure 3 plots estimated coefficients of household
income for each regression of ℎ𝑑𝑘,𝑖𝑡 (see Figures A1 to A4 in Appendix F for such plots for
unemployed, married, having children and disability). Recall that our relabelling condition states
that coefficient sign reversals are impossible if and only if all coefficient estimates on ℎ𝑑𝑘,𝑖𝑡 have
the same sign for all 𝑘.

Reversing 𝑐 values have been obtained numerically.

Figure 3. Coefficient estimates of income for each regression of ℎ𝑑𝑘,𝑖𝑡 , corresponding to Appendix Tables A3
and A4.

For our pooled regressions, we find that the income coefficient can be reversed when no controls
are included. Since the sign of the effect on ℎ𝑑9,𝑖𝑡 is positive, while all others are negative, a
sufficiently convex transformation can achieve such a reversal. A numerical search reveals that a
multiplicative scale in which spaces between adjacent response categories grow by a ratio of 24.1
is required to just achieve such a reversal. This corresponds to a level of 𝑐 = ln(24.1) = 3.18 in
̃𝑖𝑡 = 𝑒 𝑐ℎ𝑟𝑖𝑡 . Second, the effect of having children can be reversed when
the transformation ℎ𝑟
26

including controls. Here, since the sign of the effect on ℎ𝑑0,𝑖𝑡 is positive while the effects in all
other regressions of ℎ𝑑𝑘,𝑖𝑡 are negative, a sufficiently concave transformation can achieve such a
̃𝑖𝑡 = −𝑒 𝑐ℎ𝑟𝑖𝑡 with 𝑐 = −2.83 or lower
reversal. A numerical search yields that a transformation ℎ𝑟
is sufficient. Given the results of Table 4, these pooled estimates are likely biased due to the
omission of fixed effects. Nevertheless, when accounting for fixed effects, reversals remain
possible for both income (without controls, convex, with 𝑐 = 1.44 or higher) and for children
(now convex with 𝑐 = 0.13 or higher).51 In addition, the effects of being married (without controls)
and disability (with controls) can now be reversed by respective convex transformations with at
least 𝑐 = 2.17 and 𝑐 = 2.53.
The effect of unemployment cannot be reversed in any specification. We may thus conclude that
the common finding that unemployment is associated with lower life satisfaction is particularly
robust. Should any of the other reversals worry us? In light of the arguments given in in Section 4,
scales with 𝑐 values in the order of at least 1 (𝑟 ≥ 𝑒 1 = 2.72) or at most -1 (𝑟 ≤ 𝑒 −1 = 0.37) are
implausible. Almost all just-sign-reversing scales found above fall within these ranges. The only
exception is the reversal scale for 𝑐 = 0.13, implying 𝑟 = 𝑒 0.13 = 1.14. This scale is reasonably
close to a linear scale. We thus conclude that while reversals are possible for most variables in at least
some specifications, the only plausible reversal is that of the effect of having children in a fixedeffects regression with controls. Since that result was strongly insignificant and close to zero in
Table 4, this is not a particularly striking result.52
5.3

Bounds on trade-off ratios

However, Figures 3 and A1-A4 indicate that the relative magnitudes of the effects of each
explanatory variable on ℎ𝑑𝑘,𝑖𝑡 are not the same for all 𝑘. Given the discussion in Section 2.5, tradeoff ratios of coefficients will consequently not be invariant under all transformations of ℎ𝑟𝑖𝑡 .
Section 2.5 also established that ratios of coefficients will be bounded from above and below by
the largest and smallest corresponding ratios obtained from regressions of ℎ𝑑𝑘,𝑖𝑡 . Figure 4 plots
the ratio of the coefficients of unemployment, being married, having children and disability against
the coefficient for income in each of the fixed effects regressions of ℎ𝑑𝑘,𝑖𝑡 (with full controls;
corresponding to the bottom panel of Table A4).
Since the magnitudes of the coefficients of being married and having children are small, their ratios
with the coefficients of income vary only little across regressions of ℎ𝑑𝑘,𝑖𝑡 . Moreover, since the
coefficients of having children switch sign for 𝑘 ≥ 7, the ratios of these coefficients with those of
income then change sign, too. For unemployment and disability, we observe that the ratios of these
coefficients to the income coefficient generally increase with higher 𝑘. Therefore, the ratios of the
effects of unemployment and disability on ℎ𝑟𝑖𝑡 to the effect of income on ℎ𝑟𝑖𝑡 will also increase
(decrease) for increasingly convex (concave) transformations of ℎ𝑟𝑖𝑡 .53

Similar to our findings for the Easterlin Paradox in which the addition of a linear time trend made reversals
impossible (see section 5.1), further robustness regressions not shown here indicate that the inclusion of wave dummies
is sufficient to make reversals of the sign of the coefficient of log household income impossible.
52 Moreover, to achieve a significantly negative effect estimate with 𝑝 < 0.05 of children we require 𝑐 = 0.65, implying
𝑟 = 𝑒 0.65 = 1.92.
53 Recall that convex (concave) transformations give relatively more weight to changes at higher (lower) levels of ℎ𝑟 .

regression of ℎ𝑑𝑘,𝑖𝑡 . Regressions include the full set of controls and account for fixed effects (corresponding
to the bottom panel of Table A4).

Using such ratios of coefficients, we can calculate the shadow price of each explanatory variable.
We define the shadow price of e.g. unemployment as the amount of additional income needed for
an unemployed person with a particular income level 𝑦 to be as satisfied as someone who is not
unemployed. This amount is given by (𝑒 −𝛽𝑢𝑒⁄𝛽𝑙𝑛𝑦 − 1)𝑦.54 Here, 𝛽𝑙𝑛𝑦 is the coefficient of log
household income, and 𝛽𝑢𝑒 is the coefficient of unemployment. Consequently, the shadow price
of unemployment will fall in a range determined by the largest and smallest ratio of coefficients
obtained from regressions of ℎ𝑑𝑘,𝑖𝑡 . Ranges of shadow prices for being married, having children,
and disability can be found analogously. In Table 5, we list ranges of shadow cost for each
independent variable as evaluated at the mean of income.

Negative shadow prices imply that a variable is estimated to benefit respondents. Thus, at the sample mean of
household income and when using rank-order ℎ𝑟𝑖𝑡 , a person who is not married needs to be compensated with
€8,278€ of additional household income in order to be as satisfied as a person who is married.
54

To see this, solve [𝛽𝑙𝑛𝑦 ln(𝑦 + ∆𝑦) + 𝛽𝑢𝑒 ] − 𝛽𝑙𝑛𝑦 ln (𝑦) = 0 for ∆𝑦.
28

As expected on the basis of Figure 4, we find that the ranges of estimated shadow prices of
unemployment and disability cover an extremely wide range. In contrast, shadow prices for
marriage and children are comparatively small and vary little.55 However, these ranges of possible
shadow prices rely on rather implausible transformations of ℎ𝑟𝑖𝑡 in which differences between
response categories approach zero except for some particular chosen response category (cf. Section
̃𝑖𝑡 = ±𝑒 𝑐ℎ𝑟𝑖𝑡 ,
2.5). We therefore also evaluate how shadow prices change for a transformation ℎ𝑟
with 𝑐 = 0.4 and 𝑐 = −0.4. These levels of 𝑐 imply that differences in life satisfaction intensity
between adjacent response categories increase or decrease by a factor of 𝑒 0.4 ≈ 1.5. We take it that
such transformations may still be plausible.56 This exercise shows that shadow prices for
unemployment and disability still cover a rather wide range. Indeed, based on these figures, we do
not know whether an unemployed (disabled) person can be compensated with as little as €93,000
(€22,000) or requires as much as €274,000 (€53,000).
We thus conclude that although sign reversals of the effects of explanatory variables on life
satisfaction tend to be either impossible or very implausible, ratios of coefficients are heavily
affected under even reasonably mild transformations. We therefore recommend that future
empirical work should verify the robustness of its key results against mild convex and concave
transformations of ℎ𝑟𝑖𝑡 . We would also welcome for future work to at least check whether sign
reversals of key coefficients are possible, and if so, to assess whether the required scale
transformations seem plausible.
5.4

Reversals using Bond and Lang’s method

We now turn to applying Bond and Lang’s method to achieve reversals as discussed in Section 3.1.
To do so, in Table 6 we report results from ordered probit regressions on the same data as in Table
4. We again observe that higher incomes, being married, and having children are always associated
with higher (mean) life satisfaction while unemployment and disability are associated with lower
satisfaction. The magnitudes of these coefficients are roughly twice those obtained in the pooled
OLS results of Table 4. This is because differences between cutoffs are estimated to be somewhat
above 2 for high levels of ℎ𝑟𝑖𝑡 and somewhat below 2 for low levels of ℎ𝑟𝑖𝑡 . Coefficients are
therefore scaled by a factor of approximately 2 when compared to the rank-order coding used in
Table 4. Concerning the estimated standard deviation in latent satisfaction, 𝜎𝑖𝑡 we find the opposite
result: higher incomes, being married and having children reduce 𝜎𝑖𝑡 , while unemployment and
disability increase 𝜎𝑖𝑡 . Since no coefficient on ln(𝜎𝑖𝑡 ) is estimated to be precisely zero, reversals
are possible for every variable.57 Because every explanatory variable has different coefficient signs
for 𝜇𝑖𝑡 as compared to ln(𝜎𝑖𝑡 ), convex transformations with positive 𝑐 will yield reversals.

Note that since sign reversals were possible for children and disability, the signs of their shadow prices also depend
on the chosen scale.
56 The arguments of Section 4 only establish that extreme departures from linearity are not plausible. They do not
establish exactly when departures from linearity become implausible, which is why these choices for 𝑐 are of course
somewhat arbitrary.
57 However, the coefficient of children in the specification with full controls is insignificant and very close to zero. In
turn, this small coefficient led to the extremely large estimate of the required value for 𝑐 in Table 7.

Strikingly, the numerical 𝑐 values given in Table 7 show that reversals are not generally made harder
with additional controls. Thus, in contrast with the Easterlin Paradox case in Section 5.1, adding
such controls does not seem to reduce heterogeneities in the effects of unemployment and married
status across the distribution of ℎ𝑟𝑖𝑡 . However, adding controls does reduce heterogeneities in the
effects of log HH income, children, and disability.

Finally, in order to give a correct interpretation of how extreme the transformed happiness scales

2 for the majority of our sample (more than 75% of the sample report a happiness score above 4).
30

̃ 𝑖𝑡 = 𝑒 𝑐ℎ𝑙𝑖𝑡 is typically more than twice as extreme
Therefore, for any given 𝑐, a transformation ℎ𝑙
as a similar transformation of rank-order coded ℎ𝑟𝑖𝑡 . Hence, for a proper comparison with the
latter transformations, we should multiply the 𝑐 values in Table 7 by at least 2. After this
multiplication, it turns out that no numerical 𝑐 value is below our benchmark of 𝑐 = 1 from Section
4.1. The closest to this benchmark is the value required to just reverse the effect of being married
with full controls, where we obtain 𝑐 ≥ 2 ∗ 0.51 = 1.02. This implies an average ratio of at least
𝑒 1.02 = 2.77 of subsequent differences between transformed cutoff points 𝜏̃ 𝑘 = 𝑒 𝑐𝜏𝑘 . Our
analysis in Section 4.1 suggests that a scale with such a ratio does not seem plausible.

Conclusions

This paper made three main contributions. First, we derived a test of whether reversals of OLS
regression coefficients are possible. In this context, we showed that reversals are caused by
variables having heterogenous effects across the distribution of happiness. Second, we argued that
in cases where reversals by “relabelling” are impossible, reversals using Bond & Lang’s method are
speculative from an empirical point of view. Third, we presented arguments and evidence showing
that respondents likely use the response scale in a roughly linear fashion. In addition, using SOEP
data, we empirically investigated the possibility and plausibility of reversals for a set of key variables.
We found that reversals using relabelling are impossible or implausible in most cases and that
reversals using Bond & Lang’s indirect method are mostly implausible.
Practically, our results suggest that when researchers merely wish to identify the direction of effects
of explanatory variables, standard methods are robust to the worries flagged by Bond and Lang
(2019) and Schröder and Yitzhaki (2017). Nevertheless, since effects of explanatory variables are
rarely homogenous across the distribution of happiness, trade-off ratios of coefficients may be
affected by plausible transformations of reported happiness scores. We therefore urge researchers
to verify the sensitivity of their results against plausible transformations of reported happiness.
Moreover, we recommend that researchers ascertain whether our relabelling condition is satisfied
for their application, thus verifying (or not) that their results are immune to reversals.
A limitation of our analysis is that we ignore any potential problems arising from heterogeneities
in scale use. As argued in e.g. Angelini et al. (2014) and Kaiser (2020), if such heterogeneities are
correlated with explanatory variables, biases in estimated effects occur. Hence, future work may
seek to analyse these issues jointly.
Lastly, our finding that the relative effects of explanatory variables are not homogenous across the
distribution of happiness shows that estimating mean effects on happiness hides patterns in the
data that are interesting and informative in their own right. As was previously done using quantile
regressions (Binder and Coad 2011; 2015; Gupta et al. 2015), such patterns should be investigated
more broadly.

Appendix A Further details on applying equations (8)-(11) to the Easterlin Paradox
example
This brief appendix extends and gives further details on the empirical analysis of Section 2.4.
For the rank-order scale (1, 2, 3) of ℎ𝑟𝑖 , Equation (11) implies 𝛽̂ = −𝛽̂𝑑1 − 𝛽̂𝑑2 . This corresponds
to Equation (1) because 𝜕𝑠3 ⁄𝜕𝑋 = − 𝜕(𝑠1 + 𝑠2 )⁄𝜕𝑋 in that equation. Hence, regression model
(9) for ℎ𝑟𝑖 when applied to data on the Easterlin Paradox example of the main text yields a negative
estimate 𝛽̂ = −0.028 of the effect of ln𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑝𝑐. This is equal to −𝛽̂𝑑1 − 𝛽̂𝑑2 = 0.025 − 0.054
up to a rounding error. This estimate is equal to the coefficient in the regression of mean happiness
𝐸(ℎ𝑡) in Table 1 but has a slightly smaller standard error.
As was the case in Section 2.1, there does not exist any ℎ𝑟 scale which is concave enough to yield
a statistically significant positive coefficient of ln𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑝𝑐 at the 5% or 10% level. At the infinitely
strongly concave ℎ𝑟 scale (1,2,2) we get a positive coefficient of 0.025 of ln𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑝𝑐 with a slightly
̃ in Table 1. This coefficient is exactly the opposite of the
higher p value of 0.14 than for E(ℎ𝑡)
coefficient in the regression of ℎ𝑑1,𝑖 (with the same p value). Thus, the Easterlin Paradox for the
USA can again not be rejected with any ℎ𝑟 scale.
Finally, the ℎ𝑟 scale which is just convex enough to yield a 5% significant negative coefficient of
ln𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑝𝑐 is now given by (1, 2, 4.72) (found numerically). This is less extreme than the scale for
̃
̃ in Table 1 because of smaller standard errors. These clustered standard errors are likely
E(ℎ𝑡)
downwardly biased because of a too low number (26) of clusters. Analogously, heteroscedasticityrobust standard errors in Table 1 tended to be smaller than the reported ordinary standard errors
because of a too low number of observations (26), and hence were not used.
Appendix B Further details on implications of allowing for variation within response
categories
At the start of Section 3.1, we note that Equation (2) can be extended so as to allow for changes in
expectations of ℎ𝑡 within response categories. Such a more flexible equation is given by:
̃
𝜕𝐸(ℎ𝑡)
𝜕𝑠3 𝜕(ℎ̃3 − ℎ̃2 )
𝜕𝑠1 𝜕(ℎ̃2 − ℎ̃1 )
= (ℎ̃3 − ℎ̃2 )
+
𝑠3 − (ℎ̃2 − ℎ̃1 )
−
𝑠1 .
𝜕𝑋
𝜕𝑋
𝜕𝑋
𝜕𝑋
𝜕𝑋

(A1)

In the main text we argue that the value of 𝐸(ℎ𝑡|ℎ𝑟 = 1) likely rose with increases in ln𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑝𝑐.
Contrariwise 𝐸(ℎ𝑡|ℎ𝑟 = 3) likely declined with increases in ln𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑝𝑐. The unobserved
derivatives 𝜕(ℎ̃3 − ℎ̃2 )⁄𝜕𝑋 and 𝜕(ℎ̃2 − ℎ̃1 )⁄𝜕𝑋 are therefore likely to be both negative.58 This
would make the sum of the first two terms on the right-hand side of Equation (A1) more negative
than the first term on the right-hand side of Equation (2). Likewise, the sum of the last two terms
in Equation (A1) will be more positive than the last term in Equation (2).
An implication of equation (A1) is that ℎ𝑟 scales for which the effect of 𝑋 on mean happiness is
zero cannot be obtained from Equation (A1) by simply factoring out the ratio
(ℎ̃2 − ℎ̃1 )⁄(ℎ̃3 − ℎ̃2 ) as in Equation (2). However, without loss of generality, we can simplify
The increase in ln𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑝𝑐 may also have led to a change in 𝐸(ℎ𝑡|ℎ𝑟 = 2) = ℎ2 . However, this change is likely to
be less strong than the rise in ℎ1 and the decline in ℎ3 because of diminishing marginal happiness of ln𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑝𝑐.

Equation (A1) by setting ℎ̃2 − ℎ̃1 equal to one (as in Table 1) and solving for ℎ̃3 − ℎ̃2 . Setting
̃ ⁄𝜕𝑋 = 0, this yields

𝜕(ℎ̃3 − ℎ̃2 )

Note that 𝜕(ℎ̃2 − ℎ̃1 )⁄𝜕𝑋 ∗ 𝑠1 in this expression is likely to be negative, while
− 𝜕(ℎ̃3 − ℎ̃2 )⁄𝜕𝑋 ∗ 𝑠3 is likely to be positive. It is therefore ambiguous whether ℎ̃3 − ℎ̃2 must
̃ ⁄𝜕𝑋 = 0. It is
be smaller or larger than the ratio (𝜕𝑠1 /𝜕𝑋)⁄(𝜕𝑠3 /𝜕𝑋) in order to obtain 𝜕𝐸(ℎ𝑡)
hence also ambiguous whether, compared to the estimates of Table 1, allowing for variation within
response categories increases or decreases the required ratio (ℎ̃2 − ℎ̃1 )⁄(ℎ̃3 − ℎ̃2 ) at which the
effect of ln𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑝𝑐 on mean happiness becomes zero.
As a second implication of Equation (A1), we can assess the likelihood that the effect of ln𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑝𝑐
on mean happiness becomes significantly positive in the limit for ℎ̃3 − ℎ̃2 → 0, so for
̃ in Table 1). According to Equation (A1)
(ℎ̃ − ℎ̃ )⁄(ℎ̃ − ℎ̃ ) → ∞ (see the estimate for E(ℎ𝑡)

𝜕(ℎ̃3 − ℎ̃2 )⁄𝜕ln𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑝𝑐 ∗ 𝑠3 is negligibly small, 𝜕𝐸(ℎ𝑡)

converges to − 𝜕𝑠1 ⁄𝜕ln𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑝𝑐 − 𝜕(ℎ̃2 − ℎ̃1 )⁄𝜕ln𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑝𝑐 ∗ 𝑠1 . Given the arguments above and
in the main text, − 𝜕(ℎ̃2 − ℎ̃1 )⁄𝜕ln𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑝𝑐 ∗ 𝑠1 in this expression is likely to be positive and likely
to be positively correlated with the positive term − 𝜕𝑠1 ⁄𝜕ln𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑝𝑐 . Therefore, allowing for
variation within response categories makes it more likely that the effect of ln𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑝𝑐 on mean
happiness becomes significantly positive in the limit for ℎ̃3 − ℎ̃2 → 0.
Appendix C Alternative derivation of reversal condition (16)

any 𝑐. We therefore just solve for 𝑐 in

𝑣′(𝜖𝑖 ) = 𝜖𝑖 𝜑(𝜖𝑖 ). Hence, 𝑢′(𝜖𝑖 ) = 𝑒 𝑐𝜎𝑖 𝜖𝑖 𝑐𝜎𝑖 and 𝑣(𝜖𝑖 ) = −𝜑(𝜖𝑖 ), yielding

Appendix D An argument from psychophysics
Psychophysicists analyse how subjective intensities across different “modalities” relate to
intensities of objective stimuli. To do so, respondents are often asked to match a given stimulus
𝑠 𝑚 of modality 𝑚 (e.g. a sound with a given physical intensity), which is associated with a subjective
intensity 𝜓𝑚 (i.e. that sound’s subjective loudness), with another stimulus of a different modality
𝑠 𝑛 (e.g. the objective luminosity of a lamp) with intensity 𝜓𝑛 (i.e. that lamp’s subjective brightness).
Such procedures are known as “cross-modality matching” (Shepard 1981).
Answers to happiness questions can be placed in this framework. Note that a person’s true
happiness ℎ𝑡 represents a subjective intensity 𝜓ℎ𝑡 .59 Furthermore, the 𝑅 numbered response
options in any happiness question can be viewed as physical number stimuli 𝑠1𝑛𝑢𝑚 , . . . , 𝑠𝑅𝑛𝑢𝑚 ,
associated with subjective intensities 𝜓1𝑛𝑢𝑚 , . . . , 𝜓𝑅𝑛𝑢𝑚 . Although surveys are not explicitly framed
as cross-modality matching tasks, respondents may attempt to match the subjective intensity of
each numbered response option with their felt happiness intensity. When choosing a response
option with number 𝑘, a respondent at time 𝑡 may thus minimize the difference 𝜓𝑘𝑛𝑢𝑚 − 𝜓𝑡ℎ𝑡 . In
turn, this implies that when a respondent initially answered e.g. “6” and now answered e.g. “8”, we
can infer that the difference in happiness intensities is approximately equal to the difference in the
𝑛𝑢𝑚
𝑛𝑢𝑚
ℎ𝑡
ℎ𝑡
subjective intensities of the number stimuli “6” and “8”, i.e. that 𝜓𝑡=2
− 𝜓𝑡=1
≈ 𝜓𝑘=8
− 𝜓𝑘=6
.
Therefore, if we were to identify the differences between subjective intensities of numbers, we can
infer the differences in psychological magnitudes of ℎ𝑡.
Banks & Coleman (1981) tried to experimentally infer the function that relates objective with
subjective magnitudes of a given finite set of numbers.60 It is not feasible to directly ask how certain
numbers “feel”, since when e.g. asked whether the difference between the numbers “6” and “8” is
larger than difference between the numbers “3” and “4”, respondents would likely apply formal
arithmetic rules. To circumvent this problem, Banks & Coleman utilized the following procedure:
Respondents were given multiple series of ten different integers 𝐼 on a known interval (e.g. from 1
to 1000). Each series was generated by a function of the form 𝐼 = 𝑎𝑥 𝑏 , with 𝑥 = 1, 2, … ,10; 𝑏 =
0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 1.1 (note that 𝑏 = 1 would yield a linear function) and with 𝑎 chosen such
that the minimum and maximum of the series are as close as possible to the interval boundaries.
Within each series, 𝑏 was held constant while using every value of 𝑥. The resulting integers were
Happiness is unusual in that there is no single physical stimulus 𝑠 ℎ𝑡 corresponding to a particular level of 𝜓 ℎ𝑡 .
60 Which is a function satisfying 𝑓(𝑠 𝑛𝑢𝑚 ) = 𝜓 𝑛𝑢𝑚 . We only report Banks & Coleman’s results for cases with known
𝑘
𝑘
bounded intervals within which numbers can occur. This is because only these results are directly relevant to typical
response scales in happiness research. Banks & Coleman also present results for intervals without a known upper
bound. In such cases, they find that power functions with exponents between 0.3 and 0.5 (i.e. concave functions) are
a much better approximation of the subjective intensities of numbers. These results are in line with those of Schneider
et al. (1974) as well as Banks & Hill (1974) who use similar methods.
36
59

then randomly shuffled. Respondents were next asked to rate how “random” these series of
numbers felt. Under the assumption that respondents took “random” to mean “sampled from a
uniform distribution”, we should expect respondents to give series where the distribution of
subjective intensities more closely resembled a uniform distribution to receive a higher subjective
“randomness” rating.61 It turns out that functions with exponents 𝑏 = 0.9 or 𝑏 = 1.1 received the
highest mean randomness rankings across respondents. This suggests that the subjective intensity
of numbers within a known bounded range is close to linear in the objective magnitude of such
numbers. In a separate experimental setup, Banks & Coleman also asked respondents to rapidly
think of 25 random numbers on some bounded interval (either 1-10, 10-99, or 100-999).
Respondents’ answers were put in rank order and means for each rank were calculated across
respondents. OLS regressions of these means on their rank yielded R-squared statistics between
0.974 (for the interval 10-99) and 0.995 (for the interval 1-10). These results also suggest a linear
relation between objective values of numbers and their subjective intensities.
Given the aforementioned arguments, if the subjective intensity of numbers increases linearly with
their objective magnitude on a bounded interval, we have further reason to believe that rank-order
ℎ𝑟 and ℎ𝑡 also relate linearly.

This assumes that how random a series of numbers feels, only depends on the subjective intensities of the numbers
in the series, and not on their objective magnitudes. Since felt randomness is a subjective perception itself, we find this
assumption reasonable.
