Abstract
Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) and other transposons can act as tissue-specific
regulators of gene expression in cis, with potential to affect biological processes. In
cancer, epigenetic alterations and transcription factor misregulation may uncover the
regulatory potential of typically repressed ERVs, which could contribute to tumour
evolution and progression. Here, we asked whether transposons help to rewire
oncogenic transcriptional circuits in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Using epigenomic
data from both primary cells and cell lines, we have identified six ERV families that are
frequently found in an open chromatin state in AML when compared to differentiated
healthy myeloid cells. A subset of these AML-associated ERVs harbour enhancerspecific histone modifications, and are bound by hematopoiesis-associated
transcription factors that play key roles in haematopoiesis and in the pathogenesis of
AML. Using CRISPR-mediated genetic editing and simultaneous epigenetic silencing
of multiple ERV copies, we have established causal links between ERV deregulation
in AML and expression changes of adjacent genes. Finally, we show that deletion and
epigenetic silencing of an ERV, through modulating expression of APOC1 gene, leads
to growth suppression by inducing apoptosis in leukemia cell lines. Our results suggest
that ERV derepression provides an additional layer of gene regulation in AML that may
be exploited by cancer cells to help drive oncogenic phenotypes.

Introduction
Transposable elements (TEs) act primarily as selfish genetic entities that have
expanded to make up around half of the human genome (Lander et al., 2001). Although
they are commonly repressed by host epigenetic mechanisms, TEs are frequently coopted as tissue-specific gene regulatory elements, such as alternative gene promoters
and distal enhancers (Chuong et al., 2017). Notably, up to 34% of transcription factor
(TF) binding sites in the human genome are derived from TEs (Sundaram et al., 2014),
with an overrepresentation from long terminal repeat (LTR) families, which include
endogenous retroviruses (ERVs). LTRs frequently recombine, leaving the majority of
ERV elements as intact solitary LTRs with potential gene regulatory activity (Belshaw
et al., 2007; Thomas et al., 2018). In line with this notion, genome-wide assays have
documented that numerous LTR sequences carry hallmarks of active regulatory
elements (Chuong et al., 2016; 2013; Fuentes et al., 2018; Jacques et al., 2013;
Kunarso et al., 2010; Lynch et al., 2011; Pontis et al., 2019; Sundaram et al., 2014). In
a few instances, loss-of-function experiments have provided compelling evidence of
LTR co-option for host gene regulation and cellular function in hematopoiesis (Pi et al.,
2010), innate immunity (Chuong et al., 2016), pregnancy (Ferreira et al., 2016) and
fertility (Flemr et al., 2013).
Various studies have documented widespread epigenetic and transcriptional
deregulation of TEs in several cancer types, raising the possibility that TE-derived
regulatory elements may be exploited to promote tumorigenesis (Babaian and Mager,
2016; Burns, 2017). Indeed, activation of LTR-based promoters initiates cancerspecific chimeric transcripts in Hodgkin lymphoma, melanoma and diffuse large B-cell
lymphoma, among others (Babaian and Mager, 2016; Edginton-White et al., 2019;
Jang et al., 2019). These so-called onco-exaptation events were recently shown to be
highly prevalent in multiple cancer types (Jang et al., 2019). However, studies to date
have been largely centered on LTR promoter activity. As the function of TEs as
enhancers is more challenging to discern, such cases remain largely unexplored in
malignancies, with one notable exception of a recent study showing that systematic
perturbation of LTR5_Hs family in the human embryonic carcinoma affects host gene
transcription over long genomic ranges (Fuentes et al., 2018).
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a highly heterogeneous clonal malignancy,
characterized by the combinations of distinct driver mutations (Cancer Genome Atlas
Research Network et al., 2013). Notably, over 70% AML patients have a genetic
abnormality in one epigenetic modifier (Papaemmanuil et al., 2016). Interestingly,
altered chromatin landscape, including DNA methylation (Figueroa et al., 2010),
histone modifications and chromatin accessibility (Assi et al., 2018; Yi et al., 2019)

Consequently, widespread disruption of epigenetic patterns is a characteristic feature
of AML, which may stimulate TE activation as regulatory elements. In this respect,
AML is an ideal model system to explore onco-exaptation of TEs and determine to
what extent such events are important for maintaining the expression of genes that
promote malignancy progression and evolution.
Here we have identified six ERV/LTR families with putative regulatory potential in AML,
bearing enhancer-like epigenomic signatures and binding of TFs that play key roles in
haematopoiesis and in the pathogenesis of AML. Deletion of selected ERV copies and
epigenetic inactivation of an entire ERV family demonstrated their roles as gene
regulators. Remarkably, we found that genetic and epigenetic perturbation of a single
LTR copy leads to impaired cell growth by modulating expression of APOC1 gene,
suggesting that the activation of this particular LTR has a driving role in leukemia cell
phenotype.
Results
Identification of putative AML-specific regulatory TEs
In order to assess whether cellular transformation in AML unmasked intrinsic
regulatory activity of TEs, we identified putative regulatory TEs by focusing on repeat
families that were frequently associated with open chromatin in AML. To this end, we
analysed DNase-seq data from 32 AML samples generated by the Blueprint
epigenome project (Yi et al., 2019), and compared them with data from differentiated
myeloid cells (macrophages, monocytes) from the same consortium (Figure 1A).
Additionally, we generated our own DNase-seq data from three commonly used AML
cell lines with different genetic and cytogenetic backgrounds: HL-60, MOLM-13 and
OCI-AML3.

with random controls (Supplementary Table 1). We identified 12 repeat families that
were enriched for DHS-associated copies in at least one of the AML cell lines and in
10% or more of the AML samples (Figure 1B). Five of these families were highly
enriched across all samples, including macrophages and monocytes, as well as
mobilized CD34+ cells (data from the Roadmap epigenomics project), suggesting little
cell specificity. The remaining seven families displayed more variability between AML
samples and, notably, tended to display little to no enrichment in differentiated myeloid
cells (Figure 1B). Nearly all families were also DHS-enriched in CD34+ cells,
suggesting an association with a stem cell state. The exception was the LTR2B family,
whose DHS enrichment appeared to be AML-specific. Analysis of an independent

dataset of 32 AML samples from the Bonifer lab (Assi et al., 2018) confirmed the DHS
enrichment at all of the above families, and identified additional weaker associations,
including with several Alu subfamilies (Supplementary Figure 1A). For stringency, we
focused on families that were DHS-enriched in both datasets, all of which are LTRs
from ERVs: LTR2B, LTR2C, LTR5B, LTR5_Hs, LTR12C, LTR13A. We excluded the
internal portion of HERVK (HERVK-int) because its enrichment was largely due to the
fragmented nature of the Repeatmasker annotation, and because its LTRs (LTR5B,
LTR5_Hs) displayed much higher DNase-seq signal than the internal portion
(Supplementary Figure 1B). We will collectively refer to the six selected ERV families
as ‘AML DHS-associated repeats’ (A-DARs). The oldest A-DARs (LTR5B, LTR13A)
date back to the common ancestor between hominoids and old world monkeys,
whereas the youngest (LTR5_Hs) are human-specific (Hubley et al., 2016).
The DNase-seq profiles across each ERV displayed a consistent pattern for elements
of the same family in AML cell lines (less evident for LTR2C), suggestive of TF binding
events within these ERVs (Figure 1C displays OCI-AML3 profiles). This pattern was
also notable in primary AML cells, albeit variable between samples (Supplementary
Figure 1C), reflecting the heterogeneity of this disease. Out of a total of 4,811 A-DAR
elements, 80-661 (median 263) overlapped a DHS in AML samples from the Blueprint
dataset. These values were higher in the Assi et al dataset (223-1,349; median 508)
possibly due to technical differences. As heterogeneity in AML is partly driven by
genetics, we hypothesized that variation in DHS frequency at A-DARs could reflect
distinct mutational profiles. To test this, we measured inter-sample correlations in the
DHS patterns of A-DARs, which revealed distinct clusters associated to the mutational
profile in AML patient samples (Supplementary Figure 2A). Although there was no
strict association with particular AML subtypes, we found that samples with NPM1
mutations were better inter-correlated than those without (Supplementary Figure 2B).
The same was true for samples with FLT3-ITD and DNMT3A mutations, which
frequently co-occur with NPM1 mutations, as well as those with CEBPA mutations
(Supplementary Figure 2B). Specific mutations may therefore help to establish
particular patterns of ERV activation in AML, although other characteristics of the
malignancy are also likely to affect them.
A-DAR chromatin status correlates with nearby gene expression
To test whether A-DARs were associated with gene activation, we analysed matching
DNase-seq and RNA-seq data from the Blueprint consortium. ERVs can affect the
expression of proximal genes, but also act at a distance via long-range interactions in
3D space (Fuentes et al., 2018; Raviram et al., 2018). However, long-range

interactions display substantial cell specificity, namely within the hematopoietic system
(Javierre et al., 2016). Given the heterogeneity between AML samples and the lack of
matching Hi-C data, we focused our analysis on genes within 50 kb of an ERV from
the selected families. Genes lying close to A-DAR elements with DHS in 2 or more
AML samples displayed higher expression levels than those lying close to A-DAR
elements without DHS (Figure 1D). This was more pronounced for ERVs with DHS
also present in differentiated cells. Such bulk correlations are only suggestive of a
regulatory role of ERVs and need to be formally tested for a causal link, as we have
previously shown (Todd et al., 2019). Nonetheless, we found ERVs with strong
supporting evidence for their regulatory activity, as the expression levels of their vicinity
genes were >4-fold higher in AML samples with DHS at a given ERV, versus those
without (Figure 1E). This included a strict correlation between chromatin accessibility
at a LTR12C element and the expression of the SCIN gene (Figure 1F), which has a
mild predictive value for AML prognosis (Z.-H. Zhang et al., 2018). TPD52 and AHSP
expression, which were correlated with the presence of DHS at a LTR12C and LTR5B
element respectively, have also been linked to AML prognosis (Ha et al., 2019; Zhu et
al., 2017). These data suggest that at least some A-DAR elements gain gene
regulatory activity in AML, which correlates with disease outcomes.
A-DARs bear signatures of enhancer elements
DNase hypersensitivity is associated with both active gene promoters and distal
enhancers. LTR12C elements, for example, were previously shown to frequently act
as alternative gene promoters in different cell types, including hepatocellular
carcinoma (Hashimoto et al., 2015) and cell lines treated with DNMT and HDAC
inhibitors (Brocks et al., 2017). In contrast, LTR5_Hs (HERV-K) elements appear to
mainly act as distal enhancer elements in embryonic carcinoma cells and embryonic
stem cells (Fuentes et al., 2018; Pontis et al., 2019). We therefore aimed to establish
whether A-DARs could act as promoters and/or enhancers in AML.
To test for gene promoter activity, we performed de novo transcriptome assembly in
AML samples and differentiated myeloid cells, and calculated the number of spliced
transcripts for which the transcriptional start site (TSS) overlapped an A-DAR element.
AML samples displayed 31-53 such transcripts, whereas differentiated cells had 2028, most of which emanated from LTR12C elements (Figure 2A). We identified 82
spliced transcripts that were present in two or more AML samples but were absent in
differentiated cells (Supplementary Table 2). Most of these were short transcripts and
only 26 had evidence of splicing into exons of annotated genes. One example involved
a LTR2C element active in a subset of AMLs, which acted as a non-reference promoter

for SAGE1 (Figure 2B), a known cancer/testis antigen (Chen et al., 2014; Piotti et al.,
2013).
We then asked whether A-DARs are frequently marked by histone modifications
typically associated with promoters or enhancers. Using ChIP-seq data from the
Blueprint consortium, we first plotted the percentage of elements from each ERV family
that were marked by H3K27ac, H3K4me1, H3K4me3 or H3K9me3 in AML and
differentiated myeloid cells (Supplementary Figure 3A). Notably, in AML samples an
average 5.7-15.2% of elements from each family overlapped H3K4me1 peaks, a mark
predominantly associated with poised and active enhancers. This was substantially
higher than the fraction overlapping with the active promoter mark H3K4me3 (1.33.4%). Indeed, a more detailed analysis of histone modification patterns at A-DAR
elements showed that H3K4me1 is either found in conjunction with H3K27ac (active
enhancers), or on its own (primed enhancers) but is more rarely found together with
H3K4me3 (Figure 2C, Supplementary Figure 3B). Clustering analysis of these patterns
demonstrated that while some elements within a family bear active marks in both AML
and differentiated cells, a substantial portion (10-37%, depending on the family;
median 20%) display enhancer-like profiles only in AML samples (Figure 2C,
Supplementary Figure 3B). Profiles of the ChIP-seq signals confirmed that these AMLspecific elements had elevated H3K4me1 and H3K27ac in AML when compared to
differentiated cells (Figure 2D). A total of 1,122 and 411 A-DAR elements were marked
by H3K4me1 and H3K27ac respectively, in at least two AML samples. A-DARs are
therefore frequently associated with enhancer-like profiles in AML.
To test whether myeloid leukemia cell lines could be used to dissect the putative
enhancer roles of A-DARs, we performed H3K27ac ChIP-seq on HL-60, MOLM-13,
OCI-AML3 and K562 cells, and compared patterns with those seen in AML samples.
A-DAR elements that overlap H3K27ac peaks in AML samples were also frequently
associated with this mark in cell lines (Figure 2E). A ChromHMM annotation for K562
cells from ENCODE further supported that these elements often bear enhancer
signatures (Figure 2E). It is worth noting that there is substantial variation in H3K27ac
enrichment of A-DARs among cell lines, much like primary AML samples.
Nonetheless, example loci show that H3K27ac deposition at A-DAR elements in cell
lines can recapitulate primary AML data (Figure 2F), opening up the opportunity to
functionally test for enhancer activity of these loci by genetic and epigenetic editing
approaches.

A-DARs bind AML-related TFs
Two large-scale data mining efforts had previously identified several TFs that are
associated with ERV families identified here, either through ChIP-seq data or motif
analyses (Jacques et al., 2013; Sundaram et al., 2014). These included
hematopoiesis- and AML-related TFs such as TAL1, SPI1, GATA2 and ARNT,
amongst others. To confirm and extend these observations, we first performed our own
analysis of TF ChIP-seq data from K562 cells (ENCODE consortium). Our comparison
with AML data above gave us confidence that K562 cells were an adequate model to
study TF binding patterns at A-DARs. We analysed all TF ChIP-seq peak data
available from ENCODE, comparing their overlap with A-DARs against a random
control. We selected TFs that are bound to at least 5% of the elements in a given ERV
family, in a statistically significant manner, yielding a list of 217 TFs (Figure 3A;
Supplementary Table 3). The vast majority of these TFs were found to be expressed
in AML samples (198 had higher expression than TBP). Many of these TFs are
involved in hematopoietic gene regulation and/or in the etiology of AML, including
SPI1, TAL1, IKZF1 and PKNOX1 (Figure 3A). ChIP-seq profiles of individual elements
revealed a localized pattern of TF binding at a subset of elements (Figure 3B). Notably,
different ERV families bind different combinations of TFs.
We also performed TF motif analysis, looking for enrichment against shuffled
sequence controls (Figure 3C, Supplementary Table 4). Reassuringly, the results from
this analysis were largely congruent with the ChIP-seq data. Apart from confirming the
presence of motifs for SPI1, PKNOX1 and other TFs, we also found enrichment for
HOXA9/MEIS1 motifs in four different ERV families. High HOXA9 and MEIS1
expression is associated with specific AML subtypes, namely NPM1 mutated AMLs
(Mullighan et al., 2007), and are sufficient to drive leukemogenesis in mouse models
(Kroon et al., 1998). It remains to be tested whether the presence of HOXA9/MEIS1
motifs is what drives NPM1-specific patterns of DHSs at A-DARs (Supplementary
Figure 2B). In line with the high frequency of many of the identified TF motifs, we found
that they were present in the consensus sequences of each ERV family (Figure 3D),
suggesting that the respective retroviruses brought in these motifs within their LTRs
upon invasion of the human genome. Finally, we asked whether some TF motifs were
responsible for chromatin opening at individual elements. We compared motif
frequency between elements with DHSs (DHS+) in at least five of the analysed AML
samples and DHS-negative elements (Figure 3E). Although some TFs were
preferentially associated with DHS+ elements (e.g., CEBPB in LTR2B), many were
not, and none were sufficient to explain the presence or absence of DHSs. For
example, even though SPI1 binding motif is present in the majority of DHS+ elements,

a large portion of non-DHS elements also harbor this motif (Figure 3E). This suggests
that other factors play a role in determining LTR regulatory potential, in line with our
previous observations in mouse stem cells (Todd et al., 2019).
These analyses suggest that the potential regulatory activity at particular ERV families
in AML is likely driven by the binding of hematopoiesis-associated TFs, which are
either upregulated in AML or whose binding sites become accessible in AML through
epigenetic alterations.
Genetic excision of A-DAR elements interferes with host gene expression
To test for causal roles of enhancer-like A-DAR elements in gene regulation, we used
CRISPR-Cas9 to delete three candidate ERVs. The selected ERVs are enriched in
H3K27ac, bound by multiple hematopoiesis-associated TFs in K562 cells (Figure 4A),
and overlap DHSs in multiple AML samples, but not in monocytes or macrophages
(Supplementary Figure 4). We generated clonal lines from K562 cells that had
heterozygous or homozygous deletions of these A-DAR elements, and measured the
expression of associated genes in multiple clones. Other leukemia cell lines (HL-60,
OCI-AML3, MOLM-13) proved more refractory to genetic deletion, due to the low
efficiency of Cas9 delivery and single cell expansion.
One of the deleted loci was a LTR5B element located in the first intron of ZNF321P,
which is bound by PKNOX1, SPI1, STAT5 and TAL1 (Figure 4A, top). Deletion of this
element led to a significant decrease in ZNF321P expression and also affected the
expression of two other nearby genes, ZNF320 and ZNF888 (Figure 4B, left). Notably,
all three genes display higher expression in AML samples when compared to
monocytes and macrophages (Figure 4B, right). Interestingly, ZNF320 is also
upregulated in multiple cancer types (Machnik et al., 2019), but its relevance to cancer
etiology remains unclear. ZNF320 is a member of the Krüppel-associated box (KRAB)
domain zinc finger family and predominantly binds LTR14A and LTR14B elements
(Imbeault et al., 2017), suggesting a potential role in ERV silencing. Heterozygous
deletion of another LTR5B element, bound by BCOR, SPI1, TAL1 and RUNX1 (Figure
4A, middle), reduced the expression of Ribosomal Protein L7 Like 1 (RPL7L1) (Figure
4C, left), which is upregulated in AML when compared to differentiated myeloid cells
(Figure 4C, right). Notably, this specific LTR5B contains a single nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) for which the minor allele (highest population frequency of 0.41)
disrupts a MAFK binding motif (Supplementary Figure 4C). Using data from the GTEx
project, we found that the minor allele was associated with lower RPL7L1 expression
in whole blood (Supplementary Figure 4C), suggesting that the MAFK motif is
important for RPL7L1 expression. The third deleted locus was an LTR13A element

located in the vicinity of BCL2 interacting killer (BIK), and is enriched for IKFZ1,
PKNOX1 and BCOR binding (Figure 4A, bottom). Excision of this particular element
led to around 3-fold reduction in BIK expression (Figure 4D, left), which is higher in
AML samples when compared to other hematopoietic cell types (Figure 4D, right). This
LTR13A also contains a SNP, where the minor allele (highest population frequency of
0.5) is a critical residue in a RUNX1 binding site, but that was not associated with any
significant differences in BIK expression in whole blood (Supplementary Figure 4E).
Overall, CRISPR-mediated genetic deletion assays demonstrate a role of a subset of
A-DAR elements in gene regulation in K562 cells. Moreover, DHSs within the
candidate ERVs and high expression of their associated genes in AML patients provide
strong evidence for their regulatory activation in vivo.
CRISPRi-mediated inactivation of LTR2B elements leads to growth suppression
To test the regulatory function of multiple A-DAR elements simultaneously, we next
sought to epigenetically silence one ERV family by CRISPR interference (CRISPRi)
using a catalytically dead Cas9 (dCas9) fused to the KRAB transcriptional repressor
protein. We chose the LTR2B family mainly because this was the only one whose DHS
enrichment was significant only in AML samples, and not in CD34+ cells (Figure 1B),
suggesting a more cancer-specific role than other A-DARs. We designed 4 sgRNAs
targeting the most conservative regions of LTR2B family, predicted to recognize
around 217 copies (68%) when allowing zero mismatches complementary to the
sgRNAs. Our LTR2B sgRNAs are also predicted to target copies of highly related LTR2
copies (71 copies; 8%). We first generated stable CRISPRi OCI-AML3 and K562 cell
lines and then stably introduced LTR2B sgRNAs or an empty vector control using a
lentiviral system. To determine dCas9 specificity on a genome-wide scale, we
performed dCas9 ChIP-seq in K562 cell lines expressing LTR2B sgRNAs or empty
vector. We detected 395 dCas9 peaks in cells with LTR2B sgRNAs (and none in
control cells), 187 of which were associated with LTR2B elements, and 90 with LTR2
elements (Figure 5A,B). The remaining 118 peaks (Figure 5B) were included in
downstream analyses to evaluate putative off-target effects. We also performed
H3K27ac and H3K9me3 ChIP-seq in the same cells to assess the epigenetic changes
imparted by CRISPRi. We quantified the ratio in histone modification levels at dCas9
peaks between cells expressing LTR2B sgRNAs and those with the empty vector
control. As expected, upon CRISPRi in K562 cells we observed a reduction of
H3K27ac signal and/or gain of H3K9me3 signal at most loci bound by dCas9,
demonstrating effective epigenetic editing (Figure 5C,D). Notably, LTR2B/LTR2 target
sites generally underwent more pronounced changes in H3K27ac and H3K9me3

levels when compared to off-target sites. Changes in histone modification levels upon
CRISPRi were further confirmed by ChIP-qPCR at LTR2B elements (Supplementary
Figure 5A). In OCI-AML3 cells we observed a similar trend in epigenetic alterations
upon CRISPRi, albeit to a lesser extent than in K562 cells (Supplementary Figure
5B,C).
Intriguingly, proliferation assays showed that epigenetic silencing of LTR2B and LTR2
elements by CRISPRi significantly suppressed cell proliferation in both K562 and OCIAML3 cell lines (Figure 5E). To test the impact of LTR2B and LTR2 inactivation on the
host transcriptome, and gain insights into the mechanism underlying impaired cell
growth, we performed RNA-seq in both cell lines (Figure 5F; Supplementary Figure
5D). We identified a total of 58 and 99 differentially expressed genes in K562 and OCIAML3 cells, respectively (Supplementary Table 5). To elucidate direct effects of
CRISPRi, we focused on genes that are within 50 kb of a dCas9 peak and found 15
and 6 differentially expressed genes (in K562 and OCI-AML3 cells, respectively), all
but one of which were downregulated. Only one of these genes (BIK), which was
downregulated in OCI-AML3, was associated with an off-target dCas9 peak. The
remaining genes were associated with 15 different LTR2B/LTR2 elements. In some
instances, the LTR2B/LTR2 element was very close to the promoter of the affected
gene, such that silencing could have resulted from H3K9me3 spreading. We therefore
performed genetic deletion of one of these elements, which also led to a decrease in
gene expression of the adjacent ZNF611 gene, albeit to a lesser extent than by
CRISPRi (Supplementary Figure 5E). Several genes displayed decreased expression
in both cell lines (Figure 5G), although only apolipoprotein C1 (APOC1) reached
statistical significance in both contexts. Notably, five apolipoprotein genes were
downregulated in at least one of the cell lines. APOC1, APOC2, APOC4-APOC2 and
APOE lie within a cluster on chromosome 19, and may all be controlled by the same
LTR2 element, located upstream of APOC1. On the other hand, APOL1 is on
chromosome 22 and close to an LTR2B insertion. Given the key roles that lipid
metabolism plays in supporting cancer cell survival (Beloribi-Djefaflia et al., 2016), the
coordinated downregulation of apolipoprotein genes could underpin the reduced cell
growth observed upon silencing of LTR2B/LTR2 elements in leukemia cell lines.
Overall, these data show that a subset of LTR2B and LTR2 elements act as key gene
regulators in leukemia cell lines, and that their epigenetic silencing impairs cell growth,
providing evidence for a putative functional role in AML.

APOC1-associated LTR2 is required for proliferation of myeloid leukemia cells
APOC1 has recently been shown to maintain cell survival in AML and the knockdown
of APOC1 impairs cell growth (Yang et al., 2018). Similar findings were made in
pancreatic and colorectal cancer, where APOC1 overexpression is associated with
poor prognosis (Ren et al., 2019; Takano et al., 2008). We therefore asked whether
ERV-mediated regulation of APOC1 could affect cell growth. There is an LTR2
insertion upstream of the APOC1 promoter (APOC1-LTR2; Figure 6A, Supplementary
Figure 6A), which has been previously described to act as an alternative promoter in
several tissues, but only accounts for up to 15% of total APOC1 transcription
(Medstrand et al., 2001). In K562 and OCI-AML3 RNA-seq data, we find no evidence
of APOC1-LTR2 promoter activity (Figure 6A), which we have confirmed by RT-qPCR
(Supplementary Figure 6B), suggesting that APOC1-LTR2 acts as an enhancer
element.

APOC1-LTR2 is enriched in STAT5 and TAL1 binding and shows an

increase in H3K9me3 and decrease in H3K27ac upon CRISPRi in both K562 and OCIAML3 (Figure 6A, Supplementary Figure 6A). To test for a direct role of APOC1-LTR2
in APOC1 gene expression and cell growth, we deleted this element in K562 cells. We
obtained 7 heterozygous and 8 homozygous clones from a total of 110 clones.
Interestingly, none of the homozygous clones were able to grow more than 10 days in
culture, suggesting that homozygous deletion may impair cell growth. To pursue the
impact of APOC1-LTR2 on cell growth, we used lentiviral-mediated CRISPR-Cas9
delivery and performed assays in a pool of edited cells (Figure 6B). At day 6, after GFP
and puromycin selection of the two flanking sgRNAs, we observed around 60%
deletion of APOC1-LTR2 and more than 2.5-fold reduction in APOC1 gene expression
compared to an empty vector control (Figure 6C,D). Remarkably, deletion of this
element was sufficient to drive a significant suppression of cell proliferation compared
to control cells (Figure 6E). As there is a small fraction of unedited cells in the pool, we
asked whether the unedited cells may outcompete edited cells over time. After day 20,
the deletion was reduced to around 35% and only 1.2-fold difference was observed in
APOC1 expression, and consequently there was no difference in cell proliferation after
day 20, indicating that APOC1-LTR2 provides cells with a selective growth advantage
(Figure 6C,D; Supplementary Figure 6C). To further investigate how APOC1-LTR2
deletion leads to impaired cell growth, we analyzed cell cycle and apoptosis with flow
cytometry in K562 cells at day 6. While no differences in G1, S, and G2 phases were
detected, there was a significant increase in the sub-G1 population (Figure 6F) in
edited cells. In agreement with this, Annexin V signal was significantly higher in edited
cells compared to unedited cells at day 6 (Figure 6G), showing that the deletion of
APOC1-LTR2 induces apoptosis, which is in line with known effects of APOC1

depletion (Ren et al., 2019; Takano et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2018). As expected, this
difference is much smaller after day 20 (Supplementary Figure 6D). We also tested
the effect of APOC1-LTR2 deletion in OCI-AML3 cells, but due to the low efficiency of
Cas9 delivery and low viability of cells at day 6, we performed expression and annexin
V analysis at day 10. Similar to what we observed in K562 cells, APOC1-LTR2 deletion
in OCI-AML3 cells led to around 4-fold decrease in APOC1 expression and increased
annexin V signal, and these effects were milder at day 23 (Supplementary Figure
6E,F).
Together, our findings indicate that the APOC1-LTR2 element is essential for
proliferation of leukemia cells by acting as an enhancer of the APOC1 gene, which in
turn controls cell survival via an anti-apoptotic mechanism.
Discussion
Here we provide multiple lines of evidence that particular ERVs are used as regulatory
elements to activate gene expression in AML, which may be exploited by cancer cells
to help drive disease phenotypes and cancer progression. It had been previously
postulated that the epigenetically relaxed state of cancer cells provides a window of
opportunity for ERV activation, triggering their intrinsic regulatory capacity (Babaian
and Mager, 2016; Chuong et al., 2017; Lamprecht et al., 2010). However, to the best
of our knowledge, all examples to date supporting this hypothesis have involved
activation of cryptic promoters to drive expression of adjacent genes (Babaian and
Mager, 2016; Jang et al., 2019). Whilst we uncovered some examples of chimeric
transcripts starting from ERVs in AML (e.g., LTR2C-SAGE1), which are not present in
differentiated myeloid cells, our analyses suggest that active A-DARs mainly harbour
chromatin signatures of enhancers.
In line with previous studies, only a subset of all the elements in a given ERV family
(10-37%) are marked by active histone modifications and bound by haematopoiesisrelated TFs, despite a high level of motif conservation across ERV copies.
Nonetheless, we identified multiple ERV elements with strong evidence supporting
their role as bona fide gene regulators: 1) we found striking correlations between
differential chromatin accessibility at 20 ERVs and the expression of nearby genes,
some of which have been linked to AML prognosis (Figure 1E,F); 2) CRISPR-mediated
genetic editing experiments revealed an additional five ERVs that act as enhancers in
leukemia cells (Figure 4, Supplementary Figure 5E, Figure 6); 3) CRISPRi identified
another 13 different elements whose epigenetic silencing led to the down-regulation of
nearby genes (Supplementary Table 6). A more exhaustive search would likely have
revealed additional regulatory elements, namely via epigenetic silencing of other ERV

families. We were also purposefully conservative in our assessment of ERV effects on
gene expression, which may frequently extend beyond 50 kb, although additional
evidence would then be necessary to support a direct role.
Despite the growing evidence that ERVs can act as regulatory elements in different
cancers, there are limited examples for their inappropriate activation contributing to
oncogenesis, a term coined as onco-exaptation (Babaian et al., 2016). The term has
been frequently used to describe the gain of regulatory activity at TEs in cancer. Our
view is that, similar to the term exaptation (Gould and Vrba, 1982), onco-exaptation
requires that this new regulatory activity provides the cancer cell with a selective
advantage. Strong demonstrations of such adaptive roles are scarce. Notably, the
Wang lab recently showed that an AluJb element acts as an oncogenic promoter to
drive LIN28B expression and tumour progression in lung cancer (Jang et al., 2019). In
our study we identified an LTR2 element, the genetic and epigenetic perturbation of
which suppressed cell growth and induced apoptosis of leukemia cell lines by altering
lipid-related APOC1 expression. Despite the striking cellular phenotype in cell lines,
comprehensive analyses of primary AML samples are warranted to demonstrate
whether these regulatory ERVs are sufficient to provide survival advantages for the
cancer cells in vivo and contribute to prognosis of AML. Notably, DNase-seq peaks
associated with APOC1-LTR2 in AML samples are subtler than those observed in cell
lines, yet a few AML samples express relatively high levels of APOC1 (Supplementary
Figure 7A,B). Interestingly, overall survival curves based on TCGA data suggest that
a small proportion of patients with high APOC1 expression have a poorer prognosis,
a pattern that is also seen in stomach adenocarcinoma (Supplementary Figure 7C,D).
A considerably larger number of patients would be necessary to confirm this finding,
although independent datasets have led to similar observations in colorectal and
pancreatic cancer (Ren et al., 2019; Takano et al., 2008). APOC1 is also activated in
monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation (Lauer et al., 1988), raising the possibility that
APOC1-LTR2 may play other roles in haematopoiesis outside of AML.
Given their repetitive nature, one intriguing question is why particular ERVs within a
family are recurrently activated in AML to drive nearby gene expression, yet the
majority of them are functionally neutral. One explanation lies in the nature of interand intra-cellular epigenetic heterogeneity that increases during malignancy formation.
This gives rise to epigenetic activation of a set of ERVs, as proposed in the epigenetic
evolution model (Babaian and Mager, 2016). Accordingly, cells harbouring activated
ERVs that drive oncogenes gain a selective advantage and increase in frequency
during cancer evolution. Therefore, clonal expansion of these cells will enable the
detection of oncogenic ERVs in a cell population. However, whether ERV activation

contributes to cancer evolution or is simply a consequence of the molecular state of
cancer remains a matter of debate.
Irrespective of whether epigenetic heterogeneity at ERVs contributes to tumour
evolution, distinct patterns of ERV activity are observed across different patients
(Supplementary Figure 1A). These differences appear to be partly driven by the
underlying mutational profiles. We also identified a SNP within an ERV that seemingly
affects its regulatory activity by altering a TF binding site (Supplementary Figure 4C),
suggesting that genetic variation within ERVs also contributes to inter-individual
differences in ERV activity. Finally, younger ERVs such as LTR5_Hs are structurally
polymorphic within the human population (Belshaw et al., 2005; Thomas et al., 2018),
adding another layer of genetic variation. Regulatory ERVs may therefore foster
genetic, epigenetic and transcriptional heterogeneity of the disease with potential to
contribute to clinical outcomes. One significant consequence of the molecular
heterogeneity of AML is the escape of resistant clones from treatment, resulting in high
relapse rates. It will be therefore interesting to discover to which extent the ERVderived heterogeneity contributes to inter-individual differences in response to AML
therapies.
Altogether, our work reveals the first example of ERVs as oncogenic enhancers in AML
and, more importantly, in any human malignancy. These data highlight the significance
of expanding the search for oncogene drivers to the repetitive part of the genome,
which may pave the way for the development of novel prognostic and therapeutic
approaches.

Methods
Cell culture and cell proliferation assays
293T cells and human leukemia cell lines K562, OCI-AML3, MOLM-13 and HL-60 were
routinely cultured in RPMI 1640 (and DMEM (HEK293T) supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum, 2mM glutamax and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37°C in 5% carbon
dioxide. Cells were maintained and split every 2-3 days.
For cell proliferation assays, exponentially growing cells were plated in 24-well plates
(1x105 cells/ml). Every 2-3 days media were replaced and cells were split to 1x105
cells/ml. The viable cells were counted daily for 6 days.
Cell-cycle and apoptosis assays
Cell cycle assay was performed using muse cell cycle kit by following manufacturers
instructions (Millipore) and the cells were analysed by BD FACS Canto II. For

apoptosis assay, the cells were stained by an annexin V 647 (Thermofisher Scientific)
and DAPI and analysed by BD FACS Canto II.
CRISPR-Cas9-mediated LTR disruption
For CRISPR/Cas9 deletion of LTRs, sgRNA oligonucleotides (Sigma-Aldrich) targeting
upstream and downstream of LTRs of interest were annealed and cloned into modified
eSpCas9 (1.1) vector (Addgene 71814, deposited by Feng Zhang), which expresses
GFP. K562 cells were nucleofected with eSpCas9 plasmid containing gRNAs using
amaxa nucleofector kit V. 2 days later, cells expressing GFP were sorted on a FACS
Aria II and single cells were plated onto a 96-well plate. After 2 weeks, cells were
genotyped by PCR and the gene expression of LTR-knockout cells was analyzed by
RT-qPCR.
For LTR2-APOC1 deletion, 5’ sgRNAs (Sigma-Aldrich) were cloned into lentiCRISPR
v2 (Addgene 52961) and 3’ sgRNAs were cloned into lenti_sgRNA_EFS_GFP
(Addgene 65656) vector. OCI-AML3 and K562 cells were transduced with the lentiviral
vectors containing sgRNAs and selected for GFP and puro. % of WT loci was
determined by qPCR using APOC_R and APOC_I genotyping primers listed in
Supplementary Table 7. The cells were cultured around three weeks for RNA
expression and phenotypical analysis.
CRISPRi-mediated silencing of LTRs
sgRNAs (Sigma-Aldrich) targeting multiple LTR copies were cloned into lentiviral
expression vector pKLV-U6gRNA(BbsI)-PGKpuro2ABFP (Addgene 50946, deposited
by K. Yusa). For LTR silencing, OCI-AML3 and K562 cells were first transduced with
the

lentiviral

vector

pHR-SFFV-KRAB-dCas9-P2A-mCherry (Addgene

60954,

deposited by Jonathan Weissman), sorted for mCherry on a FACSAria II. Cells
expressing mCherry were then subsequently transduced with the lentiviral sgRNA
expression vector. 2 days later, the cells expressing both mCherry and BFP were
sorted and cultured for transcriptional and chromatin analyses.
Lentiviral production and transduction
Lentivirus was produced in HEK 293 T cells by triple transfection with delivery vector
and the packaging plasmids psPAX2 and pMD.G. The viral supernatants were
collected 48 h after transfection and filtered through a 0.45 μM filter. Target cells were
transduced with lentiviral supernatant supplemented with 4 µg/mL polybrene.
RNA Isolation and RT-qPCR
RNA was extracted using AllPrep DNA/RNA mini kit (Qiagen 80204) and DNAse
treated with the TURBO DNA-free™ Kit (Ambion, AM1907). RNA (1 µg) was
retrotranscribed using Revertaid Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Scientific EP0441)

and the cDNA was diluted 1/10 for qPCRs using MESA BLUE MasterMix
(Eurogenentec, 10-SY2X-03+NRWOUB) on a LightCycler® 480 Instrument II (Roche).
A list of primers used can be found in Supplementary Table 7.
RNA-seq Library Preparation
Ribosomal RNA-depleted RNA-seq libraries were prepared from 200-500 ng of total
RNA using the low input ScriptSeq Complete Gold Kit (Epicentre). Libraries were
sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 with single-end 75 bp reads.
Chromatin Immunoprecipitation
Approximately 107 cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 12 minutes in PBS and
quenched with glycine. Chromatin was sonicated using a Bioruptor Pico (Diagenode),
to an average size of 200-700 bp. Immunoprecipitation was performed using 75 µg of
chromatin and 5 µg of Cas9 antibody (Diagenode #C15200229-100) or 15 µg of
chromatin and 2.5 µg of H3K27ac and H3K9me3 antibody (Active Motif #3913,
Diagenode #C15410193). Final DNA purification was performed using the GeneJET
PCR Purification Kit (Thermo Scientific. #K0701) and DNA was eluted in 80 µL of
elution buffer. This was diluted 1/10 and analysed by qPCR, using the KAPA SYBR®
FAST Roche LightCycler® 480 2X qPCR Master Mix (Kapa Biosistems, Cat. KK4611).
A list of primers used can be found in Supplementary Table 7.
Library preparation and sequencing for ChIP-seq and DNase-seq
ChIP-seq and DNase-seq libraries were prepared from 1-5 ng ChIP DNA or DNase
DNA samples using NEBNext Ultra II DNA library Prep Kit (Illumina). Libraries were
sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 with single-end or paired-end 75 bp reads.
Chromatin accessibility assay
To asses chromatin accessibility, DNase I digestion was performed as previously
described (Song and Crawford, 2010). 5 million cells were resuspended in RSB buffer
(10 mM NaCl, 3mM MgCl2, 10mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4). After cell lysis, the nuclei were
digested with DNase I with 0, 0.1, 2, 5, 15 and 30 U for 10 min at 37oC. Digests were
inactivated by the addition of 50 mM EDTA. RNA and proteins were digestion by
RNase A (0.5 mg/ml) for 15 min at at 37°C and then by proteinase K (0.5 mg/ml) for 1
h at 65 oC. DNA was purified by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation.
The resuspended DNA was analysed by qPCR, using the KAPA SYBR® FAST Roche
LightCycler® 480 2X qPCR Master Mix (Kapa Biosistems, Cat. KK4611) and
chromatin digested with 15 U was selected for library preparation and sequencing.
Primary processing of high-throughput sequencing data
Reads from high-throughput sequencing data generated here or from external
datasets (Supplementary Table 8) were trimmed using first trimmed using Trim Galore.
ChIP-seq and DNase-seq data were aligned to the hg38 genome assembly using

Bowtie2 v2.1.0 (Langmead and Salzberg, 2012), followed by filtering of uniquely
mapped reads with a custom script. ChIP-seq peak detection was performed using
MACS2 v2.1.1 (Y. Zhang et al., 2008) with -q 0.05; for histone marks the option --broad
was used. DNase-seq peak detection was performed using F-seq v1.84 (Boyle et al.,
2008) with options -f 0 -t 6. RNA-seq data were mapped using Hisat2 v2.0.5 (Kim et
al., 2019) with option --no-softclip. Raw read counts for each gene were generated in
Seqmonk with the RNA-seq quantitation pipeline, and normalised gene expression
values calculated with the variance stabilizing transformation in DESeq2 (Love et al.,
2014). BigWig tracks were generated using the bamCoverage function of
deepTools2.0, with CPM normalisation and 200 bp bin size. Other processed data from
Blueprint, ENCODE and other sources (Supplementary Table 8) were downloaded as
peak annotations or expression values (e.g., FPKM).
DHS enrichment at repeat families
DHSs (i.e., DNase-seq peaks) were intersected with the Repeatmasker annotation and
the number of overlapped DHSs per repeat family calculated. For comparison, 1000
random controls were generated by shuffling the DHSs in a given sample, avoiding
unmappable regions of the genome. P values were calculated based on the number
of random controls for which the number of DHS overlaps displayed more extreme
values (at either tail of the distribution) than those seen with the real DHSs. Enrichment
values were calculated by dividing the number of real DHS overlaps with the mean
number of DHS overlaps in the random controls. Significantly enriched repeat families
had: 1) p<0.05, 2) >2-fold enrichment, 3) >20 copies overlapped by DHSs. Selected
families were significantly enriched for DHSs in at least one of the cell lines analysed
(HL-60, OCI-AML3, MOLM-13) and in >10% of AML samples.
Mutational profile analysis
A-DAR elements overlapping DHSs in at least one sample were selected, and a
correlation matrix built based on the patterns of DHS overlap between samples. These
were compared with the AML mutational profiles extracted from the respective
publications (Assi et al., 2018; Yi et al., 2019). Correlation coefficients between AML
samples sharing a particular mutation were compared with correlation coefficients
between samples without the mutation.
Identification of active A-DAR promoters
Aligned BAM files from Blueprint RNA-seq data were processed using StringTie
v1.3.3b (Pertea et al., 2015) with options --rf -G to generate sample-specific guided
transcriptome assemblies. Spliced transcripts initiating at A-DAR elements were then
identified by intersecting the TSSs of multi-exon transcripts A-DAR annotations. A-

DAR elements with TSSs in AML samples but not in differentiated cells were selected
and the associated transcripts visually inspected.
K562 TF ChIP-seq analysis
ENCODE TF ChIP-seq peak files from K562 (Supplementary Table 8) were
downloaded and intersected with A-DAR annotations, as well as with a randomly
shuffled version of these elements. TFs significantly enriched (corrected p<0.05) in at
least one of the A-DAR families, covering at least 5% of the elements in that family
were selected. For each TF, average enrichment values were calculated across
technical and biological replicates, as well as independent ChIP-seq experiments of
the same TF.
TF motif analysis
Motif analysis of A-DARs was performed using the AME and FIMO tools of the MEME
SUITE v5.0.1 (Bailey et al., 2015) using the HOCOMOCO v11 human TF motif
database. Motifs enriched in at least one A-DAR family were identified using AME, and
motif frequency and location extracted using FIMO. Consensus sequences were
downloaded from Dfam (Hubley et al., 2016).
CRISPRi ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analyses
Normalised H3K27ac and H3K9me3 ChIP-seq read counts were extracted around
dCas9 peaks (±500 bp from the peak centre). Genes within 50 kb of a dCas9 peak
were considered as putative direct targets of CRISPRi. Differential gene expression
analysis was performed using DEseq2 (Love et al., 2014).
