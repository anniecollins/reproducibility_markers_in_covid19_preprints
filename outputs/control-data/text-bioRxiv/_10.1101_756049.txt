Abstract
Understanding constraints on the functional properties of biomolecular circuit
dynamics, such as the variation of amplitude and timescale of pulse, is an important
part of biomolecular circuit design. While the amplitude-timescale co-variations of
the pulse in an incoherent feedforward loop have been investigated computationally
using mathematical models, experimental support for such constraints is relatively
unclear. Here, we address this using experimental measurements of an existing
pulse generating incoherent feedforward loop circuit realization in the context of
a standard mathematical model. We characterize the trends of co-variation in
the pulse amplitude and rise time computationally by randomly exploring the parameter space. We experimentally measured the co-variation by varying inducers
and found that larger amplitude pulses have slower rise time. We discuss the gap
between the experimental measurements and predictions of the standard model,
highlighting model additions and other biological factors that might bridge the
gap.

Introduction
An examination of the limits to which important functional properties can be varied
provides a design guide for achievable system performance. Examples include the gainbandwidth constraint in electronic amplifiers [1], the Cramer-Rao bound in statistics [2],
and the space-time constraint in software [3]. Investigations in biology from a systems
perspective, particularly in the dynamics of biomolecular circuits, have provided instances
of such constraints, for example, in the robustness and efficiency of glycotic oscillations [4],
responsiveness to noise susceptibility in yeast galactose network [5], the effectiveness and
optimality of generalized homeostasis system [6], and sensitivity and adaptation ability
in feedforward loop [7]. These constraints provide a guide to the limits of achievable
performance in biomolecular circuit dynamics.
Pulses in protein activity (Fig. 1A), in particular, are important dynamics in biomolecular circuits [8]. Both the amplitude of the pulse as well as its duration may be functionally important, for example, in the timescale-based regulatory activity of crz1 in yeast

proteomes [9] and in the pulse amplitude dependent cellular differentiation in Bacillus
subtilis [10]. One way to generate pulses is when a step input is applied to an incoherent
feedforward loop (Fig. 1B). These are a class of biomolecular circuits that are recurring
motifs [11] and have been investigated, both in natural circuits and in synthetic circuits,
in the context of adaptation [12], fold-change detection [13], and scale invariance [14].
In the context of adaptation, it has been found, computationally, that the sensitivity to
input is constrained to be inversely proportional to the adaptation ability [7]. Variations
of these relations have been found in other feedforward loops as well [15]. Finally, we
have previously addressed, also computationally, the quantitative co-variation between
the amplitude and timescale properties for a standard model and noted the different
trends possible [16]. An understanding of such constraints can guide the design space of
pulse generating biomolecular circuits.
There are at least three striking aspects in the dynamics of pulses generated by
biomolecular circuits. First, is the wide prevalence of such dynamics, perhaps reflecting the dynamic environments the cells experience, with more instances of pulsing being
found due to advances in measurement techniques. Second, that both amplitude and
timescale of the pulse may have biological regulatory activity and hence be of functional
importance. Third, these amplitude and timescale properties may be interlinked in that
they may co-vary in response to changes in circuit parameters, rather than be independently tunable properties. Given these, it is important to experimentally investigate the
possible co-variation in amplitude and timescale.
Here we ask whether there is any experimental evidence of constraints in the covariation of the amplitude and timescale properties of a pulse generating circuit (Fig.
1C). To address this, we used experimental measurements of an existing incoherent feedforward loop circuit realization and analysed these in the context of a widely accepted
mathematical model. We randomly sampled the parameter space of the mathematical
model and categorized the co-variations of pulse amplitude and rise time as individual
parameters are varied, finding different trends such as mutual increase and mutual decrease. We experimentally characterized these co-variations using inducers and found
that as the pulse amplitude increased, the rise time always increased providing evidence
for a tradeoff between pulse height and pulse speed. We discuss this disconnect between
the model and experiment, investigating model additions and other possible biological
factors that might underlie the observed behaviour. These results help to understand

the constraints in design of biomolecular pulsing circuits and may also be relevant to
naturally occurring biomolecular circuits that pulse.

Results and Discussion
Parameter space exploration for amplitude-rise time co-variation
We have previously investigated co-variations of amplitude of pulse with respect to the
timescale properties including rise time [16]. We did this using a standard model [17] at a
nominal parameter space by individually varying one parameter at a time (see Methods).
We found that amplitude and rise time can mutually increase as degradation rate of the
output protein increases, and that amplitude can decrease with an increase in rise time
as degradation rate of intermediate protein (x) increases. Further, we found that only
the pulse amplitude, not the timescale properties, change when the production factors
change. These are summarized in Fig. 2A.
To investigate whether these trends persist for other points in the parameter space,
we randomly varied the parameters around the nominal parameter set and, for each of
the points, computed the change in pulse height and the change in rise time as each
parameter is individually perturbed (Fig. 2B). For degradation rate parameter of output
protein y, the points lie in the first quadrant implying that for an increase in pulse height
the rise time also increases. For the degradation rate parameter of intermediate protein
x, the points lie in the second quadrant implying that an increase in pulse height results
in a decrease in rise time. For the production rate of the proteins, the points lie on the
y-axis showing that the amplitude can increase or decrease without altering the rise time.
Therefore, the trends noted earlier persist across these parameter sets as well.
To further study the effect of perturbations to simultaneous multiple parameters, we
randomly perturbed the parameters. The parametric density plot on the amplitude and
rise time space shows a larger density of relatively lower amplitude and faster rise time
(Fig. 2 C).
In summary, we note that for this model, the amplitude of the pulse height can
independently be varied without altering rise time on perturbing production factor of
proteins. The amplitude and rise time vary inversely when degradation rate parameter
of intermediate protein is changed and they vary proportionally when degradation rate
parameter of output protein is changed.
Experimental Evidence of Co-variation
We obtained a previously constructed incoherent feedforward loop circuit (Fig. 3A inset,
Please see Materials) that pulses in response to a step change in arabinose in presence of
anhydrotetracycline (aTc). In this circuit, the transcriptional activator AraC is constitutively produced. The transcriptional repressor TetR is expressed from a AraC-regulated
promoter PBAD , and expression is activated when inducer arabinose is added. A degradation tagged green fluorescent protein (deGFPssrA) is expressed from a combinatorially
regulated promoter; repressed by TetR and activated by AraC (in presence of arabinose).
This is the output of the circuit. The input is a step change in arabinose. It is reported
previously that TetR dominates activation in this circuit [18]. aTc binds to and inactivates TetR, thereby weakening repression. We replicated the pulse with arabinose step

in the presence of aTc (Fig. 3A, Methods). We find a pulse height of 2600 fluorescence
unit and rise time of 75 minutes for 0.2 % arabinose and 1 ng/ml aTc.
We used the inducers to experimentally explore the parameter space in terms of the
properties of the pulse. We repeated the experiment for different arabinose levels at a
fixed aTc level, and for different aTc levels at a fixed arabinose level (Fig. 3B-E). We find
that as arabinose levels increase pulse height increases and rise time increases. Further,
we find that as aTc levels increase, the pulse height increases and rise time increases.
These results shows that for these experimental conditions, there is a constraint that as
the pulse height increases, the rise time increases, making a higher amplitude pulse also
slower (Fig. 3F).
Systematic Model Analysis
While we find, experimentally, that as the pulse height increases, the rise time also
increases, these results do not match the expectations from the standard model considered
above. In the model, an increase in arabinose should change the parameter dissociation
constant of AraC from Ku0 to Ku (Ku > Ku0 ). As this parameter increases, we find the
pulse height decreases and rise time increases (Fig. 4A). This is not seen experimentally.
Similarly, an increase in aTc should change the parameter dissociation constant of T etR
from Kx0 to Kx (Kx0 > Kx ). As this parameter increases, we find the pulse height
increases with no change in the rise time (Fig. 4A). This is also not seen experimentally.
A possible reason for this discrepancy could be the difference in experimental circuit in
relation to the model.
To investigate these discrepancies, we first expand the model to include TetR-aTc
interactions. An assumption used in the standard model is that the repression is strong.

resources needed to produce proteins and other possible dynamics such as host-circuit
interactions or resource competition.

Summary
Understanding constraints in the co-variation of amplitude and timescale in a biomolecular pulsing circuits is important for their design. Using experimental measurements and
mathematical models of a benchmark pulse generating biomolecular circuit — the incoherent feedfoward loop — we address this issue and present three main points. First, we
explore the parameter space of a widely used model of an incoherent feedforward loop
and find global trends for the covariation of amplitude and rise time. Second, we find experimental evidence, that as amplitude of the pulse increases, the rise time also inceases.
Third, we discuss the inconsistencies between the mathematical model and experimental
measurements and ways to resolve these. These results provide experimental evidence
for the existence of constraints in the design space of such pulse generating circuits.

Methods
Materials
The plasmid for feedforward loop is pBEST-OR2-OR1-Pr-araC, pBAD-TetR, pBADTetO1deGFP-ssrA was from plasmids from the lab of Prof. Richard M. Murray (Addgene plasmid # 45789; http://n2t.net/addgene:45789 ; RRID:Addgene 45789). This was transformed into the E. coli MG1655 strain background. The realization is based on transcriptional activator AraC, transcriptional repressor T etR, and reporter deGF P ssrA as
in Fig. 3A. The deGF P ssrA is a green fluorescent protein with ssrA degradation tag
at C-terminal of deGF P protein. The protein AraC is constitutively expressed with
promoter Pr-OR2-OR1. The T etR and deGF P are expressed with promoter PBAD that
can be activated by AraC in presence of arabinose. Additionally, the operator sites for
T etR are fused to a promoter PBAD regulating the deGF P . This allows T etR to repress
the promoter. The circuit plasmid has Ampicillin resistance marker and ColE1 origin
of replication. All these three genes are on the same plasmid. The untranslated region
for all of this is UTR1, which has a strong ribosome binding site. The transcriptional
terminator for all three is called T500. In 5’ to 3’ order, the genes are: pBAD-tetO1 (repressed by TetR)-UTR1-deGFP-ssrA-T500, pBAD-UTR1-TetR-T500, and OR2-OR1-Pr
(bacteriophage lambda with one mutation)-UTR1-araC-T500. The pBAD-TetR insert is
inverted relative to reporter gene.

Measurement Protocol
For experimental measurement, the strain was inoculated in LB media supplemented
with Ampicillin for 16 hours. The culture was subsequently diluted 1:200 in fresh minimal media and LB media supplemented with Ampicillin. The culture was induced with
aT c (1, 2, 4 ng/ml) and incubated for two hours. Next, different levels of arabinose
(0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.04%) was added to the incubated culture and this final culture was used
for plate reader measurement. The measurement was taken for ten hours at 37 ◦ C with

were placed in triplicate and the above protocol was repeated for three days.

Data Analysis
MATLAB was used for data analysis. A blank sample containing only media and no cells
was used as background and subtracted from culture reading for both optical density and
fluorescence.
