SUMMARY
The process of oligodendrogenesis has been relatively well delineated in the rodent brain. However, it
remains unknown whether analogous developmental processes are manifested in the human brain.
Here, we report oligodendrogenesis in forebrain organoids, generated by using OLIG2-GFP knockin
human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) reporter lines. OLIG2/GFP exhibits distinct temporal expression
patterns in ventral forebrain organoids (VFOs) vs. dorsal forebrain organoids (DFOs). Interestingly,
oligodendrogenesis can be induced in both VFOs and DFOs after neuronal maturation. Assembling
VFOs and DFOs to generate fused forebrain organoids (FFOs) promotes oligodendroglia maturation.
Furthermore, dorsally-derived oligodendroglial cells outcompete ventrally-derived oligodendroglia and
become dominant in FFOs after long-term culture. Thus, our organoid models reveal human
oligodendrogenesis with ventral and dorsal origins. These models will serve to study the phenotypic
and functional differences between human ventrally- and dorsally-derived oligodendroglia and to reveal
mechanisms of diseases associated with cortical myelin defects.

INTRODUCTION
Oligodendrocytes (OLs) are the myelinating cells and are the last major type of neural cells formed
during the CNS development (Goldman and Kuypers, 2015; Zhong et al., 2018). Much of our current
knowledge on OL development is obtained from studies in rodents. There are three distinct and
sequential waves of oligodendrogenesis. Starting at embryonic day (E) 12.5, the first wave arises from
NKX2.1-expressing precursors in the medial ganglionic eminence (Tekki-Kessaris et al., 2001). These
oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) migrate tangentially to distant locations and colonize the entire
forebrain (Kessaris et al., 2006; Klambt, 2009). Subsequently, at E15.5, a second wave emerges from
precursors in the lateral and medial ganglionic eminences (Chapman et al., 2013). These OPCs also
migrate to the cortex, dispersing throughout the forebrain (Kessaris et al., 2006; Klambt, 2009). These
ventrally-derived OPCs either remain as OPCs or differentiate into myelinating OLs in the maturing
neocortex (Kessaris et al., 2006; Tripathi et al., 2011). Around birth, a third wave arises dorsally from
precursors expressing the homeobox gene EMX1 in the cortex (Kessaris et al., 2006; Winkler et al.,
2018). Interestingly, these dorsally-derived OPCs migrate locally to populate the cortex and displace
the OPCs from the first two waves that initially colonize the cortical mantle (Kessaris et al., 2006;
Winkler et al., 2018). Although the process of oligodendrogenesis has been well delineated in the
mouse brain, it remains unknown whether analogous developmental processes are manifested in the
human brain, particularly the dorsally-derived third wave of oligodendrogenesis (Jakovcevski et al.,
2009; Rakic and Zecevic, 2003).
The lack of human brain tissue prevents a detailed understanding of human oligodendrogenesis.
Neural specification of human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC), including human embryonic stem cells
(hESCs) and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), offers unprecedented opportunities for
studying human neural development (Avior et al., 2016; Marchetto et al., 2011). While OPCs have been
efficiently derived from hPSC in the 2-dimensional (2D) culture system, these OPCs are mainly derived
from ventral CNS regions by using ventralizing morphogens, such as sonic hedgehog (SHH) (Goldman
and Kuypers, 2015; Tao and Zhang, 2016). Despite the previous progress, the different origins of
human oligodendrogenesis have not been able to be recapitulated in 2D cultures, likely due to the lack
of cell-cell/cell-matrix interactions in these monolayer cultures.
The recent development of 3D cerebral organoids derived from hPSCs offers a promising
approach to understanding human brain development (Pasca, 2018), complementing 2D cell culture
models. In this study, using OLIG2-GFP knockin hPSC reporter lines (Liu et al., 2011), we generated
brain region-specific dorsal forebrain organoids (DFOs) and ventral forebrain organoids (VFOs) by
inhibiting or activating SHH signaling pathway, respectively. We further monitored the temporal
expression of OLIG2 and examined the oligodendrogenesis in these brain region-specific organoids.
Moreover, by assembling DFOs and VFOs to form fused forebrain organoids (FFOs), we found that the
human oligodendroglial differentiation and maturation were significantly promoted.

RESULTS
Distinct expression patterns of OLIG2 in hPSC-derived ventral and dorsal forebrain organoids
To examine the expression of OLIG2 in brain region-specific organoids, we generated human ventral
forebrain organoids (VFOs) and dorsal forebrain organoids (DFOs) using OLIG2-GFP hPSC (hESC
and hiPSC) reporter lines generated in our previous studies (Fig. 1A and B) (Liu et al., 2011; Xue et al.,
2009). Using methods established in recent studies (Bagley et al., 2017; Birey et al., 2017; Xiang et al.,
2017), brain region-specific organoids were derived by either activating or inhibiting the SHH signaling
pathway from week 3 to 5. After one additional week of culturing with neural differentiation (ND)
medium or OPC medium (week 6), both DFOs and VFOs exhibited subventricular/ventricular zone-like
regions containing SOX2+ neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and βIIIT+ immature neurons (Fig. 1C). As
shown in Fig. 1D and E, at week 5, both VFOs and DFOs were composed of a comparable population
of Nestin-positive NPCs and FOXG1-positive forebrain cells. The vast majority of the cells in DFOs
remained to express PAX6, which is also a marker for the NPCs in dorsal brain, whereas the vast
majority of the cells in VFOs expressed NKX2.1, a marker of ventral prosencephalic progenitors. We
further examined the gene expression of markers for dorsal forebrain, including EMX1 and TBR2, and
markers for ventral forebrain, including NKX2.2, DLX1, and LHX6 in both DFOs and VFOs. EMX1 and
TBR2 are expressed by cortical NPCs and intermediate progenitors (Englund et al., 2005; Gorski et al.,
2002). NKX2.2, LHX6, and DLX1 are expressed by the NPCs in the medial ganglionic eminence
(Briscoe et al., 1999; Du et al., 2008; Petryniak et al., 2007). As shown in Fig. 1F, markers for ventral
forebrain, NKX2.2, DLX1, and LHX6, were conspicuously detected in VFOs, whereas markers for
dorsal forebrain, EMX1 and TBR2, were restricted to DFOs. Although DFOs and VFOs were generated
from the same population of PAX6+ pNPCs at week 3 (Fig. 1B), as opposed to week 5 DFOs, nearly all
the cells in week 5 VFOs were NKX2.1+/PAX6- and abundantly expressed NKX2.2, DLX1, and LHX6,
indicating that VFOs undergo ventral forebrain development induced by the activation of the SHH
signaling pathway. Together with the data showing the restricted expression of EMX1 and TBR2 in
DFOs, the observation that week 5 DFOs were highly enriched of PAX6+/NKX2.1- NPCs indicates the
formation of dorsal forebrain regional identity in DFOs. From week 5 to 7, intense GFP signals were
observed in VFOs, whereas a small subset of cells in DFOs was found to express GFP (Fig. 1B and G).
After long-term culture, robust GFP fluorescence in the VFOs became dimmer at week 9 and eventually
was found to distribute evenly in the VFOs at week 12. The weak GFP signals in the DFOs gradually
decreased and became undetectable at week 9. Interestingly, we observed the reappearance of GFP
signals at week 12 (Fig. 1G). Furthermore, we confirmed the OLIG2 expression in DFOs by qRT-PCR.
We consistently found that OLIG2 expression was very low at week 5 and hardly detectable at week 9.
At week 12, the OLIG2 expression significantly increased about 25 fold, compared to its level at week 5
(Fig. 1H).
OLIG2 is cytoplasmically expressed in PAX6+ neural progenitors in week 5 DFOs
GFP signals faithfully mirrored the OLIG2 expression in organoids (Fig. 2A and B). There was a
significantly higher abundance of OLIG2+ cells in VFOs than in DFOs. Notably, unlike the nuclear
localization of OLIG2 in VFOs, GFP+ cells in DFOs exhibited cytoplasmic OLIG2 expression (Fig. 2A
and C). Immunoblot analysis confirmed that OLIG2 was abundantly present in the nuclear fraction of
VFOs, whereas OLIG2 was detected at a low level only in the cytoplasmic fraction of DFOs (Fig. 2D). In
the VFOs, nearly all GFP+ cells expressed NKX2.1 (Fig. 2E). As predicted, virtually no detectable
NKX2.1+ cells in the DFOs (Fig. 1D and E). A subpopulation of GFP+ cells in the DFOs was colocalized
with PAX6 staining (31.0 ± 1.6 % of total GFP+ cells), further indicating the dorsal forebrain identity of
the OLIG2+ cells in the DFOs (Fig. 2E and F). Taken together, OLIG2 is not only expressed in the
VFOs but also cytoplasmically expressed in a small subset of NPCs in the DFOs.
OLIG2+ NPCs with dorsal forebrain regional identity can give rise to glutamatergic neurons

To further examine whether NPCs in the DFOs could differentiate into functional neurons and glial cells,
we performed two-photon Ca2+ imaging on the organoids at week 6. We recorded patterns of Ca2+
transients from soma of total 78 spontaneously active cells collected from randomly selected 5 fields in
2 organoids. The Ca2+ transients exhibited by astrocytes are slower transients whereas the ones
displayed by neurons are faster transients (Ohara et al., 2009; Tashiro et al., 2002). As shown in Fig.
3A and B, based on the duration and the number of oscillations, the patterns of Ca2+ transients could be
grouped into two types: type 1 “glia-like” cells that had a lower number of oscillations with longer
durations (> 10 s) and type 2 “neuron-like” cells that had a higher number of oscillations with shorter
durations (< 2 s). Type 2 “neuron-like” cells also exhibited a significantly higher peak value of Ca2+
transients than type 1 “glia-like” cells (Fig. 3B).
The nuclear localization of OLIG2 suggests differentiation to oligodendroglial lineage cells
(Ligon et al., 2006), whereas cytoplasmic localization suggests differentiation to neuronal or astroglial
cells (Setoguchi and Kondo, 2004; Takebayashi et al., 2000; Zhao et al., 2009). To delineate the
identity of GFP+ cells, we immuno-stained the organoids with astroglial marker S100β or neuronal
marker βIIIT. As shown in Fig. 3C, a large number of βIIIT+ neurons and a small population of S100β+
astrocytes were identified in 6-week-old DFOs. The GFP+ NPCs in DFOs mainly differentiated into
neurons with a small percent giving rise to astroglia (Fig. 3D). In addition, we double-stained the DFOs
with GFP and DCX, a marker for migrating immature neurons (Gleeson et al., 1999), or TBR2, a marker
for intermediate neuronal progenitors (Sessa et al., 2010). There were GFP+/DCX+ processes and
some GFP+ cells were positive for TBR2 (Fig. 3E), further suggesting that these GFP+/OLIG2+ cells
were able to differentiate to neuronal cells.
We also found the formation of glutamatergic synapses in week 7 DFOs, as indicated by the
staining of VGLUT1+ puncta (Fig. 3G). Notably, some of the VGLUT1+ puncta were found to distribute
along the GFP+ processes. This prompted us to further characterize the OLIG2+ cells in the DFOs. We
triple-stained the week 7 DFOs with GFP, βIIIT, and glutaminase (GLS) that is the enzyme essential for
glutamate production in glutamatergic neurons and astrocytes in the brain (Aoki et al., 1991; Cardona
et al., 2015). We found that a small population of GFP+ neurons, marked by βIIIT, expressed GLS (Fig.
3F), suggesting that the OLIG2+/GFP+ cells in the DFOs develop into glutamatergic neurons.
BrainPhys medium promotes neuronal maturation in both VFOs and DFOs
Mounting evidence suggests that neuronal maturation and activity influence oligodendrogenesis and
myelination (Gibson et al., 2014; Mitew et al., 2018). A recent study developed a new BrainPhys
medium to better support the neurophysiological activity of cultured human neurons (Bardy et al., 2015).
We further cultured DFOs and VFOs in the BrainPhys medium from week 7 to 9 (Fig. 4A). Then we
examined the expression of c-Fos, an activity-dependent immediate early gene that is expressed in
neurons following depolarization and often used as a marker for mapping neuronal activity (Loebrich
and Nedivi, 2009). As shown in Fig. 4A and B, at week 9, there were significantly more c-Fos+ cells in
the organoids cultured in BrainPhys medium than in ND medium. Furthermore, we observed that the
synaptic markers, PSD-95 and SYNAPSIN 1 were also expressed in the DFOs cultured in BrainPhys
medium (Fig. 4C). Moreover, neurons expressing CUX1, a marker for superficial-layer cortical neurons
(Nieto et al., 2004) and TBR1+, a marker for pre-plate/deep-layer neurons (Hevner et al., 2001) were
also seen in the DFOs (Fig. 4D). A small population of EMX1+ dorsal NPCs was also found in DFOs
(Fig. 4E and F). At this time point, GFP signals became undetectable in the DFOs. In the VFOs, GFP
fluorescence became much dimmer, compared to week 7 VFOs (Fig. 1G). This may result from the
differentiation of a subset of OLIG2-expressing ventral forebrain NPCs to neurons, particularly
interneurons (Xu et al., 2018), and subsequent termination of OLIG2/GFP expression in those cells, as
reported in previous studies in mice (Miyoshi et al., 2007; Ono et al., 2008).
Human PSC-derived organoids reveal oligodendrogenesis with ventral and dorsal origins
To promote oligodendrogenesis in the DFOs and VFOs, we further cultured the organoids for an
additional 3 weeks (Fig. 4A; week 9 to 12) in OL differentiation medium containing thyroid hormone T3,

which is commonly used to promote OL differentiation from hPSCs under 2D culture conditions
(Goldman and Kuypers, 2015). As shown in Fig. 1G, at week 12, there were a large number of bright
GFP+ cells evenly distributed in the VFOs. In the DFOs, GFP signal reappeared after the treatment of
T3. To characterize the identity of these GFP+ cells, we double-stained GFP with OPC marker
PDGFRα. In both VFOs and DFOs, nearly half of the GFP+ expressed PDGFRα, indicating the
oligodendrogenesis in both organoids (Fig. 4G and H). A subset of PDGFRα+ OPCs in DFOs also
exhibited immunoreactivity for Ki67, suggesting that these OPCs were capable of proliferation (Fig. 4I).
In addition, we also stained the organoids with S100β or βIIIT, but found no GFP+ cells expressing
S100β or βIIIT at week 12. Thus, the GFP+/PDGFRα-negative cells in the organoids might have
committed to oligodendroglial fate but had not yet expressed any OPC marker. To further validate the
ventral vs. dorsal origin of the OPCs in VFOs and DFOs, we examined the expression of tyrosine
kinase B (TRKB). Previous studies (Du et al., 2003) have shown that TRKB is selectively expressed in
oligodendroglia from the basal forebrain that has a ventral origin (Kessaris et al., 2006; Klambt, 2009),
but not in oligodendroglia from cerebral cortex that has a dorsal origin (Kessaris et al., 2006; Winkler et
al., 2018). TRKB was robustly expressed by neurons in both VFOs and DFOs. Only a small population
of TRKB+/GFP+ cells were seen in VFOs but no TRKB+/GFP+ cells in DFOs (Fig. 4J). These results
demonstrate that further culturing VFOs and DFOs under conditions favoring oligodendroglial
differentiation can further reveal oligodendrogenesis with ventral and dorsal origins, respectively.
OL maturation in DFOs, VFOs, and fused forebrain organoids (FFOs)
To examine whether OPCs in these organoids were able to mature into myelinating OLs, we cultured
the VFOs and DFOs in OL medium for up to 6 weeks. Moreover, to test whether the interregional
interactions between the differentially patterned human forebrain organoids are important for OL
maturation, we generated FFOs and further cultured them in OL medium (Fig. 5A). VFOs at week 5
were used for fusion with DFOs because previous studies showed that immature migrating
interneurons generated by ventral forebrain NPCs promote OL formation in the cortex in a paracrine
fashion (Voronova et al., 2017). After fusion, we observed a massive migration of GFP+ cells from the
VFOs into the DFOs (Fig. 5B), similar to the observations reported in previous studies (Bagley et al.,
2017; Birey et al., 2017; Xiang et al., 2017). At 3 weeks after fusion (week 12), GFP+ cells largely
populated the FFOs and exhibited bipolar morphology, characteristics of OPCs (Fig. 5B). At week 15,
we assessed OL maturation in DFOs, VFOs, and FFOs by staining MBP, a marker for mature OLs. As
shown in Fig. 5C and D, MBP+/GFP+ cells were detected in VFOs, but not in DFOs. Interestingly, fusing
the organoids significantly promoted the maturation of OLs, as indicated by a higher percent of
MBP+/GFP+ cells in FFOs. The mature OLs in FFOs exhibited complex processes at week 12 and
occasionally, we observed tubular-shaped MBP staining in FFOs at week 15 (Fig. 5E), suggesting that
the OLs started to myelinate axons. We further examined myelin ultrastructure in 8 sections from 4
FFOs. In total, we identified 52 myelinated axons. As shown in Fig. 5F, axons with loose escheatment
by a few myelin laminae and some axons with compact myelin were observed in week 15 FFOs, which
is similar to the “unorganized” myelin structure observed in oligocortical spheroids in a recent study
(Madhavan et al., 2018) and also partly resembles the earliest stage of in vivo fetal myelinogenesis in
humans (Weidenheim et al., 1992).
We next examined the gene expression of markers for excitatory and inhibitory neurons as well
as markers for inhibitory and excitatory synapses in VFOs, DFOs, and FFOs. As shown in Fig. 5G, the
genes for markers of inhibitory neurons, including SLC6A1 and GAD1 that respectively encode GABA
transporter type 1 and glutamate decarboxylase 1, were expressed at much higher levels in VFOs than
in DFOs. In contrast, genes for markers of excitatory neurons, including SLC17A7 and SLC17A6 that
respectively encode vesicular glutamate transporters VGLUT1 and VGLUT2, were expressed at higher
levels in DFOs than in VFOs. Importantly, FFOs exhibited well-balanced expression of all these gene
transcripts, as compared to DFOs and VFOs. FFOs exhibited not only significantly enhanced
expression of markers for inhibitory neurons, compared to DFOs, but also enhanced expression of
markers for excitatory neurons, compared to VFOs. Furthermore, we examined the expression of

genes for components of post-synaptic machinery, such as HOMER1 and SHANK3 that respectively
encode excitatory postsynaptic components HOMER and SHANK; and ARHGEF9 and GPHN that
respectively encode inhibitory postsynaptic components COLLYBISTIN and GEPHYRIN. Compared to
DFOs and VFOs, FFOs exhibited significantly enhanced expression of the genes for components of
both inhibitory and excitatory postsynaptic. The expression of genes for inhibitory postsynaptic
components was higher in VFOs than in DFOs, and the expression of genes for excitatory postsynaptic
components was similar in VFOs and DFOs. These findings demonstrate that the FFOs generated in
our study possess integrated glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons, and have enhanced expression of
synaptic markers, consistent with the results reported in recent studies (Birey et al., 2017; Xiang et al.,
2017). Notably, the expression of MBP gene was also significantly higher in FFOs than in DFOs or
VFOs. PDGFRα gene was expressed at a similar level in FFOs and VFOs, but at a lower level in DFOs.
Our obervation suggests that enhanced neuronal network in our organoids might contribute to OL
differentiation and maturation.
Dorsally-derived oligodendroglia outcompete ventrally-derived oligodendroglia in the FFOs
To further examine which population of oligodendroglia constituted the oligodendroglial cells in FFOs,
we generated a new version of fused forebrain organoids, by fusing the VFOs and DFOs that were
respectively derived from isogenic OLIG2-GFP hiPSC reporter line and ND2.0 hiPSCs that do not have
any reporter fluorescence (Fig. 6A). The isogenicity of OLIG2-GFP hiPSCs and ND2.0 hiPSCs were
indicated by the identical short tandem repeat (STR) genotyping profile (Supplementary Table 1). In
addition, we did not observe any growth advantage on one line versus the other between the two iPSC
lines. Then we examined the interactions between ventrally- and dorsally-derived oligodendroglia in
those FFOs. Since OLIG2 is expressed in all oligodendroglial lineage cells (Ligon et al., 2006), in this
setting, dorsally- and ventrally-derived oligodendroglia could be readily distinguished because the
former would be GFP-negative/OLIG2+, whereas the latter would be GFP+/OLIG2+. As shown in Fig. 6B
and C, at one week after fusion (week 10), the ventrally-derived GFP+/OLIG2+ cells outnumbered the
dorsally-derived GFP-negative/OLIG2+ cells. At 3 and 6 weeks after fusion (week 12 and 15), the
dorsally-derived GFP-negative/OLIG2+ cells became a dominant population, whereas the ventrallyderived GFP+/OLIG2+ cells dramatically decreased in the FFOs from week 10 to 15 (Fig. 6B and C).
Furthermore, at week 12, the majority of MBP+ cells were MBP+/GFP-negative (Fig. 6D and E),
suggesting that those mature OLs had a dorsal origin. Taken together, these results demonstrate that
the majority of oligodendroglia in the FFO at an early stage (week 10) are ventrally-derived
oligodendroglia, which are outcompeted by dorsally-derived oligodendroglia in the FFOs at later stages
(week 12 and 15).

DISCUSSION
OLIG2 is not only closely associated with the development of OLs in the vertebrate CNS, but also is
expressed in NPCs during development (Jiang et al., 2013; Ligon et al., 2006; Meijer et al., 2012; Ono
et al., 2008). At early embryonic stages in mice, OLIG2 is mostly expressed in the brain by the NPCs
that distribute in the ventral telencephalon (Ligon et al., 2006; Meijer et al., 2012). A distinct but small
number of OLIG2+ NPCs that distribute in the dorsal forebrain has been also identified in both mouse
and human embryonic brain (Jakovcevski and Zecevic, 2005; Ono et al., 2008). The small population of
human OLIG2+/PAX6+ NPCs seen in the week 5 DFOs may mimic the OLIG2+ NPCs in the human
embryonic diencephalon (Jakovcevski and Zecevic, 2005). Furthermore, we demonstrate that these
early human OLIG2+ NPCs are also able to give rise to glutamatergic neurons and astrocytes in the
organoids, similar to that seen in the mouse brain (Ono et al., 2008).
Interestingly, we revealed oligodendrogenesis with a dorsal origin in our organoid models. This
oligodendrogenesis in DFOs likely recapitulates the 3rd wave of oligodendrogenesis because: First,
these oligodendroglial cells are dorsally-derived. The DFOs are generated by using primitive NPCs
(pNPCs) as the starting population, since these neural fate-restricted pNPCs retain high
responsiveness to instructive neural patterning cues (Li et al., 2011) and can be efficiently patterned to
desired brain regions (Monzel et al., 2017). We further enhanced the dorsalization using CycA (Bagley
et al., 2017; Vazin et al., 2014). In addition, we did not observe any ventral forebrain NPCs in DFOs.
Second, these oligodendroglial cells are derived from progenitors that are distinct from the early
OLIG2+/PAX6+ progenitor cells. At week 9, all OLIG2+/PAX6+ NPCs differentiate to neurons or
astrocytes, and OLIG2 expression terminates as indicated by GFP fluorescence and qPCR results.
Moreover, we find EMX1+ dorsal forebrain NPCs in the 9-week-old organoids. It is very likely that those
EMX1+ cells further differentiate to oligodendroglial cells, similar to the findings in the mouse brain
(Kessaris et al., 2006; Winkler et al., 2018). Third, the newly emerged OLIG2+/PDGFRα+ cells in week
12 DFOs are able to proliferate and populate the organoids, indicating their OPC nature. Lastly, these
dorsally-derived oligodendroglia can outcompete ventrally-derived oligodendroglia in the FFOs, which
may mimic the process of oligodendrogenesis in the cerebral cortex, where ventrally derived
oligodendroglia are outcompeted by oligodendroglia with a dorsal origin at late developmental stages
(Kessaris et al., 2006). Thus, these results suggest that a dorsal origin of oligodendrogenesis may
occur during human brain development.
Technically, we also develop organoid models with significantly accelerated OL maturation.
Deriving mature OLs from human PSCs is a tedious and lengthy process, and optimizing methods to
obtain human mature OLs has been a major research effort (Douvaras and Fossati, 2015; Goldman
and Kuypers, 2015; Liu et al., 2011; Stacpoole et al., 2013). In our system, MBP+ mature OLs appeared
at 9 weeks after organoid formation. This acceleration of the OL maturation program in our organoids is
likely achieved by promoting neuronal maturation with the newly-designed BrainPhys medium and
rebuilding the neuronal network in FFOs. Balanced excitatory and inhibitory neuronal activities (Nagy et
al., 2017), neurotransmitters and neurotrophins released by excitatory neurons or astrocytes (Gautier et
al., 2015; Lundgaard et al., 2013; Xiao et al., 2009), as well as cytokines released by young migrating
inhibitory neurons (Voronova et al., 2017) may partly contribute to the enhanced oligodendroglial
lineage progression in FFOs. As compared to the fusion methods, generating a single, regionalized
organoids containing both ventral and dorsal elements (Cederquist et al., 2019) may more precisely
recapitulate the serial waves of oligodendroglial production and replacement seen in the developing
forebrain, because the different germinal zones within single organoids might be well preserved and not
be disrupted by the fusion process. Notably, similar to the recent studies (Madhavan et al., 2018;
Marton et al., 2019), the maturation of human OPCs is not efficient in organoids, and those myelinated
axons often show wrapping with multiple layers of uncompacted myelin. This may be attributed in part
to a lack of oxygen penetration in the organoids cultured for long-term, which can result in necrosis in
the core of organoids (Brawner et al., 2017; Giandomenico and Lancaster, 2017). As opposed to rodent
OPCs, human OPC differentiation and myelination are highly sensitive to hypoxic conditions (Gautier et

al., 2015). Future studies aiming at integrating a vascular structure that brings the adequate delivery of
oxygen and nutrients and promoting neuronal maturation and electrical activity (Brawner et al., 2017;
Mansour et al., 2018) may help facilitate organoid models with robust OL maturation.
Previous in vivo studies have helped us understand the developmental differences between
ventrally- and dorsally-derived OPCs (Kessaris et al., 2006; Nery et al., 2001; Orentas et al., 1999;
Winkler et al., 2018). However, it is largely unclear what the phenotypic and functional differences are
between the different populations of OPCs. In this study, we demonstrate the generation of dorsallyand ventrally-derived human oligodendroglial cells in organoids. We propose that the competitive
advantage exhibited by dorsally-derived over ventrally-derived OPCs may partly result from their unique
expression pattern of molecules involved in controlling OPC proliferation and lineage progression, for
example GPR17, a G-protein-coupled membrane receptor suggested as an intrinsic timer of OL
differentiation during development (Chen et al., 2009; Fumagalli et al., 2011), and transcription factor
EB (TFEB), which recently has been identified to govern the regional and temporal specificity of OL
differentiation and myelination (Sun et al., 2018). Future gene expression profiling at a single-cell level
in the separate dorsal and ventral forebrain organoids as well as FFOs will significantly advance our
understanding on the heterogeneity of human OPCs. Combing with human iPSC technologies,
examining oligodendroglia in region-specific organoids may be more informative to understand disease
mechanisms of neurodevelopmental disorders associated with myelin defects. These organoid models
could also have important implications in the setting of CNS injury, as distinct populations of human
OPCs might respond to pro-myelinating drugs differently, preferentially contributing to remyelination,
thus enabling a better model for therapeutic manipulation.
