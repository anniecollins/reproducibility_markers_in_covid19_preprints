Abstract
Contrast-enhanced ultrasound with microbubbles has shown promise in detection of prostate
cancer (PCa), but sensitivity and specificity of detection remain challenging. Targeted nanoscale
contrast agents with improved capability to accumulate in tumors may result in prolonged signal
enhancement and improved detection of PCa with ultrasound. Here we report on a new nanobubble
contrast agent that specifically targets prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) overexpressed in
most prostate tumors. The PSMA-targeted bubbles (PSMA-NB) were utilized to simultaneously
image dual flank PCa tumors (PSMA-positive PC3pip and PSMA-negative PC3flu) to examine
whether the biomarker can be successfully detected and imaged using this probe in a mouse model.
Results demonstrate that active targeting of NBs to PSMA rapidly and selectively enhances tumor
accumulation and is critical for tumor retention of the contrast agent. Importantly, these processes
could be visualized and quantified, in real time, with standard clinical ultrasound. Such
demonstration of the immense yet underutilized potential of ultrasound in the area of molecular
imaging can open the door to future opportunities for improving sensitivity and specificity of cancer
detection using parametric NB-enhanced ultrasound imaging.

Despite significant efforts, prostate cancer (PCa) is still the second most common leading
cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with 180,000 new cases diagnosed in the USA in 201812

. Accurate diagnosis of PCa is a crucial step necessary for informing the clinical management of

the disease, yet conventional options leave much space for improvement. Currently, men with an
abnormal digital rectal exam and/or increased levels of prostate serum antigen (PSA) are
considered at high risk for cancer and are referred for a prostate biopsy to assess if PCa is present.
The standard PCa biopsy procedure uses transrectal ultrasound (US) guidance to determine the
prostate gland orientation, but the delineation of tumors within the prostate using US is unclear.
Accordingly, biopsies are performed in a systematic manner by selecting 6-12 or more area from
the peripheral zone of the prostate. These cores represent only 1% of prostate tissue and are a gross
under sampling of prostate gland tissue, and biopsies performed using this conventional procedure
result in significant false negatives of up to 50%3-5. Concern over the lack of pathological data in

the face of other positive clinical risk factors results in almost 50% of patients undergoing second,
if not third and fourth, prostate biopsies leading to increased costs and risk associated with
unnecessary procedures. If the already-on board US technology can be used to more reliably
identify the location of prostate cancer within the prostate gland, these outcomes stand to be
significantly improved.
Contrast-enhanced ultrasound has been investigated as one option for improved PCa
detection6-7. In order to increase the PCa detection rate while limiting the number of biopsy
procedures, significant effort has been focused on formulation of lipid and/or protein-stabilized
gas filled contrast agents to improve the US imaging capability of cancer within the prostate8-10.
Most of these efforts have utilized micron-sized contrast agents or microbubbles (MBs)9, 11-12,
which are already clinically utilized for other applications, but these have lacked specificity and
sensitivity over conventional methods. One option to improve these parameters is molecular
targeting of microbubbles to vascular biomarkers. One example of this approach currently in
clinical trials is BR55 (Bracco, Geneva, Switzerland) 13-15, which is targeted to vascular endothelial
growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2). BR55 was examined recently in a phase 0 study for its ability
to detect PCa16. The reported detection of malignant lesions with BR55 was 68%. {Smeenge, 2017
#42}. Two factors may confound the use of MBs for this application. The first is their large
footprint, which confines MBs to the blood stream, and makes consistent targeting and retention
at vascular markers. It also makes most biomarkers for PCa and other cancer inaccessible, since
most lie beyond the vasculature in the tumor parenchyma. Second, MBs have a short lifespan
(typically < 10 min) in the circulation, making their utility limited during targeting and during the
entire biopsy procedure.
These unmet needs have led to increased interest in nano-sized US contrast agents that can
penetrate the tumor parenchyma, bind to cancers, and exhibit nonlinear contrast behavior similar
to MBs18-23. Our group has recently developed an ultrastable nanobubble contrast agent (NB) that
contains perfluoropropane inside a propylene glycol and glycerol-enhanced lipid shell, which
demonstrated unique physicochemical properties and an extended life span in vivo24. These NBs
should have the ability to pass though hyper-permeable vasculature in tumors25-27. Furthermore,
active targeting to a biomarker overexpressed on prostate cancer should enhance the retention of
administered NBs at the tumor site, thus facilitating enhanced molecular contrast imaging in the

tumor. A well-known biomarker for PCa is the prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA)28-30.
PSMA is a type II integral membrane protein that is expressed at lower levels in the healthy
prostate and other organs such as the kidney, liver, and brain, but significantly at higher levels in
PCa31-32. The level of PSMA has a positive correlation with the pathological phase of the tumor
stage33-35 and is also considered to be the most important protein target in diagnostic specific
immunolocalization imaging and immune-directed therapy31,

33, 36

. Many ligands specific to

PSMA are available, including monoclonal and engineered antibodies, small sized molecules,
nanobodies, and aptamers9-10
In the current study, we demonstrate the use of standard nonlinear contrast-enhanced US
for real-time molecular imaging of PCa by targeting stable NBs to PSMA via the PSMA-1ligand,
which has been previously validated as a robust marker for PCa37-38 (Fig. 1a). Our data
demonstrate significant, sustained differences between the kinetics of PSMA-NB, NB and MB in
PCa models. Specifically, the PSMA-NBs were rapidly taken up by the PSMA-expressing tumors
and were selectively retained within the tumor parenchyma, significantly extending duration the
signal available for US visualization compared to untargeted NBs and the commercially available
MB, Lumason®. No differences were seen in the PSMA-negative tumors or kidneys between NBs
and PSMA-NBs, suggesting that the observed retention is due to specific molecular targeting to
PSMA in the tumor itself. Notably, since clinical US was consistently capable of distinguishing
these kinetic differences in small tumors, the work lays the foundation for future work utilizing
the technique in real-time US biopsy guidance.

Results
Validation and Characterization of PSMA Targeted NB
The conjugation of PSMA-1 to lipids was confirmed by the HPLC and the MALDI-TOFMS techniques (Supplementary Fig. 1.a, b). HPLC data showed that the PSMA-1 peak
disappeared after conjugating PSMA-1 with DSPE lipid. MALDI-TOF-MS results further
confirmed the conjugation of PSMA-1 to the DSPE lipid. The preparation and characterization of
base ultrastable NBs has been reported elsewhere24. Briefly, the NB hydrodynamic diameter and
concentration were characterized using resonant mass measurement (RMM) capable of detecting
both buoyant (bubbles) and non-buoyant particles (liposomes, micelles, lipid debris, etc.). The
RMM technology operates by measuring the change in the frequency of oscillation of particles
that flow through an oscillating cantilever24, 39-41. The size and the concentration of PSMA-NB

were 277±11 nm and 3.9E11 ±2.82E10 NBs/ml respectively. The mean size and the concentration
did not change significantly after DSPE-PSMA was incorporated into the NBs (Fig.1b and Fig.
1c). Apart from gas filled bubbles, we also detected non-buoyant particles in both bubble solutions,
which are invisible under US, but may contribute to the bubble overall stability42 (Fig. 1b). The
slightly negative values of zeta potential crucial to the stability of both targeted and untargeted NB
(Fig. 1c) were also confirmed using DLS measurement.

In vitro cellular uptake studies
To optimize the amount of PSMA-1 ligand on the surface of NBs, bubbles with different
amounts of PSMA-1 ligand were prepared, and labeled with Rhodamine B. The highest
fluorescence was found in NBs labeled with reactions that contained 25 µg (35x103 PSMA
molecules per NB) of PSMA-1, followed by NBs with 50 µg (70x103 PSMA molecules per NB)
of PSMA-1, then decreased significantly in NBs with 100 µg (14x104 PSMA molecules per NB)
of PSMA-1 (Supplementary Fig. 2a, b). Our results concurred with other reports that best
targeting was observed in nanoparticles with intermediate number of ligands per nanoparticle43.
After the optimal ligand density was established, we then compared the cellular uptake of
Rhodamine-PSMA-NB in PSMA-positive (PC3pip) cells and PSMA-negative (PC3flu) cells as
shown in Fig. 2a. When cells were exposed to Rhodamine-NB, similar fluorescence intensity was
observed in PC3pip and PC3flu cells. When PC3flu cells were exposed to Rhodamine-PSMA-NB,
the fluorescent intensity was not significantly different compared to cells exposed to RhodamineNB (Fig. 2b). In contrast, the signal increased dramatically in PC3pip cells (~10 fold increased),
which express PSMA, when treated with Rhodamine-PSMA-NB, indicating that PSMA-NBs
selectively bind to PSMA-expressing cells.

In vivo ultrasound imaging
In vivo experiments examining the kinetics of targeted PSMA-NB and NB were performed
using clinical nonlinear contrast enhanced ultrasound and the average results from 7 mice are
reported (Fig. 3.). Five quantitative parameters related to perfusion and bubble dispersion were
extracted from the acquired time-intensity-curves (TIC). These include peak intensity, time to
peak, the duration of contrast enhancement, and area under the curve. The parameters were
compared between PSMA-NB and NB in the PSMA- positive PC3pip and PSMA- negative PC3flu
tumors. Additional comparison was made with the commercially available microbubble,
Lumason®.

Figure 3. PSMA-NB enabled imaging of prolonged enhanced US signal in PSMA-positive PC3pip tumors.
(a) Representative US imaging results of the targeted PSMA-NB, NB and Lumason® in PC3pip tumor,
PC3flu tumor and kidneys. Bubbles were administered via tail vein and both PC3pip and PC3flu tumors
and kidneys were imaged at 12 MHz, 245 kPa pressure, and 0.2 frames per second for 30 min. Left two
columns show the B-mode and contrast harmonic imaging (CHI) mode images of tumors and kidneys
before injection. The series of images shows the CHI images at different time point after bubble
administration. At the peak intensity, the contrast in both PC3pip and PC3flu tumors was similar with both
NB and PSMA-NB. At later time points PC3pip tumor show high contrast with PSMA-NB. (b) Mean time
intensity curves (TIC) of PC3pip tumors, PC3flu tumors, and kidneys after IV bubble administration. The
TIC data was collected from uniform regions of interest drawn on the acquired image stacks.

Both PC3pip and PC3flu tumors and kidneys were localized in the same field of view
(FOV) using ultrasound B-mode imaging. Before bubble injection, tumors and kidneys are not
visible under ultrasound in the nonlinear contrast harmonic imaging (CHI) mode (Fig. 3a). A total
of 200 µl of undiluted NB (~8 x 1010 PSMA-NB or NB) were injected through the tail vein, and
continuous contrast mode US was performed to visualize the bubble dynamic in the tumors and
the kidney. Rapid enhancement of the contrast was observed first in the kidneys followed by both
tumors approximately 30 sec to 2 min post-injection. The time to peak for PSMA-NB in the
PC3pip tumor was slightly longer but it is not significantly different compared to that of PSMANB in PC3flu, (Supplementary Fig. 3a; 3.97 ± 1.20 min compared to 2.75 ± 1.31 min, P = 0.09).

Furthermore, there was no significant difference between the time to peak for NB in either PC3pip
or PC3flu tumor (P = 0.21). The average peak intensity was measured to be 15.64 ± 0.42 dB for
PSMA-NB and NB in the PC3pip and PC3flu tumors and it is not significantly different in each
case (Supplementary Fig. 3b). The NB accumulation was compared and validated using clinically
available MB- Lumason®. The peak intensities obtained for PSMA-NB (15.96 ± 1.83 dB) and NB
(15.60 ± 2.53 dB) were significantly different from the one observed with the Lumason® (7.38 ±
0.33 dB, p < 0.001). Also, the duration of signal enhancement with Lumason® was limited to < 5
min indicating low stability and low circulation time of Lumason® MB in the blood stream.
Table 1 shows the quantitative parameters obtained from the time intensity curves,
including peak enhancement, time to peak, area under the curve (AUC), and 25% of the maximum
peak. Importantly, the AUC was calculated for wash in (WiAUC) and wash out (WoAUC) phases
separately, since the main differences in bubble dynamics were expected during the washout phase.
The total AUC is shown in Supplementary Fig. 3c. The WiAUC for all cases were consistent,
however, the WoAUC of PSMA-NB in PC3pip tumor showed a significant, 2-fold increase,
compared to all other groups (Supplementary Fig. 3d; p < 0.001). Since the TIC are similar in all
cases at the early time points, but deviate at the later time points, the half peak maximum or the
half time of peak intensity (t50%) was also similar between groups (data not shown). However, the
time to reach 25% of the maximum peak intensity (t75%) for PSMA-NB in PC3pip tumor was 2fold longer than all other groups (p < 0.01) (Table 1). These results indicated prolonged retention
of targeted NB in PSMA-expressing tumors.

To further clarify the effect that active nanobubble targeting on tumor accumulation, the
signal from PSMA-NB was normalized to the signal from NB in both PC3pip and PC3flu tumors
at selected time points. This was enabled by the fact that each mouse in the cohort received a
randomized injection of both targeted and untargeted NBs. Thus, we can compare the effect of
targeting, and of target expression in tissue, in addition to any unrelated confounding effects that
may result from surface functionalization of the bubbles. Fig. 4a shows a significantly higher ratio
(>2) at t = 15 min post-injection of bubbles in PC3pip tumor compared to the PC3flu tumor and
was significantly different at each time point. The high ratio persisted, and in fact continued to
increase, for up to 30 min. To minimize the effect of the variability in tumors between animal to
animal, the signal from each bubble in both tumors was also normalized to the kidney signal of the
same animal at each time points. The kidney represents “normal tissue” where no extravascular
accumulation of the NBs would be expected. Fig. 4b again revealed consistently increasing signal
only in the PSMA-NB in the PC3pip tumors. These bubbles showed >2-fold high normalized
signal compared to that of all the other groups at the study endpoint.
No significant differences were noted between PSMA-NB and NB groups for the time to
peak, peak max, WiAUC in kidneys. Although the AUC in kidney with PSMA-NB injection was
higher compared to the NB group, there is no significant difference between the two types of NBs
(Supplementary Fig. 3c). Moreover, in the kidneys there was no significant difference in t50 % or
t75% values between PSMA-NB and NB (data not shown).

from PSMA-NB normalized to the signal from NB at each time point. (b) US signal obtained from PSMANB or NB normalized to the same bubble signal in kidney at each time point.

Histology
To further validate that PSMA-targeted NB can extravasate into the tumor matrix, the
bubbles were tagged with a fluorescent dye; Cy5.5, and injected via tail vein. Twenty-five min
post-injection, the anesthetized animal was euthanized using cardiac perfusion with saline to
remove all blood and concurrently all circulating bubbles. The tumors and kidneys were harvested
for histological analysis. In animals harboring the PC3pip tumors, the Cy5.5-PSMA-NB signal
can be seen deep in the tissue, distally from the microvasculature, providing strong evidence that
the targeted NBs extravasate from the vasculature and enter the tumor interstitial space (Fig. 5a).
The Cy5.5-PSMA-NB signal in PC3pip tumor was significantly higher (5.4 fold) compared to
retained signal in tumors that did not express PSMA, PC3flu tumor (P < 0.001) (Fig.5b). Likewise,
non-targeted Cy5.5-NB had low accumulation in both PC3pip and PC3flu tumors, which was
comparable to targeted NB levels in the PC3flu tumors after perfusion. We noted no significant
histological differences of vasculature between both types of tumors when sections were stained

with anti-CD-31 (Fig 5b). Quantification of the Cy5.5 labeled bubbles revealed that the targeted
bubbles showed 5-fold more accumulation and localization with the CD31 stained vasculature in
the PC3pip compared to PC3flu tumors (Fig 5d). The overexpression of the PSMA in the PC3pip
cells was confirmed by immunohistochemistry results (Fig. 5 c, e; 63.66± 1.51 vs 1.83± 0.15).

Discussion
Currently, PCa biopsies often provide false negative results. Consequently, there is a
critical need for improved tools for PCa detection that can be used to better inform biopsy
procedures. A wide range of imaging approaches is being examined to fill this unmet need, with
MRI-guided biopsies and MRI preplanning showing the most promise44-49. Multiparametric MRI
(mpMRI) and MRI-guided in gantry biopsies have been used in the clinic, and some sites have
shown that the rate of PCa detection with these procedures is improved compared to transrectal
US-guided biopsies45-49. However, MRI-based exams and procedures still present a number of
challenges for broad adoption: they are not widely available, they are not portable and have a
confined working space, and they require additional expertise outside of urology (e.g. radiology).
The procedures can also be quite expensive and add significant time and cost to the diagnostic
workflow. Finally, the negative predictive value (the ability to confidently state that a patient is
malignancy-free), while hugely beneficial, has not been shown to be effective at this point with
MRI 50-51.
A large body of work has instead focused on use of contrast enhanced US that are capable
of molecular level imaging for this application. However, due to the rapid dissipation of
encapsulated gas that causes a rapid signal decay, MB have a short in vivo half-life, which is not
subtle enough to delineate pathological tissues from surrounding normal tissues for US-guided
biopsies. Currently, the most promising MB tool is BR55, which targets VEGFR214-15, 52, as
discussed above, also has comparatively low specificity and sensitivity. While MBs are useful for
visualizing vascular targets, they are restricted to the blood pool. In contrast, nano-sized particles
may be able to penetrate leaky tumor vasculature to reach tissue targets located outside of vessels.
In order to achieve sufficient dosage to gain a predominant signal at the target, the nanoparticles
should outflow from the physical and biological barriers in the body, such as renal clearance, etc5355

. Formulation of NBs with a robust and resilient shell has prolonged their circulating time in

vivo24. In the current study, in order to achieve specific US molecular imaging, the NBs were
targeted to PSMA, which is expressed in high level in both androgen-dependent PCa and
androgen-independent PCa, and a common target for PCa US imaging9-10. Consequently, PSMA1 tagged NBs open an avenue for specific imaging at a molecular level in the tumor environment.

Bubble diameter and concentration obtained using resonant mass measurement indicated
that both NB and the PSMA-NB are in nanoscale (< 300 nm) range and have a concentration
several orders of magnitude higher than commercial MB agents. The small size and high shell
deformability facilitated by inclusion of the edge activator, propylene glycol56 may enable NBs to
pass through the neovasculature

57-58

. The in vitro cell uptake studies provided the optimum

concentration of PSMA-1 that can be incorporated into the NBs to achieve peak uptake. The
optimum ligand density obtained (35 x 103 ligands per NB) concurred with the reported values43.
Cell uptake studies also demonstrated selectivity of binding of PSMA-NBs to the PSMA-positive
PC3pip tumor cells.
In the in vivo acoustic evaluation, the nondestructive low mechanical index (MI = 0.1) was
used to construct TIC and the parametric dynamic CEUS imaging was used to derive the contrast
kinetics. Most importantly, this data demonstrates selective uptake of PSMA-NB in PSMApositive PC3pip tumors compared to the PSMA-negative PC3flu tumors. In comparing the
contribution of active targeting to this behavior it was crucial to also examine untargeted NB in
the same tumors, thus mice received a randomized injection of these bubbles in the same exam,
either before or after PSMA-NB administration. We observed that the time to peak and maximum
peak enhancement were similar in both groups, signifying the similar dynamic of PSMA-NB and
NB in the blood stream and also comparable morphology and vasculature in both PC3pip and
PC3flu tumors. In stark contrast, the washout was slower with PSMA-NB in the PC3pip tumor
compared to all other groups, as shown by persistent enhancement over 30 min, 2-fold higher
WoAUC and t75% . Preferential accumulation of PSMA-NB in the PSMA expressing tumors was
noticeable as early as 10 min after injection and increased over time. This is a considerable
improvement over the relatively small and transient differences noted in prior studies of PSMAtargeted contrast agents9-10. Lumason® MB exhibited significant rapid enhancement in the kidney
and relatively minor enhancement in tumors, and were cleared from the circulation rapidly without
any significant binding. The high tumor to kidney signal ratio with PSMA-NB in PC3pip tumor
also supports the conclusion that targeted NBs accumulate in PSMA-expressing tumors. However,
to fully elucidate the fate of NB in the tumor tissue, a 3D imaging modality will be more
informative compared to 2D imaging; these studies are currently ongoing.

Histological findings confirm the PSMA targeted NB can specifically recognize the tumors
with PSMA expression. The percentage of PSMA-NB in PC3pip tumor is approximately 6-fold
higher than that in PC3flu tumor. There bubbles were previously shown to also be intact and
capable of generating acoustic activity, even following tumor perfusion59. The data also revealed
that PSMA appears to be present in the tumor vasculature, which is a well-documented
phenomenon for many tumors including some prostate cancers60. Concurrent with this we
observed signal from PSMA-NB in the neovasculature in some PC3pip tumors even after the
whole body perfusion of the animal (data not shown). Moreover, the histology data showed an
increase of PSMA-NB accumulation in kidneys. While absolute levels were small, the PSMA-NB
signal in the kidney was on average 6-fold higher compared to the NB signal (Supplementary
Fig. 4a, b). Notably, we observed positive signal from PSMA in kidney, yet approximately 30%
lower compared to the PC3pip tumor (Supplementary Fig. 4c).

Despite this unexpected

expression, the kidney normalized data in Fig 4b above shows increasing enhancement in the
PC3pip tumors over 30 min, indicating that the affinity, biding and retention of PSMA-NBs in
tumors is considerable.
Conclusion
The prolonged persistence of US signal of PSMA-NB in PCa provides exciting future
opportunities to facilitate improved PCa detection with multiparametric contrast-enhanced
ultrasound. The same principles can also make real-time PCa biopsies with US guidance a reality
in the future. Additional studies are ongoing to also examine in detail extravasation of nanobubbles
in tumors and quantify their acoustic activity following extravasation. Furthermore, in depth
studies will elucidate the capability of PSMA-NB in delineating PCa using orthotropic PCa in
mouse and larger animal models with the eventual goal of clinical translation into a rapid real-time
biopsy guidance strategy.

Methods
Preparation of contrast agents. Lipid solution (10 mg/mL) for nanobubbles was prepared by first
dissolving 1,2-dibehenoyl-snglycero-3-phosphocholine (C22, Avanti Polar Lipids Inc., Pelham, AL), 1,2
Dipalmitoyl-sn-Glycero-3-Phosphate (DPPA, Corden Pharma, Switzerland), 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3phosphoethanolamine (DPPE, Corden Pharma, Switzerland), and 1,2- distearoyl-snglycero-3phosphoethanolamine-N-[methoxy(polyethylene glycol)-2000] (ammonium salt) (DSPE-mPEG 2000,
Laysan Lipids, Arab, AL) with 6:1:2:1 ratio in propylene glycol (PG, Sigma Aldrich, Milwaukee, WI) by
heating and sonicating at 80 °C until all the lipids were dissolved. Mixture of glycerol (Gly, Acros Organics)
and phosphate buffer solution (0.8 mL, Gibco, pH 7.4) preheated to 80 °C was added to the lipid solution.
The resulting solution was sonicated for 10 min at room temperature. Note that we typically prepared
batches of 5 or 10 samples at a time and the amounts were adjusted as appropriate. For bubble formation,
the solution (1 mL) was transferred to a 3 mL headspace vial, capped with a rubber septum and aluminum
seal, and sealed with a vial crimper. Air was manually removed with a 30 mL syringe and was replaced by
injecting octafluoropropane (C3F8, Electronic Fluorocarbons, LLC, PA) gas. After air was replaced by
C3F8, the phospholipid solution was activated by mechanical shaking with a VialMix shaker (BristolMyers Squibb Medical Imaging Inc., N. Billerica, MA) for 45s. Nanobubbles were isolated from the
mixture of foam and microbubbles by centrifugation at 50 rcf for 5 mins with the headspace vial inverted,
and the 100 μL NB solution withdrawn from a fixed distance of 5 mm from the bottom with a 21G needle24.
PSMA-NB were prepared by adding DSPE-PEG-PSMA-1 (25µg/ml) to the initial lipid solution and
followed the above protocol. To prepare DSPE-PEG-PSMA-1, PSMA-1 (from prof. James Basilion lab)
was
mixed
with
DSPE-PEG-MAL
(1,2distearoyl-snglycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N[methoxy(polyethylene glycol)-2000- Maleimide, Laysan Bio, Arab, AL) in 1:2 ratio at pH 8.0 in PBS.
After combined, the mixture was vortexed thoroughly and was reacted for 4 hours on the vial rotator at 4
o
C. The product was lyophilized and the resultant powder was dissolved in PBS to obtain DSPE-PEGPSMA-1 stock solution.
Size, concentration, and surface charge of NBs and non-buoyant particles. The size distribution and
concentration of NBs were characterized with resonant mass measurement (Archimedes®, Malvern
Panalytical) equipped with a nanosensor capable of measuring particle size between 50 nm and 2000 nm.
The nanosensor was pre-calibrated with 565 nm polystyrene beads (Thermo ScientificTM Nanospehere
Size Standards 3560A). The NB solution was diluted with PBS (500x) to obtain an acceptable limit of
detection (< 0.01 Hz) and coincidence (< 5%). Prior to any measurement, a 5-min PBS blank was run to
ensure that the system fluidics and sensor were free of particles. Also, between measurements the sensor
and microfluidic tubing were rinsed for 30 seconds with PBS followed by 2 “sneezes” for at least 3 cycles.
During the sample measurement, NB solution was loaded for 120 seconds and analyzed at 2 and 5 psi,
respectively. Samples measurement was finalized after 1000 particles were measured. Data was exported
from the Archimedes software (version 1.2) and analyzed for positive and negative counts24. Dilution was
accounted for in calculating the NB concentration. Surface charge of the diluted NB solution (500X) was
measure with an Anton Paar LitesizerTM 500.

Cell Culture. Retrovirally transformed PSMA positive PC3pip cells and transfection control PC3flu cells
were originally obtained from Dr. Michel Sadelain in the year 2000 (Laboratory of Gene Transfer and Gene
Expression, Gene Transfer and Somatic Cell Engineering Facility, Memorial-Sloan Kettering Cancer
Center, New York, NY). The two cell lines were last checked and authenticated by western blot in
2017. Cells were grown at 37oC and 5% CO2 under a humidified atmosphere. Cells were maintained in
RPMI 1640 medium supplemented (Invitrogen Life Technology, Grand Island, NY) with 2 mM Lglutamine and 10% Fetal Bovine Serum.
Celluar Uptake Studies. PC3pip and PC3flu cells were plated on coverslips at about 70% confluency.
Rhodamine labeled NBs were prepared by mixing DSPE-Rhodamine (50µl) into the lipid cocktail solution
that used to make NB. Twenty-four hours later, cells were incubated with Rhodamine B-labeled
nanobubbles for 1 hour. After incubation, cells were washed three times with PBS, fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde, counterstained with 2-(4-amidinophenyl)-6-indolecarbamidine dihydrochloride
(DAPI), mounted with Fluor-Mount aqueous mounting solution, and observed under Leica DM4000B
fluorescence microscopy (Leica Microsystem Inc, Buffalo Grove, IL). The fluorescent intensity was then
quantified by Image J.
Animal models. Animals were handled according to a protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee (IACUC) at Case Western Reserve University and were in accordance with all
applicable protocols and guidelines in regards to animal use. Four to six week old male athymic nude mice
were anesthetized with inhalation of 3% isoflurane with 1L/min oxygen and were implanted subcutaneously
with 1×106 of PSMA-negative PC3flu and PSMA-positive PC3pip cells in 100 µL matrigel. Animals were
observed every other day until tumors reached at about 8-10 mm in diameter.
Pharmacokinetic study. Two weeks after inoculation, the tumor diameter reached 1 cm animals were used
in the study (n=7). The US probe (PLT-1204BT, AplioXG SSA-790A, Toshiba Medical Imaging Systems,
Otawara-Shi, Japan) was placed to visualize the ultrasound images of the PC3pip and PC3flu dual tumors
and the kidney in the same field of view. Two hundred µl of either undiluted Plain NB or PSMA-NB NB
were administrated via tail vein. After injection of NB, the change of tissue contrast was measured using
contrast harmonic imaging (CHI, frequency 12.0MHz; MI, 0.1; dynamic range, 65dB; gain, 70dB; imaging
frame rate, 0.2 frames/s). The images were acquired in raw data format as a function of time. Fifteen seconds
after raw data acquisition started, nanobubble solution was administrated and continuous image acquisition
continued for 30 min. The remaining NBs were burst by repeated flash replenish (high energy pulses).
Thirty minutes later (1h after first injection, the contrast was reached to baseline level) the same mouse
received PSMA-NB or plain-NB respectively (n=7). Lumason® (sulfur hexafluoride lipid-type A
microspheres, Bracco Diagnostics Inc.) were tested in vivo (n=3). Lumason® was prepared according to
the protocol provided by the manufacturer. The raw data were processed with software provided by the
scanner manufacturer. The kidney, and tumor areas were delineated by drawing regions of interest (ROIs)
and the signal intensity in each ROI as a function of time (time-intensity curve - TIC) was calculated. The
data were exported to Excel, the baseline was subtracted from TIC, and the calculated peak value of TIC
was used to normalize the data to obtain the decay of signal.
Histological Analysis. Animals were divided into 3 groups: Cy5.5-PSMA- NB (n =3), Cy5.5-NB (n = 3),
and no contrast control. Cy 5.5 labeled NBs were prepared by mixing DSPE-PEG-Cy 5.5 (100µl) into the
lipid cocktail solution that used to make NB. Mice received either 200 µl of undiluted contrast material or
PBS alone via tail vein. Twenty five minutes after contrast agent injection, animals were scan using US to
detect the US signal and then PBS perfusion was performed with 50ml PBS though left ventricle. After
perfusion tumors were scan again to perceive the US signal that generate from intact NB. Both PSMA (+)
and PSMA (-) tumors and the kidney were harvested, fixed in paraformaldehyde and embedded in optimal
cutting temperature compound (OCT Sakura Finetek USA Inc., Torrance, CA). The tissues were cut into
8 um slices. Then the CD31 staining was performed to visualize the tumor vessels. Briefly, tissues were
wash 3 times with PBS and incubate with protein blocking solution that contain 0.5% Triton X-100 (Fisher

Scientific, Hampton, NH). Then tissues were incubated in 1:250 diluted primary antibody (CD31 (PECAM1) Monoclonal Antibody (390) Fisher Scientific, Hampton, NH) for 24 hrs at 4o C. After washed with PBS,
one-hour incubation of Alexa 568 tagged secondary antibody (Fisher Scientific, Hampton, NH) performed
and stained with DAPI (Vecor Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) using standard techniques. The fluorescence
images were obtained and analyzed using Axio Vision V 4.8.1.0, Carl Zeiss software (Thornwood, NY).
For PSMA immunohistochemistry, tissues were wash 3 times with PBS and incubate with protein blocking
solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Then tissues were incubated in 1:150 diluted PSMA
primary antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) for 24 hrs at 4 o C and followed the above steps
as for CD31 staining.
Statistical Analysis. Graphs and statistical analyses were generated using Microsoft Excel and Origin lab.
Unpaired Student’s t-test (two-tailed) was used to compare two groups. Data are presented as a mean ±
STD (standard deviation). The experiments were repeated at least three times for each experiment, unless
stated otherwise.
