Aerobic Fitness and Cerebrovascular Function

Abstract
The cross-sectional study investigated the effects of aerobic fitness on cerebrovascular function
in the healthy brain. We quantified grey matter (GM) cerebral blood flow (CBF) and
cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR), in a sample of young adults within a normal fitness range.
Based on existing TCD and fMRI evidence, we predicted a positive relationship between fitness
and resting GM CBF, and CVR. Exploratory hypotheses that higher 𝑉̇O2peak would be associated
with higher GM volume and cognitive performance were also investigated.
20 adults underwent a 𝑉̇O2peak test and a battery of cognitive tests. All subjects underwent an
MRI scan where multiple inversion time (MTI) pulsed arterial spin labelling (PASL) was used to
quantify resting CBF and CVR to 5% CO2.
ROI analysis showed a non-significant negative correlation between whole-brain GM CBF and
𝑉̇O2peak; r=-0.4, p=0.08, corrected p (p’) =0.16 and a significant positive correlation between
𝑉̇O2peak and voxelwise whole-brain GM CVR; r=0.62, p=0.003, p’ =0.006. Voxelwise analysis
revealed a significant inverse association between 𝑉̇O2peak and resting CBF in the left and right
thalamus, brainstem, right lateral occipital cortex, left intracalcarine cortex and cerebellum.
The results of this study suggest that aerobic fitness is associated with lower CBF and greater
CVR in young adults.

Aerobic Fitness and Cerebrovascular Function

Introduction
Neurodegenerative diseases are a global health burden and despite extensive research there are
no cures or effective long-term management solutions. Aerobic fitness has emerged as a
modifiable lifestyle factor which reduces the risk of all-cause mortality (Kodama et al., 2009; Lee,
Artero, Sui, & Blair, 2010), cardiovascular events (Haskell, Lee, Pate, Powell, & Blair, 2007; Lee
et al., 2010; Roque, Hernanz, Salaices, & Briones, 2013) and protects the brain against age and
disease-related decline (Hayes, Alosco, & Forman, 2014; Hillman, Erickson, & Kramer, n.d.;
Nishijima, Torres-Aleman, & Soya, 2016). In addition, brain structure and function are closely
linked; to maintain healthy brain tissue, adequate energy must be supplied. Many studies have
investigated the link between aerobic fitness and brain structure (Voss et al., 2015) but the
relationship between aerobic fitness and cerebrovascular function has not been extensively
studied in humans. The present study focuses on how aerobic fitness impacts the cerebrovascular
processes which maintain delivery of brain nutrients.

Neuroimaging studies have provided evidence of a neuroprotective effect of aerobic fitness in
older adults, linking higher aerobic fitness with greater brain volume (Erickson et al., 2011) and
cerebral blood flow (CBF) (Thomas et al., 2013). Aerobic fitness has also been associated with
greater cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR), which reflects the ability of the cerebral vessels to dilate,
or the vascular reserve, assessed using transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound (Bailey et al.,
2013) in both older and young adults. However, Barnes et al. (2013), using the same technique,
did not find a relationship between CVR and 𝑉̇O2max in younger adults despite observing the same
trend as Bailey et al. (2013) in older adults. Further, the findings of Bailey et al. (2013) and Barnes
et al. (2013) in older adults, do not agree with the MRI results of Thomas et al. (2013) who reported
a lower BOLD-based CVR in masters athletes vs. sedentary young and age-matched controls.

Aerobic Fitness and Cerebrovascular Function

Finally, Gauthier et al. (2015) found that in older adults, BOLD CVR was negatively correlated
with 𝑉̇O2max in frontal regions but positively correlated in periventricular white matter and
portions of the somatosensory cortex. These conflicting CVR data represent an issue of
inconsistent findings regarding aerobic fitness and its effects on cerebrovascular function across
the lifespan.

Recent findings from Hwang et al. (2018) using TCD, also suggest that young adults with higher
levels of aerobic fitness have a greater cerebrovascular response to hypercapnia in the middle
cerebral artery (MCA), during exercise, but found no differences at rest. The higher fit group also
scored better on tests of fluid reasoning, but not on any other tasks included in the cognitive
battery. However, as we are interested in how aerobic fitness may lead to general improvements
in cerebrovascular health rather than vascular regulation during exercise, the current crosssectional study focused on the relationship between aerobic fitness and cerebrovascular function
in the resting brain of young, healthy adults. As the TCD literature suggests a positive relationship
between fitness and CVR in young people, it is important to establish whether functional MRI
reports the same effects, as TCD reflects the arteries rather than grey matter.

The objective of this study was to quantify variations in CBF and CVR, two widely used indices of
cerebrovascular function, in a sample of young, healthy adults within a normal range of fitness
levels (i.e. sedentary and active, but not athletes in structured training). Based on the extant TCD
and fMRI evidence, we predicted a positive relationship between fitness and resting grey matter
CBF. We also expected to see a positive correlation between CVR to CO 2 and 𝑉̇O2peak, a
measure of aerobic fitness, in line with previous findings (Bailey et al., 2013; Hwang, Castelli, &
Gonzalez-Lima, 2017). Tests chosen to measure a number of cognitive domains were included

to examine the exploratory hypotheses that higher 𝑉̇O2peak would be associated with better
cognitive performance and higher grey matter volume. If CBF and CVR differences due to fitness
were evident, then demonstrating additional cognitive benefits would provide evidence for
functionally relevant effects of neurobiological differences. As the issue of inconsistent findings
regarding CVR and 𝑉̇O2peak is potentially due to the different imaging methodologies employed,
this study did not aim to resolve the issue completely. However, in using pulsed arterial spin
labelling (PASL) MRI at multiple imaging delay times, we quantified global grey matter CBF and
CVR in young adults. ASL provides quantitative assessment of global grey matter CBF unaffected
by neuronal function, unlike BOLD fMRI and TCD respectively. Although ASL has SNR limitations,
it is arguably the best technique to investigate CBF and CVR differences associated with
𝑉̇O2peak. The high labelling efficiency and lower sensitivity to off-resonance effects of PASL
(Haller et al., 2016) make it well suited to acquisitions using CO2, as off-resonance effects can
result in underestimation of perfusion where transit and arrival times differ between arteries.

Methods

Participants
20 healthy adults (11 females, mean age 25±4.6) were recruited from advertisements placed
around Cardiff University. The study was approved by the Cardiff University School of Psychology
Research Ethics Committee and performed in accordance with the guidelines stated in the Cardiff
University Research Framework (version 4.0, 2010). All participants were non-smokers and
educated to university level. Informed written consent was obtained from all subjects.

Study Procedures
The study consisted of 3 lab visits. In Visit 1, eligibility screening for MRI, respiratory modulations
(see figure s1) and intensive exercise was carried out. Contraindications to exercise were
assessed using the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PARQ). Sociodemographic
information was recorded and estimations of weekly activity level were established using the
International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) Short Form (Craig et al., 2003). Elevated CO2
inhalation can cause sensations of breathlessness, light headedness and anxiety in some
individuals. For this reason, all volunteers took part in a gas modulation session in a MR scanner
simulator. A stepwise protocol was employed to allow participants time to become accustomed to
CO2 inhalation (see supplementary figure 1).
In Visit 2, volunteers completed 7 cognitive tests, administered by the same researcher for all
participants, prior to the fitness test. The tests, covering a range of cognitive domains, were
chosen as they are validated for use in patient and control samples (see table 1).

Fitness Test
The fitness test was also performed in Visit 2. The PAR-Q was conducted a second time to identify
potential risk factors associated with exercise in the unlikely case of circumstance changes from
Visit 1. The 𝑉̇O2peak test protocol used has previously been described by (Collett et al., 2011;
Cooney et al., 2013). The test began with a 2-minute unloaded warm up at 50 revolutions per
minute (rpm) on a Lode cycle ergometer (Lode, Groningen, Netherlands). During the test,
participants maintained a constant 50rpm and work rate was increased from 50 watts by 25 watts
every 2 minutes. The test was terminated if any of the following criteria were reached; work rate
fell below 45rpm for > 10 seconds, volitional exhaustion occurred, or maximal predicted heart rate
exceeded 100%. At the end of each 2-minute step Borg ratings of perceived exertion, on the
CR10 scale (Borg & Kaijser, 2006) were used to record perceived heaviness of legs and
breathing.

Blood lactate concentration was sampled from the earlobe using Unistik 3 1.8mm lancets
(Williams Medical, Caerphilly, Wales) and tested using the Lactate Plus system (Nova Biomedical,
Waltam, MA USA) at baseline, 2-minute intervals and at exhaustion. Blood pressure (BP) was
recorded at baseline, HR at baseline and 2-minute intervals during the test. Respiratory gas

exchanges were continuously monitored using breath by breath analysis with the Cortex
Metalyser 3b (Cortex Biophysik Metalyzer, Germany). 𝑉̇O2peak was taken as the highest value
over a 30 second block average at the maximum recorded work rate. Heart rate (HR) and work
rate were also recorded at baseline and at 2-minute intervals and electrocardiography (ECG) was
monitored for the duration of the test. Following termination of the 𝑉̇O2peak test participants were
monitored for 10-minutes. In this 10-minute recovery period blood pressure, HR and blood lactate
were sampled every 2 minutes before subjects left the lab.

MRI Acquisition
In Visit 3, volunteers underwent the MR scan. Images were acquired on a 3T whole body MRI
system (GE Excite HDx, Milwaukee, WI, USA) using an eight-channel receive-only head coil.
Heart rate was recorded using a pulse oximeter and a respiratory bellows monitored breathing. A
sampling line connected to the face mask of the breathing circuit(Felipe B Tancredi, Lajoie, &
Hoge, 2014) was used to monitor the partial pressure of end-tidal CO2 (PETCO2) and O2 (PETO2)
via the Biopac® system (Biopac, Worcestershire, UK). The MEDRAD system (MEDRAD,
Pittsburgh, PA) was used to monitor O2 saturation throughout the experiment.

PASL data were acquired using a single subtraction PICORE QUIPSS II (Wong et al., 1998) with
a dual-echo gradient-echo readout (Liu et al., 2002) and spiral k-space acquisition (Glover, 1999)
the first echo being used for CBF quantification. Data were acquired at 8 inversion times; 400,
500, 600, 700, 1100, 1400, 1700 and 2000ms. QUIPSS II cut-off at 700ms meant that short and
long inversion times were acquired in separate runs. 16 and 8 tag-control pairs were acquired for
each of the short and long inversion time respectively. A variable TR was used for efficiency,
1200-1500ms for short TI data (400-700ms) and 1700-2600ms for long TIs (1100-2000ms). Other

acquisition parameters were; TE = 2.7ms, voxel size = 3.5x3.5x7mm 3, 3.2mm in-plane resolution,
matrix size 64x64mm, FOV = 19.8cm, flip angle = 90°, slice delay 55ms, 15 slices, slice gap
1.5mm for maximum brain coverage. Label thickness was 200mm with 10mm gap between the
end of the label and the most proximal imaging slice.

A calibration image without any labelling was acquired before the perfusion mages using the same
acquisition parameters, except a long TR; this was used to obtain the equilibrium magnetisation
of cerebrospinal fluid (M0, CSF), needed for the quantification of CBF. A minimal contrast image
was also acquired to correct for coil inhomogeneities with TE = 11ms, TR = 2s. The PASL
acquisition was performed twice, first during rest, then while volunteers were hypercapnic. The
hypercapnic modulation was carried out using the prospective control method described by
(Tancredi & Hoge, 2013). A gas mixing chamber constructed in-house had three feeding lines
coming in for the delivery of medical air, 5% CO2, and medical oxygen, the latter incorporated as
a safety backup but not used during experimentation, the circuit is described in detail by (Tancredi,
Lajoie, & Hoge, 2014). PETCO2 elevation of 7mmHg was targeted using 5% CO2 (balance air) and
the scan commenced once participants reached the target CO2 level. ASL data acquisition lasted
~6 minutes during rest, followed by a delay to allow the onset of hypercapnia. Once a PETCO2
elevation of approximately 7mmHg was achieved, the ~6 minute ASL acquisition was repeated.

A T1-weighted 3D structural fast spoiled gradient echo (FSPGR) scan was also acquired for
registration of functional data and voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis; TR/TE = 7.8/2.9ms,
resolution = 1mm isotropic.

Data Analysis
𝑽̇O2peak Calculation
𝑉̇O2peak was calculated from the respiratory gas exchanges which were continuously monitored
using breath-by-breath analysis and averaged over 10 second blocks. 𝑉̇O2peak was defined as
the 30-second averaged value at maximum recorded work rate. HR, respiratory exchange ratio
(RER) and blood lactate were recorded every 2 minutes and at termination of the fitness test to
validate 𝑉̇O2peak criteria being reached. The test result was considered valid if heart rate
exceeded 90% of age predicted maximum, RER >1 and blood lactate concentration was greater
than 8 mM at the end of the test (Horton et al., 2011; Milani, Lavie, Mehra, & Ventura, 2006;
Poole, Wilkerson, & Jones, 2008).
Cognitive Data Scoring
Cognitive data were scored by hand by the same researcher, the Conners Continuous
Performance test is computer based and scored automatically. Demeaned scores were
calculated for correlation analysis with 𝑉̇O2peak and MR data.
Image Analysis
Physiological noise correction was carried out using a modified RETROICOR (Glover, Li, & Ress,
2000) to remove cardiac and respiratory noise components from the data. ASL data were motion
corrected using MCFLIRT within FSL (FMRIB’s Software Library, www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl,
(Jenkinson, Bannister, Brady, & Smith, 2002). The CBF timeseries for the normocapnia and
hypercapnia scans were corrected for coil sensitivity inhomogeneities using the minimal contrast
images (Wang, Qiu, & Constable, 2005). Average difference images were obtained for each
inversion time from tag-control subtraction of the CBF time series (Lu, Donahue, & Van Zijl, 2006)

and a perfusion map was created from all inversion times using a two-compartment CBF kinetic
model implemented using the BASIL toolkit of FSL (Chappell et al., 2010) . Within this framework,
perfusion maps were converted to ml/100g/min using the CSF signal as a reference to estimate
the fully relaxed magnetisation of water in blood (Chalela et al., 2000). The mean resting CBF for
each subject was calculated by averaging the CBF time series over all time points and over all
voxels within the masked grey matter image (see below). CVR was calculated by dividing the
percentage change in CBF from rest during hypercapnia by the mmHg change in PETCO2 increase
during hypercapnia.
Grey Matter Volume
T1-weighted structural data were analysed with FSL-VBM (Douaud et al., 2007; Good et al., 2001)
http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FSLVBM). Structural images were brain extracted and
segmented into grey matter, white matter and CSF before being registered to the MNI 152
standard space template using non-linear registration (Andersson et al., 2007). The resulting
images were averaged and flipped along the x-axis to create a left-right symmetric, group-specific
GM template. Second, all native GM images were non-linearly registered to this study-specific
template and modulated to correct for local expansion (or contraction) due to the non-linear
component of the spatial transformation. The modulated GM images were then smoothed with an
isotropic Gaussian kernel with a sigma of 3mm. Finally, voxelwise GLM was applied using
permutation-based non-parametric testing, correcting for multiple comparisons across space to
investigate whether GM volume and 𝑉̇O2peak were correlated.

ROI Analysis of Whole Grey Matter CBF and CVR
Individual subject grey matter masks were created using FMRIB's Automated Segmentation Tool
(FAST) and thresholded to include voxels with >50% grey matter probability. ROI analysis of the
relationship between grey matter CBF at rest, CVR and 𝑉̇O2peak was carried out using correlation
analysis and permutation testing (100,000 permutations per comparison) in Matlab (Mathworks
Inc., MA, USA). Permutation testing was used as an alternative to Bonferroni correction for
multiple comparisons which is too conservative when potentially related variables are tested. This
approach was also applied to examine the associations between grey matter CBF and CVR, and
cognitive test scores.

comparisons across voxels. Significance was set at p < 0.05 (FDR corrected).

All subjects completed the fitness test. Out of the 20 subjects 17 achieved an RER > 1.1 and 3
achieved RER > 1. 17 subjects exceeded the 90% HR maximum threshold and achieved a lactate
peak >9, the remaining 3 exceeded 80% of HR maximum and achieved a lactate peak >6. As this
was a 𝑉̇O2peak test all subjects satisfied test criteria by working to volitional exhaustion. Based
on typical 𝑉̇O2max criteria, 17 subjects fulfilled criteria for a maximal exercise test (Dupuy et al.,

inhalation during the MRI scans were reported in this sample.

Correlations between CBF, CVR and 𝑽̇O2peak
ROI Analysis
There was a non-significant inverse association between 𝑉̇O2peak and resting CBF in grey
matter; r = -0.4, p = 0.08 p’ =.16 (figure 1) and a significant positive correlation between 𝑉̇O2peak
and CVR; r = 0.62, p = 0.003, p’ =0.006 (figure 2).
Follow-up exploratory analysis showed that baseline PETCO2 was not associated with 𝑉̇O2peak;
r = -0.05, p = 0.8 (supplementary figure 2), nor was the PETCO2 change during hypercapnia
associated with 𝑉̇O2peak; r= 0.26.p = 0.27.

Aerobic Fitness and Cerebrovascular Function

Discussion

Summary
In this study, we examined the association between aerobic fitness and CBF and CVR using
multiple inversion time PASL. This is the first study to report associations between aerobic fitness,
CBF-based CVR as opposed to BOLD-based CVR, and whole grey matter CBF in young adults
using ASL. Across the group, higher 𝑉̇O2peak was associated with lower regional resting CBF
and greater global grey matter CVR to CO2. 𝑉̇O2peak was not associated with cognitive task
performance or grey matter volume in this cohort.

𝑽̇O2peak, CBF and CVR
The inverse correlation between CBF and 𝑉̇O2peak was not expected, as the opposite has been
found in children (Chaddock-Heyman et al., 2016), young adults (Bailey et al., 2013) and older
adults (Ainslie et al., 2008; Bailey et al., 2013; Brown et al., 2010; Thomas et al., 2013;
Zimmerman et al., 2014). However, with the exception of Thomas et al., (2013), Zimmerman et
al., (2014) and (Chaddock-Heyman et al., 2016), previous studies have used TCD ultrasound.
TCD measures blood flow velocity, not flow, as TCD does not measure vessel diameter which
would be required to calculate flow using this method. In contrast, ASL measures CBF directly
through the labelling of inflowing water to tissue. Therefore, results may differ as they are
measuring different, albeit related, vascular parameters. Recent efforts to characterise
differences between MRI and TCD measures of CVR are valuable and will allow the methods to
be used as complementary techniques given that TCD can be conducted under conditions not
suited to MRI. For example, Burley et al. (2017) reported a positive correlation between VO2max
and CVR using both BOLD fMRI and TCD suggesting that the methods are not necessarily

contradictory (Bailey et al., 2013; Thomas et al., 2013) and could be used to investigate brain
function within groups at rest and during exercise. The main limitations of TCD are that it lacks
the spatial resolution and range of neurophysiological measures that can be recorded with
quantitative MRI.
Most existing MRI studies investigated groups undergoing neurodevelopment (ChaddockHeyman et al., 2016) and older adults (Thomas, Liu, Park, van Osch, & Lu, 2014; Zimmerman et
al., 2014) where the mechanistic relationships with aerobic fitness may be different to adults not
in stages of either development or decline which may explain why results are not consistent
across studies with different age groups

In this study, CBF showed a non-significant inverse correlation with 𝑉̇O2peak across the whole of
grey matter. Statistical significance was localised to regions of the thalamus, brainstem, visual
cortex, cerebellum and precuneus. Regional variation in contrast-to-noise may explain why these
specific regions correlated with fitness in this sample, however, previous studies have also
reported regional rather than global effects.
A study by Robertson et al. (2015) in stroke survivors, using single inversion time PCASL, similarly
found an inverse correlation between precuneus CBF and aerobic fitness, but a positive
correlation between thalamic and posterior cingulate CBF and aerobic fitness. Gauthier et al.
(2015) found both positive and inverse correlations between CVR and aerobic fitness in older
adults, and this, along with the Robertson et al. (2015) study adds to the evidence that aerobic
fitness may have complex, regionally varying and age dependent effects on the brain. Although
the direction of the correlation in stroke survivors in the thalamus and posterior cingulate cortex
contradicts the current results, the current study and those of Robertson et al. (2015) and Gauthier
et al. (2015) further suggest that aerobic fitness may exert localised effects on CBF (Chaddock-

Aerobic Fitness and Cerebrovascular Function

Heyman et al., 2016; Thomas et al., 2013). Given that participants in each of these cited studies
have differed in age and health status, the fact that consistent findings have not been reported is
unsurprising. The variance in the effects of aerobic fitness on brain function with age needs further
investigation through interventions in young and older groups as there may be a cross-over effect
whereby higher CBF in youth and older adulthood has different functional importance. The
duration of a given fitness level may also be important in interpreting results; for example, those
who have maintained a high fitness level throughout their life may have a different
cerebrovascular profile from those who more recently achieved a similarly high 𝑉̇O2 score. The
current study consists of a normal sample of young adults who varied in fitness level, but not to
the extent that a cross-sectional sample comprised of athletes and sedentary individuals would.
However, our sample had a mean 𝑉̇O2peak of 41 ml/kg/min, standard deviation 8, similar to
Hwang et al., (2017) who reported an average 𝑉̇O2max of 37.8, standard deviation 9.6 in a sample
of 87 participants and also found a positive correlation between aerobic fitness and CVR in the
MCA. The range of fitness levels within the study sample is likely to dictate the degree of observed
fitness-related brain effects, especially in healthy groups. In fact, as well as differences in study
design, the spread of fitness levels within studies may also explain the differences in the results
of Barnes et al. (2013) and Bailey et al. (2013). Bailey et al. (2013) compared CVR between two
groups, sedentary vs. trained, whereas Barnes et al. (2013) used a single group with a range of
fitness levels who did not participate in a structured training regime.

There is a neurobiological interpretation which potentially explains the negative correlation
between CBF and 𝑉̇O2peak in this study. Regular exercise training which increases 𝑉̇O2max, can
result in increased tissue capacity to extract oxygen from blood in muscle (Kalliokoski et al., 2001;
Ookawara et al., 2002), potentially as a result of greater blood vessel density which facilitates

oxygen diffusion throughout the tissue. A higher cerebral oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) in more
aerobically fit subjects could explain the negative correlation observed, as less CBF would be
required to maintain the cerebral rate of oxygen metabolism. In diseases where hypoperfusion is
present, OEF is higher, due to the inverse correlation between CBF and OEF (Germuska et al.,
2019), and cerebral autoregulation works to maintain oxygen supply to the brain when CBF is
suboptimal.(Derdeyn et al., 2002; Román, Erkinjuntti, Wallin, Pantoni, & Chui, 2002). However,
in the healthy brain, assuming SaO2 is close to 1, greater fitness-related OEF may be an indirect
result of higher oxygen availability in the brain allowing it to extract the required energy more
efficiently and thus a lower rate of CBF is sufficient. In later adulthood, this efficiency may serve
to sustain cerebrovascular function meaning that optimal blood flow is maintained in trained
subjects, as the typical age-related CBF decrease is offset. This could explain the seemingly
opposing effects of higher aerobic fitness on CBF seen in this study in young adults and existing
work in older adults (Chapman et al., 2013; Thomas et al., 2013). Further evidence for differential
effects of aerobic fitness with age comes from a recent structural MRI study by Williams et al.
(2017) which reported a positive correlation between cortical thickness and 𝑉̇O2peak in older
adults but an inverse correlation between these measures in young adults. In terms of function
and metabolism, future studies examining the relationship between aerobic fitness, CBF and OEF
would clarify whether the evidence supports this explanation. CBF quantification in older adults
must also be interpreted with caution where partial volume effects have not been controlled for.
Cortical atrophy and delayed bolus arrival times due to ageing combined with ASL voxel sizes of
~7mm mean that perfusion may be underestimated where partial volume correction is not carried
out.

Aerobic Fitness and Cerebrovascular Function

Data from experimental models supports the current results. Young animals subjected to wheel
running for several weeks had increased angiogenesis, and therefore capillary density, compared
with sedentary animals (Pereira et al., 2007; Swain et al., 2003). A similar process may occur in
humans where capillary density is higher in those with greater aerobic fitness as a result of longterm exercise participation, and in turn, such individuals may have greater oxygenated blood
availability without necessarily increasing CBF. Lower capillary density would restrict the diffusion
of oxygen into tissue as the oxygen gradient would be lower (Leithner & Royl, 2013), therefore,
higher CBF rates under certain conditions may reflect vascular inefficiency where greater flow
rates are necessary for optimal brain oxygenation. However, the short duration of interventions
and lifespan of rodents means that the increased capillary density seen in these studies may not
be comparable to work investigating effects of long term aerobic fitness, gained through years of
physical training in humans.

Upon neuronal activation, there is an increase in demand for energy; in the healthy brain this is
met with an increase in CBF. The lower resting CBF observed in higher fit individuals, although
initially counterintuitive, is not problematic if there is an adequate vascular reserve to meet
changes in energy demand. The data support this argument as a greater grey matter CVR to CO2
was observed in subjects with a higher 𝑉̇O2peak. If aerobic fitness maintains CBF and
oxygenation, both of which are affected by ageing (Aanerud et al., 2012), then an increase in
CBF, and potentially CVR, in the trained group, would be expected when comparing trained
versus sedentary older adults. However, if aerobic fitness also enhances oxygen extraction
efficiency, in young people this so-called efficiency may be observed as a reduced resting CBF if
aerobic fitness does indeed increase the number of blood vessels and therefore CBV as outlined
above. Greater vessel density would increase the capacity for oxygenation and oxygen diffusion

gradient across the tissue. In addition, CVR and 𝑉̇O2peak may then be positively correlated due
to a higher vascular reserve, leading to a greater CBF response to CO2 as CBF increases well
above what is required to respond to a stimulus (Raichle, 1986). Future work which quantifies
OEF, CBF and CVR in similar populations could provide the additional necessary information to
understand cerebral vascular and metabolic function at different levels of aerobic fitness.

The ROI analysis showed a positive correlation between CVR and 𝑉̇O2peak in global grey matter,
however no specific regions emerged in a follow-up voxelwise analysis. CVR declines with age
(De Vis et al., 2015; Peng et al., 2018) but in the literature, there are contradictory reports on the
association between CVR and aerobic fitness (Bailey et al., 2013; Barnes, Taylor, Kluck, Johnson,
& Joyner, 2013; Gauthier et al., 2015; Thomas et al., 2013), as discussed in the introduction. The
positive association between 𝑉̇O2peak and CVR reported here is in line with the TCD findings by
Bailey et al. (2013), whereby trained young adults had greater CVR than a sedentary comparison
group. However, few studies have investigated the relationship between CVR and aerobic fitness
in healthy young adults, therefore more work is needed to adequately understand this relationship.
Overall results across studies using MRI and TCD to study CBF, flow velocity and CVR suggest
that exercise training and aerobic fitness has complex and varying effects on brain regions with
potential mechanistic differences across the lifespan. This complexity presents an important area
of future research in different age groups, and a need to comprehensively map cerebrovascular
function across the brain.

Finally, it should be noted that De Vis et al. (2015) showed that resting PETCO2 accounted for
age-related CBF differences almost entirely. In this study, there was a non-significant positive
trend (r = 0.4, p = 0.06) between baseline PETCO2 and CBF, but no strong associations between

𝑉̇O2peak and baseline PETCO2 (r=0.05, p=0.8) or the PETCO2 during hypercapnia (r=0.26, p =
0.27, see supplementary figures s2-s4). This suggests a cerebrovascular effect of fitness on CVR
rather than an effect driven by PETCO2 differences.

Cognitive Performance and Grey Matter Volume
Cognitive performance scores were similar across the group and there were no strong
associations with 𝑉̇O2peak nor with CBF or CVR (see supplementary tables 1 and 2). It is possible
that cognitive differences in young adults may only be visible at more extreme ends of the fitness
spectrum than sampled in this study. It is also possible that more sensitive cognitive tests are
required to detect differences among high functioning groups separated only by fitness level.

The cognitive reserve hypothesis (Chodzko-Zajko & Moore, 1994) states that higher fitness in
older age offsets age-related decline in cerebral circulation, enhancing oxygen delivery to support
neural demand. More recently, (Etnier, Nowell, Landers, & Sibley, 2006) conducted a metaregression on studies examining the effects of fitness on cognitive function. In summary, the
authors did not find strong support for a beneficial effect of fitness in any age group once
moderator variables were considered, and in fact found a negative association between fitness
and cognition in studies using a pre-post design. Only a very small number of studies report a
beneficial effect of fitness or physical activity on select cognitive domains in young people ( Baym
et al., 2011; Themanon, Pontifex & Hillman, 2009; Stroth, Hille, Spitzer, & Reinhardt, 2016 and
other studies report significant effects in older but not young adults (Hayes, Forman, & Verfaellie,
2014). In summary, more work is needed in young adults to determine neurophysiological effects
of aerobic fitness and their functional relevance in terms of health and cognition.

Aerobic Fitness and Cerebrovascular Function

Aerobic fitness is believed to reduce age-related atrophy, mainly in the hippocampus (Erickson
et al., 2011; Firth et al., 2018). In this study the focus was on cerebrovascular function, not brain
structure, however, if structural differences were present, this would affect CBF and CVR. The
VBM analysis showed that grey matter global volume differences due to fitness were not present.
As this group was young and healthy, this finding is not wholly surprising, and suggests that
volumetric differences only become apparent in later life, adding to our knowledge of the lifelong
effects of aerobic fitness.

Limitations
Haemoglobin (Hb) levels were not measured. Hb is a protein molecule found in red blood cells
which is responsible for transport of O2 to tissue. The concentration of Hb in blood affects exercise
performance; reduced Hb means that blood can carry less oxygen (Calbet, 2006) and therefore
muscle function is impaired. In addition, Hb affects perfusion estimates as there is an inverse
relationship between [Hb] and the longitudinal relaxation time (T1) of blood. Brain Hb cannot be
measured directly in-vivo, however capillary samples may provide an indication of Hb differences
between subjects or groups which could help to explain biological mechanisms driving CBF
differences.

Second, investigations were restricted to grey matter. Due to the limited SNR of ASL, reliable
quantification of CBF and CVR in white matter is difficult as CBF is much lower than in grey matter.
However, adequate blood supply and energy metabolism is necessary for all round brain health,
and ageing is associated with damage to white matter microstructure and reductions in

myelination (Gunning-Dixon, Brickman, Cheng, & Alexopoulos, 2009). Therefore, improvement
of methods to study the WM vasculature are also needed to understand the global effects of
fitness.

The voxelwise and ROI analyses did not show the same statistical significances. While the
voxelwise analysis of CBF revealed regions of significantly lower CBF with fitness, the ROI
analysis showed a non-significant trend in the same direction for global grey matter. The ROI
analysis of CVR however, showed a moderate (0.6) significant correlation with fitness while the
voxelwise analysis did not reach statistical significance. ASL is an intrinsically low SNR technique
compared to BOLD fMRI. Although ASL offers significant benefits in terms of quantification of
physiological parameters, the SNR may have prevented detection of greater voxelwise
associations with 𝑉̇O2peak.
Lastly, there are known hormonal effects on exercise test performance (Jonge, 2003) and CBF
(Brackley, Ramsay, Pipkin, & Rubin, 1999; Duckles & Krause, 2007). In the present study, the
resting CBF difference was not significantly different between males and females; t(18)=-0.602,
p = 0.094, but controlling for menstrual cycle phase, which was not done here, could reduce
variability within cohorts. This is a preferable option to limiting studies to males only as hormonal
differences may play a role in the acute response to exercise and possibly in mediating the effects
of fitness on brain health.

Summary and Future Directions
The results of this study suggest that aerobic fitness is associated with lower CBF and greater
CVR in young, healthy adults, however the modest effects observed need replication in larger
samples. We currently know very little about the functional relevance of CBF or CVR differences

in young adults, and how the observed neurophysiological effects of physical training differ from
those observed in older adults. With recent advances in quantitative MRI techniques, noninvasive mapping of multiple indices of cerebrovascular function e.g. CBF, CVR, CBV OEF and
the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption is possible within a single scan session (Bulte
et al., 2012; Gauthier, Desjardins-Crépeau, Madjar, Bherer, & Hoge, 2012; Gauthier & Hoge,
2013; Wise, Harris, Stone, & Murphy, 2013). Notably, regional CBV quantification would bring us
a step closer to comparisons with experimental data on angiogenesis and capillary density
following exercise as CBV and capillary density are presumed to be linked.

Application of these techniques to study brain function in both young and older trained and
sedentary adults will provide information necessary to move forward in developing exercise
training protocols to increase the adoption of fitness training as a preventative health tool. Also,
although complete standardisation of data acquisition and analysis pipelines among researchers
in this area is not realistic or warranted given the variety of questions to be addressed, a degree
of standardisation would be helpful in resolving the differences found in the literature between
MRI studies of CVR (Gauthier et al., 2015; Thomas et al., 2013). Further, making data freely
available, so that researchers can pool data from similar studies using ASL or BOLD to investigate
the cerebral effects of fitness, would build a clearer picture of effects across the age and fitness
level spectrums. Importantly it would also increase statistical power which is sometimes lacking
in MRI studies due to the high cost of the technique.

Research over the next decade should also work to establish whether regular exercise regardless
of intensity level delivers brain benefits, or whether there is an aerobic fitness threshold, above
