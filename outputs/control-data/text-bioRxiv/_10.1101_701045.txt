Abstract

12

Water buffalo holds the tremendous potential of milk and meat that widespread

13

throughout central and southern China. However, characterization of the population

14

genetics of Chinese buffalo is poorly understood. Using Axiom® buffalo genotyping

15

array, we performed the genetic diversity, linkage disequilibrium (LD) pattern and

16

signature of selection in the 176 Chinese buffaloes from thirteen breeds. A total of

17

35,547 SNPs passed quality control and were used for further analyses. Population

18

genetic analysis revealed a clear separation between the swamp and river types. Ten

19

Chinese indigenous breeds clustered into the swamp group, Murrah and Nili-Ravi

20

breeds were the river group, and the crossbred breed was closer to the river group.

21

Genetic diversity analysis showed that the swamp group had a lower average expected

22

heterozygosities compared to the river group. LD decay distance was much shorter in

23

2
the swamp group compared with the river group with 𝑟0.2
value of approximately 50

24

Kb. Analysis of runs of homozygosity indicated that extensive remote and recent

25

inbreeding activity was respectively found within swamp and river groups. Moreover,

26

a total of 12 genomic regions under selection were detected between river and swamp

27

groups. Further, 12 QTL regions were found associated with buffalo milk production

28

traits. Some candidate genes within these QTLs were predicted to be involved in the

cell structure and function, suggesting that these genes might play vital roles in the

30

buffalo milk performance. Our data contribute to our understanding of the

31

characterization of population genetics in Chinese buffaloes, which in turn may be

32

utilized in buffalo breeding programs.

Author Summary

34

Identifying the causal genes or markers associated with important economic traits in

35

livestock is critical to increasing the production level on the species. However, current

36

understanding of the genetic basis for milk production traits in buffalo is limited.

37

Here, we confirmed the divergent evolution, distinct population structure, and LD

38

extent among Chinese buffalo breeds. We also identified 12 QTL regions associated

39

with milk production traits in buffaloes using the selective sweeps and haplotype

40

analysis. Further, a total of 7 genes involved in the cell structure and function were

41

predicted within the identified QTLs. These findings suggested that these genes can

42

serve as the candidate genes associated with buffalo milk production, which hold a

43

vital role in the milk trait improvement of dairy buffalo industry.

Introduction

45

Water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis), primarily raised for milk, meat and draught power,

46

is an essential part of the agricultural economy of many countries around the world.

47

Broadly, buffalo mainly consists of two types: the river (B. bubalis bubalis; n=50) and

48

swamp (B. bubalis carabensis; n=48), which are primarily distinguished based on

49

their distinct morphology and chromosomal karyotypes [1]. In China, the indigenous

50

buffaloes were mainly the swamp type, with the largest number of swamp population

51

across the world. To date, Chinese swamp buffaloes have been classed into 24 local

52

types based mainly on the regional distribution [2]. To improve the milk and meat

53

performance of swamp buffalo, crossbred buffalo by hybridizing the river-type bulls

54

with swamp-type cows has been practiced in many Asian countries, and they are

55

fertile, although the hybrid may have a lower reproductive value [3, 4]. The cross-

56

breeding programs in China began in the 1950s by introducing the exotic river breeds

57

such as Murrah and Nili-Ravi, which has resulted in the different crossbred breeds

58

including the Murrah × local buffalo, Nili-Ravi × indigenous buffalo, and Murrah ×

59

Nili-Ravi × indigenous buffalo. These animals have higher milk production (~1,700

60

kg per lactation) than that of swamp buffalo (~500-800 kg per lactation) after multiple

61

cross breeding for several decades, which is still lower than that of the river buffalo

62

breeds (~2,200 kg/lactation) [5]. Therefore, it is of great interest to genetically dissect

63

the molecular basis of buffalo complex traits such as milk and meat, which contribute

64

to the development of dairy buffalo industry.

65

Knowledge of genetic diversity within and among breeds and populations is

66

crucial for their domestication, conservation, and management. In the past few

67

decades, two independent domestication events of the river and swamp buffaloes were

68

confirmed using the Y-chromosomal [6] and mitochondrial DNA [7] technologies.

69

River buffalo was domesticated in the western region of the Indian subcontinent [8],

70

while swamp buffalo was domesticated in the border between Indochina and

71

Southwestern China occurred 4000 years ago [9, 10]. More importantly, a robust

72

geographic differentiation was found within the swamp buffaloes [9], and the

73

Southwestern buffalo populations in China had the highest genetic diversity compared

74

to the other domestication centers (Central and Southwestern China) [11]. These

75

domestication events, including the natural and artificial selection, help to shape and

76

stabilize the buffalo breed characteristics. For example, river buffalo is well known to

77

be a breed that is mainly used for milk and meat production, while swamp buffalo is

78

essentially a draught animal with lower milk production. With the acceleration of

79

urbanization, however, swamp buffalo population in China shows a rapid decline

80

trend in recent years, especially some endangered swamp breeds emerged. It is well

81

known that a drop in population size may generally cause the decline of genetic

82

diversity by genetic drift and inbreeding [12]. Because of genetic diversity underpins

83

population resilience and persistence, it is of considerable importance to investigate

84

the genetic diversity of swamp buffalo breed in China. These results will play a vital

85

role in the buffalo genetic improvement, particularly in its breeding programs.

86

In the last decade, genome/transcriptome-wide molecular markers were identified

87

using high-throughput sequencing [13-15], which can be utilized for animal breeding

88

and genetic studies. Deng et al. [16] identified 17,401 simple sequence repeats (SSRs)

89

in swamp buffalo that could be used as potential molecular markers by the Illumina

90

paired-end technology that could help spearhead molecular genetics research studies

91

on this species. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is another critical marker that

92

can be used in genetic diversity studies or genetic mapping. Various genotyping

93

techniques have also been developed for SNP discovery, ranging from the low-

94

throughput allele-specific PCR [17] to high-throughput methods of genotyping

95

hundreds of thousands of SNPs in parallel [18]. To date, high-throughput SNP

96

genotyping has been extensively applied to various domestic animals [19-21] and

97

plants [22]. The first SNP genotyping platform (Axiom® buffalo genotyping array;

98

90K Affymetrix) designed explicitly for river buffalo has recently been developed

99

[23] and used for the genome-wide analysis study (GWAS) in different buffalo breeds

100

[24-26]. This SNP90K array provides a viable choice for buffalo scientific research

101

such as molecular breeding, complex traits, conservation, and biodiversity.

102

Several methods have been developed to detect signatures of recent selection in

103

domesticated animals [27]. These methods mainly based on the linkage disequilibrium

104

(LD), spectra of allele frequencies, and characteristics of haplotype structures in the

105

studied populations [28]. Notably, identifying signatures of selection could provide

106

insight into the genomic response to domestication and selection for production traits,

107

which help in the design of more efficient selection schemes [29]. To date, numbers

108

selective sweep regions associated with production traits has been identified in

109

domesticated animals, such as milk production traits [30], reproductive traits [31],

110

feed efficiency [32], elongation of the back [33], and lack of horns [34]. For the Azeri

111

and Khuzestani buffalo breeds, Mokhber et al. [35] identified 13 selective sweep

112

regions that are potentially related to economically important traits using the genome-

113

wide SNP data. However, the selection footprints among the Chinese buffalo breeds

114

remain unexplored. Therefore, we investigated thirteen buffalo breeds in South China

115

region using the buffalo SNP90K array, aiming to explore the genetic diversity, LD

116

extent, signature of selection and quantitative trait locus (QTL) among the studied

117

breeds, which will benefit in the development of an SNP genotyping panel for swamp

118

buffalo and promote the buffalo complex traits research and breeding program.

Results

120

SNP Characteristics

121

Statistic information on 176 buffaloes representing 13 breeds was summarized in

122

Table 1. SNP information regarding the chromosomes, numbers, and length was

123

listed in the S1 Table. A total of 35,547 SNPs was generated after filtering that

124

covered 1309.75 Mb with an average distance of 36.84 Kb between adjacent SNPs.

125

The average chromosomal length ranged from 21.97 Mb on Chr24 to 102.63 Mb on

126

Chr1. The mean length of adjacent SNPs per chromosome ranged between 32.69 to

127

54.63 Kb on Chr19 and ChrX, respectively. The average LD was 0.21 across the

128

buffalo genome.

129

Population analysis

130

Principal components analysis (PCA) showed a distinct separation between the river

131

and swamp types (Fig 1A). The crossbred buffaloes were originated from the swamp-

132

and river-type buffaloes and were concordantly located between them. Similar genetic

133

relationship among analyzed breeds was also supported by phylogenetic analysis (Fig

134

1B) and population structure analysis (Fig 1C). As showed in Fig 1C, K=2

135

represented the most appropriate population number for the present dataset, indicating

136

that there was an apparent differential distribution between river and swamp types.

137

This suggested that the studied buffalo breeds can be divided into two groups (river

138

and swamp) for further analysis.

140

Distribution of 5 minor allele frequency (MAF) classes between river and swamp

141

groups were presented in Fig 2. Compared to the river group, buffalo breeds in

142

swamp group had the highest proportion of SNPs with lower MAF category (0, 0.1].

143

Buffalo breeds in river group had a relatively high proportion of SNPs with high MAF

144

(mostly (0.2, 0.3], (0.3, 0.4], and (0.4, 0.5]).

145

Genome-wide genetic diversity metrics within breeds were measured by the

146

observed heterozygosity (HO), expected heterozygosity (He), and allelic richness (AR)

147

(Table 1). Overall, buffaloes in river group displayed a comparably high level of

148

polymorphism SNPs (50.87%) compared to the swamp group (37.99%). They had

149

higher genetic diversity compared to the swamp group, as measured by the HO (0.429

150

± 0.11 vs. 0.167 ± 0.18) and He (0.436 ± 0.08 vs. 0.174 ± 0.19). The average

151

heterozygosity estimates were highest for Murrah breed in the river group (HO: 0.446

152

± 0.17; He: 0.427 ± 0.11) and lowest for DEC breed in swamp group (HO: 0.250 ±

153

0.19; He: 0.250 ± 0.17). The allelic richness for swamp group (AR = 1.740) was lower

154

than that of the river group (AR = 1.994). Notably, the DEC breed in swamp group

155

was observed to have the lowest AR (AR = 1.556), while the XIL breed revealed the

156

lowest AR (AR = 1.354).

157

Population differentiation estimates showed that the pairwise FST values ranged

158

from 0.0076 to 0.7535 across the studied breeds (S2 Table). For the swamp group,

159

HUN was most closely related to FUZ (FST = 0.0087), GUI (FST = 0.0092), YIB (FST

160

= 0.0100), ENS (FST = 0.0128), FUL (FST = 0.0129), YAN (FST = 0.0148), DEC (FST

161

= 0.0189), XIL (FST = 0.0229), and DEH (FST = 0.0498). For the river group,

162

crossbreds showed a close relationship with the Murrah (FST = 0.0542) and Nili-Ravi

163

(FST = 0.0724) breeds.

164

Linkage disequilibrium and Autozygosity Segments

165

Overall estimated LD between river and swamp groups was different in the present

166

study (Fig 3A). Compared to the river group (r2 =0.61), the highest maximum average

167

LD (r2=0.88) was found within the swamp group. As expected, LD declined as the

168

physical distance between pairwise SNPs. LD decay in swamp group had declined

169

markedly compared with the river group. The average distance when LD decay

170

dropped to the value of 0.2 was approximately 15 Kb for swamp and 50 Kb for river

171

group, respectively.

172

To estimate the recent inbreeding, we performed the genome-wide autozygosity

173

analysis with the runs of homozygosity (ROH) between river and swamp groups. The

174

result showed that buffaloes in swamp group had higher overall levels of FROH than

175

that of river group (Fig 3B). Moreover, we also estimated the ROH distribution by the

176

length between the river and swamp groups (S1 Fig). The results showed that the

177

difference in genetic diversity was found between river and swamp group. Buffaloes

178

in swamp group had the lower fraction of ROH in short tract (0-2 Mb), while the river

179

breed exhibit a higher faction of ROH in long tract (>16 Mb).

180

Signatures of selection

181

The hapFLK statistic that accounted for the haplotype information and hierarchical

182

structure [36, 37] was used to identify selection footprints on the contrast model (river

183

vs. swamp). HapFLK analyses revealed that a total of 12 genomic regions was

184

identifed (Fig 4). These regions were located on chromosomes 1 (197,939,132-

185

201,746,066 Kb), 2 (84,613,461-91,314,070 Kb), 8 (80,317,117-88,124,162 and

186

96,080,274-98,588,633 Kb), 11 (25,584,886-27,617,098 Kb), 12 (15,979,826-

187

16,215,148 Kb), 15 (7,435,513-13,248,436 Kb), 16 (64,367,119-69,995,014,

188

70,024,989-79,994,535, and 80,043,731-83,241,865 Kb), 19 (69,537,494-71,631,407

189

Kb), and 24 (12,608,124-13,746,779 Kb). Table 2 summarizes the annotation

190

information of outlier SNPs within the contrast model. The candidate selective sweep

191

regions ranged from 0.24 Mb to 9.97 Mb on Chr12 and Chr16, respectively.

192

The average length of the candidate regions was 4.24 Mb. The largest number of

193

SNPs (35) within a genomic region was found in Chr15 with a length of 5.81 Mb.

194

Notably, a total of 12 top significantly SNPs was identified, corresponding to the 8

195

candidate genes and one lncRNA (LOC112579725) fragment.

196

Identification of QTLs

197

To further identify the QTLs associated with milk production traits in buffaloes, we

198

firstly performed the haplotypes analysis using a 0.5-Mb window around the top

199

significantly SNPs (Fig 5). The results showed that a total of 18 blocks was identified

200

and located on chromosomes 8, 11, 12, 16, 19, and 24, respectively. For them, a total

201

of 4 blocks (11_Block2, 12_Block2, 16_Block1, and 19_Block5) was found to have

202

the top significantly SNPs. The largest length of blocks was the 19_Block5 with the

203

length of 264 Kb. The haplotype association analysis revealed that a total of 12 blocks

204

was identified to be associated with milk production traits (Table 3). Interestingly, 3

205

blocks (11_Block2, 19_Block3, and 19_Block4) had significantly genetic effects on

206

all milk traits in buffaloes (P<0.05). The 8_Block2, 12_Block2, and 19_Block1 were

207

shown to be associated with milk protein percentage (PP) and fat percentage (FP) in

208

buffaloes (P<0.05). Moreover, we found that a total of 6 blocks (8_Block3,

209

12_Block1, 16_Block1, 19_Block2, 19_Block5, and 24_Block1) were associated with

210

milk yield (MY), fat yield (FY) or protein yield (PY) in buffaloes (P<0.05).

211

For the blocks harbored the top significantly SNPs, we further performed the

212

haplotype combination analysis in the present study (Table 4). Bonferroni analysis

213

revealed that buffaloes with diplotype H2H2 in 12_Block2 were highest significantly

214

associated with FP and PP than the other diplotype (P < 0.05). In the 11_Block2, the

215

individuals with diplotype H1H3 showed a higher MY, FY, and PY compared to

216

other diplotypes, while the diplotype H3H4 and H1H2 had the highest peak milk yield

217

(PM) and fat or protein percentages (P < 0.05), respectively. For 16_Block1,

218

buffaloes with diplotype H2H2 had highest significantly associated with PM, FY, and

219

PY, while the diplotype H1H4 exhibited the highest genetic effect on MY (P < 0.05).

220

Moreover, these buffaloes with the diplotype H2H4 in 19_Block5 displayed a higher

221

PM, MY, FY, and PY compared to other diplotypes (P < 0.05).

222

As shown in Table 5, a total of 7 genes and 1 lncRNA were predicted. For them,

223

the SLC9A3, EXOC3, AHRR, CEP72, PRB1, and TPPP genes in 19_Block5, while

224

FUT8 and LOC112587805 in 11_Block2, were served as the candidate genes

225

associated with buffalo milk production traits. However, no candidate gene was

226

discovered within the 12_Block2 and 16_Block1 regions.

227

Discussion

228

China is rich in buffalo resources that are mainly distributed in 18 provinces in the

229

central and south regions of the country. The Chinese buffalo breeds have a lower

230

milk production in comparison with river buffalo breeds. In this work, we performed a

231

population analysis of thirteen buffalo breeds in South China. PCA and phylogenetic

232

analysis both showed that two distinct clusters formed without overlap among the

233

studied breeds; ten indigenous Chinese buffaloes were clustered into the swamp

234

group, Murrah and Nili-Ravi breeds were grouped into the river group, while the

235

crossbred was concordantly located between the two groups. Population structures

236

analysis further showed that there was significant admixture, showing that the breeds

237

are genetically distinct between river and swamp groups. In this regard, we further

238

investigated the genetic diversity, LD and ROH, signatures of selection, and

239

identification of QTLs on the contrast model: the river (high milk production) vs.

240

swamp (low milk production) groups. These help in the understanding of the genetic

241

basis of milk production traits in dairy buffaloes, which promote the development of

242

dairy buffalo industry.

243

Using the medium density SNP chip data, we found that buffalo breeds in swamp

244

group had lower genetic diversity than that of the river group based on heterozygosity

245

measures. Similar results were also reported by Colli et al. [10]. In fact, Chinese

246

indigenous breeds sustain higher levels of genetic variability than river breeds. The

247

assumption was supported by previous reports that utilized microsatellite markers [38-

248

40] and mtDNA [41, 42]. This can be explained by the current buffalo 90K array is

249

optimized for use in four river buffalo breeds (Mediterranean, Murrah, Nili-Ravi, and

250

Jaffarabadi buffaloes) and has the lower representation of swamp breeds [43]. The

251

disproportionate distribution of MAF between river and swamp groups is another

252

reason to influence the SNP ascertainment bias. For example, buffalo breeds in

253

swamp group had the highest proportion of SNPs with lower MAF category compared

254

to the river group. The relatively high proportion of SNPs with high MAF in the

255

Chinese crossbred buffalo can be attributed to the fact that these buffaloes were recent

256

crossbreeds with a significantly high inheritance of Murrah and Nili-Ravi breeds

257

ancestry. Moreover, we also observed differences in the genetic differentiation among

258

the studied breeds. As expected FST among the swamp breeds was lower than the river

259

and crossbred breeds, ranging from 0.0076 to 0.7535, suggesting a lack of

260

differentiation among Chinese swamp breeds. This was lower than 0.52 observed

261

among the African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) breeds by Smitz, Berthouly (44), but

262

higher than the FST estimates reported in previous studies [45-47]. These differences

263

may be caused by the following: 1) small population effect sizes that may be resulted

264

in data error, 2) differences in buffalo breeds or geographical distribution, and 3)

265

differences in the estimated methods or markers density.

266

Analysis of the genome-wide LD decay plays a vital role in the GWAS mapping

267

of loci associated with economically important traits in livestock animals. Our

268

previous studies have demonstrated that the LD extent was different between purebred

269

and crossbred buffalo populations, with purebred having highest levels of LD [5]. In

270

this study, we estimated the LD extent between river and swamp groups, showing that

271

the LD decay in swamp group had declined markedly compared with the river group.

272

This result suggested that these buffaloes in swamp group had a higher genetic

273

diversity. Of note, LD extent across populations is much shorter in Chinese swamp

274

buffaloes than the river and crossbred buffaloes. The average distance over which LD

275

decay dropped to the value of 0.2 was approximately 15 Kb for swamp and 50 Kb for

276

river group, respectively. This finding was also supported by previous studies [5].

277

Moreover, it is well known that the Chinese indigenous breeds underwent a longer

278

time of domestication compared with the river breeds. The assumption was also

279

supported by the results from ROH analysis. The buffaloes in swamp group had the

280

lower fraction of ROH in short tract (0-2 Mb), while the river breed exhibit a higher

281

faction of ROH in long tract (>16 Mb). Interestingly, evidence indicated that ROH

282

could be used to assist with the interpretation of the inbreeding coefficient and give

283

insights about populations history [48, 49]; the short and long ROH can respectively

284

reflect the remote and recent inbreeding activity [50]. Apparently, our data showed

285

that the extensive remote and recent inbreeding activity was found in the swamp and

286

river group, respectively.

287

Understanding the signatures of selection detected within livestock breeds can

288

contribute to the identification of genomic regions that are or have been targeted by

289

selection [51]. Here, we performed the selective sweeps analysis between river and

290

swamp groups using hapFLK analysis. A total of 12 genomic regions was identified

291

with an average length of 4.24 Mb. In these regions, we found that a total of 12 top

292

significantly SNPs detected within 9 chromosomes, corresponding to 8 candidate

293

genes and 1 lncRNA (LOC112579725) fragment. Most of the candidate genes were

294

predicted to be associated with cell structure and function. For example, CHCHD3, as

295

the inner mitochondrial membrane scaffold protein, plays a role in cell growth and

296

oxygen consumption [52]. HYAL4 and its paralog gene SPAM1 has demonstrated to

297

be similar in structure to hyaluronidases that were one of the major

298

glycosaminoglycans of the extracellular matrix involved in cell proliferation,

299

migration, and differentiation [53-55]. ACVR1C is a type I receptor for the TGFB

300

family of signaling molecules that plays a role in cell differentiation, growth arrest,

301

and apoptosis [56]. Numerous studies have demonstrated that DEPTOR is the

302

negative regulator of the mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling pathways, which play a

303

vital role in cell growth, metabolism, and disease [57, 58]. TPPP has confirmed to

304

play a role in the polymerization of tubulin into microtubules that involved in the

305

multiple biological functions such as the cell migration, cilia and flagella,

306

development, and gene regulation [58-60].

307

QTL mapping is critical for the gene cloning, molecular-marker-assisted selection

308

breeding, and trait improvement, which has been widely used for animal [61] and

309

plant breeding [62]. To further identify the QTLs associated with milk production

310

traits in buffaloes, we performed the haplotypes analysis using a 0.5-Mb window

311

around the top significantly SNPs. To our acknowledgment, information on the

312

identification of QTLs associated with milk production traits in buffalo is limited. Liu

313

et al. [63] found that 2 genomic regions were found to associate with buffalo milk

314

production traits. Here, we discovered a total of 18 blocks within 6 chromosomes.

315

Among these blocks, 13 blocks were found to be significantly associated with the

316

milk production traits in buffaloes. Interestingly, 4 blocks (11_Block2, 12_Block2,

317

16_Block1, and 19_Block5) harbored the top significantly SNPs have also been

318

significantly associated with milk production traits in buffaloes (P <0.05). Notably,

319

the diplotype H2H2 in 12_Block2, H1H3 in 11_Block2, H2H2 in 16_Block1, and

320

H2H4 in 19_Block5 can consider as the dominant haplotype combinations related to

321

milk traits in buffaloes based on the Bonferroni analysis. For these QTL regions,

322

moreover, we found that some candidate genes can be predicted in the 11_Block2 and

323

19_Block5, while no candidate gene was discovered within the 12_Block2 and

324

16_Block1 regions. For the 11_Block2, the FUT8 was found to be a signaling

325

receptor involved in many physiological and pathological processes [64], implying

326

that this QTL might be related to cell growth. In the 19_Block5, the SLC9A3, EXOC3,

327

AHRR, CEP72, PRB1, and TPPP genes were predicted. As the AHRR participated in

328

the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) signaling cascade [65], CEP72 [66] and TPPP

329

[67] participated in the microtubule formation; the result suggested that these genes

330

might be related to the cell growth and differentiation. Notably, Basham et al. [68]

331

reportd that AHRR could mediate the AHR singnal patwahy to block milk production

332

in mammary epithelial cell and block transcription of the milk gene β-casein. SLC9A3

333

was the member of solute carrier

334

transduction, and amino acid as well as glucose transporter [69]. Although limited

family that played a vital role in the signal

335

information on these genes associated with milk production traits has been reported,

336

we have reason to assume that these candidate genes should have genetic effects on

337

milk production traits based on their biological function. Further research of these

338

candidate genes is warranted to explore the underlying molecular mechanism of the

339

phenotypic traits in buffaloes.

345

Sampling and Genotyping

346

A total of 176 unrelated buffaloes representing 13 breeds were included in the present

347

study (Table 1), and their geographical origin was shown in Fig 6. We collected a

348

total of 102 blood samples, of which 23 river and 20 crossbred buffaloes were from

349

BRI-CAAS, and 59 swamp buffaloes were collected from different villages in

350

Southwest China. Moreover, we obtained publicly available genotypic data from 74

351

buffaloes provided by Colli et al. [10].

352

Genomic DNA for each blood sample was isolated using the TIANamp Blood

353

DNA Kit [Tiangen Biotech (Beijing) Co., Ltd., Beijing, China]. Quality and quantity

354

of isolated DNA were detected using the NanoDrop2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo

355

Fisher Scientific, Wilmington, DE, USA) and 1.5% Gel electrophoresis, respectively.

356

SNP genotyping was performed using the Axiom® Buffalo Genotyping Array

357

(Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA). For the quality control, SNPs with MAF ≤ 0.05,

358

SNP call rate ≤ 95%, individual call rate ≤ 95% were excluded using the PLINK 1.9

359

[70]. After filtering the duplicate and unknown chromosomal SNPs, a total of 35,547

360

SNPs was used for subsequent analysis.

362

To explored the individuals' relationship in the analyzed breeds, we determined the

363

eigenvectors significance using EIGENSOFT 7.2 [71] software with the Tracey-

364

Widom test and visualized the PCA plot with in-house R scripts. PHYLIP 3.697 [72]

365

was conducted to calculate the distance matrix, and MEGA7 [73] was used to present

366

the neighbor-joining tree. Population structure among the analyzed buffaloes was

367

determined using the ADMIXTURE 1.3.0 [74] software with the cluster (K) number

368

set from 2 to 4. Admixture plots were further visualized using the Microsoft Office

369

Excel 2016.

370

Genetic diversity

371

Genome-wide genetic variability within buffalo breeds was measured by the Arlequin

372

3.5.2 [75] software with the three metrics: HO, He, and AR. Population differentiation

373

for the pairwise genetic differentiation FST value was measured using the adegenet [76]

374

R-package.

375

Linkage disequilibrium decay

376

Genome-wide LD was evaluated between river and swamp groups. To diminish the

377

SNP ascertainment bias, we randomly selected the same sample numbers (n=43) for

378

each group. For all pairs of SNPs, the pair-wise LD between river and swamp groups

379

was calculated and visualized using the PopLDdecay [77].

380

Identification of Runs of Homozygosity

381

ROH between river and swamp groups was detected using the sliding-window based

382

method implemented in detectRUNS [78] R-package with the following parameters:

383

windowSize=15, threshold=0.05, minSNP=20, and minDensity=1/50000. FROH on the

384

contrast model was calculated using the following equation:

385

386

𝐹𝑅𝑂𝐻𝑗 =

∑𝑘𝑙𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑡ℎ(𝑅𝑂𝐻𝑘)
L

,

where 𝑅𝑂𝐻𝑘 = the kth ROH in individual j’s genome and L = the total length of

387

the genome (or X-chromosome).

389

Selection signature analysis on the contrast model was performed using the hapFLK

390

1.4 [79] software. Briefly, we firstly performed LD pruning analysis and admixture

391

analysis to obtain the population IDs for hapFLK analysis, which was respectively

392

implemented in the PLINK1.9 and ADMIXTURE 1.3.0. The main parameters for LD

393

pruning analysis were as follows: a window size of 50 SNPs, a step size of 5 bp and

394

an r2 threshold of 0.5. In the hapFLK analysis, the number of clusters (-K) was set to

395

2, and the expectation maximization iterations (--nfit) were specified to 20. The

396

hapFLK values were adjusted using the following equation:

397

ℎ𝑎𝑝𝐹𝐿𝐾𝑎𝑑𝑗 =

ℎ𝑎𝑝𝐹𝐿𝐾 ‒ 𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛(ℎ𝑎𝑝𝐹𝐿𝐾)
,
𝑠𝑑(ℎ𝑎𝑝𝐹𝐿𝐾)

398

where the mean and sd values of hapFLK were calculated using the MASS R-

399

package. The q-values of hapFLKadj was computed using a chi-square distribution

400

with in-house R scripts. A q-value threshold of 0.01 was applied to limit the number

401

of false positives.

402

Haplotype and association analysis

403

Phenotypic and genotypic data for 489 Italian Mediterranean buffaloes was provided

404

by Liu et al. [63]. Phenotypic data for the peak milk yield (PM), total milk yield (MY),

405

fat yield (FY), fat percentage (FP), protein yield (PY), and protein percentage (PP)

406

was included during a 13-yr period (2002-2014). The identified genomic regions were

407

surveyed to construct haplotype blocks within 0.5 Mb of the top significantly SNPs

408

using HaploView 4.2 (Barrett et al., 2005). Association between each haplotype

409

combination and 6 milk production traits were performed using the SAS 9.4 (SAS

410

Institute Inc., Cary, NC) software with the following model:

411

𝑌𝑖𝑗𝑘𝑙𝑚 = 𝜇 + Hl + 𝑌𝑖 + 𝑆𝑘 + 𝑃𝑗 + 𝐵𝑚 + 𝑒𝑖𝑗𝑘𝑙𝑚,

412

where 𝑌𝑖𝑗𝑘𝑙𝑚 = the trait observation, μ = the overall mean, Hl = the fixed effect of

413

the lth herd (4 farms), 𝑌𝑖 = the fixed effect of the ith year, 𝑆𝑘 = the fixed effect of the

414

kth season of calving (2 seasons), 𝑃𝑗 = the fixed effect of the jth parity classes (1 to 7

415

and ≥8), 𝐵𝑚 = the fixed effect of the mth haplotype block, and 𝑒𝑖𝑗𝑘𝑙𝑚 = the random

effects was used. The threshold of P-value < 0.05 was used to identify the haplotype

418

blocks affecting buffalo milk traits identified as the candidate QTLs.

419

Gene Annotation

420

We annotated the identified regions under significant selection pressure using the

421

NCBI’s Genome Data Viewer on the buffalo genome (UOA_WB_1). Genes within a

422

region spanning 50 Kb upstream and downstream of the candidate selection regions

423

were annotated. Moreover, the identification of candidate genes within the QTLs was

424

also performed based on the current buffalo genome.
