tissues where clone fragmentation and aggregation is the dominant process at long times (6). Here, in contrast, our goal
is to explicitly include the effects of mechanical stresses on
growth of elastic tissues. An elastic description is typically
valid for plants (18, 19) and can be applied to animal tissues
like the Drosophila wing imaginal disc to the extent that cell
rearrangements are rare (20–24); moreover, the formalism we
adopt can be extended to encompass simple models of plastic
flow that allow for more frequent rearrangements (25). We
expect that noise will lead to growth non-uniformities and
thus to the uneven accumulation of cell mass; this, in turn,
will generate stresses that can feed back on local growth rates.
Ranft et al. (26) have shown that such mechanical feedbacks
cause the stress tensor to relax as if the tissue were a viscoelastic fluid; their treatment of noise, however, is limited
to fluctuations about zero average growth, where most of the
phenomena of interest here are absent.
On a very basic level, the idea of mechanical feedback on
growth is uncontroversial—cells obviously cannot grow indefinitely into space occupied by other cells, so some sort of contact
inhibition or crowding effects must be present. Whether cells
more generally adjust their growth rates to their mechanical environment is, however, less obvious. The idea that
negative feedback from mechanical stresses could damp out
cell density fluctuations was proposed in (27) and has since
been incorporated into a number of models (8, 18, 19, 28–37).
Clear experimental examples of mechanical feedback have been
more difficult to obtain (38, 39). Nonetheless, several studies
have argued that tissues both in culture (12, 40–42) and in
vivo (43–47) respond to mechanical stress by modulating the
rate and orientation of cell division or by inducing cell death
(42, 48–50). Clones of fast-growing cells in Drosophila wing
discs reduce their growth rate through mechanical feedback
(8), and similar behavior has been observed in plant systems
(19, 51) including the Arabidopsis sepal (10). In confluent
monolayers, contact inhibition slows mitosis (11, 15). Cell
aggregates (52–55) and bacterial populations (56) also appear
to respond to mechanical cues. Thus, it seems likely that some
mechanical feedback on growth is present in many tissues.
In what follows, we first introduce our basic framework,
which assumes linear elastic deformations about a uniformly
growing reference state and linear feedback of the stress tensor
on the local growth rate. We then consider the special case of
strictly isotropic growth, where we show that density-density
correlations generically decay with distance as a power law
and that mechanical feedback drives clone size variability to
zero on large scales. (Closely related results are obtained

Tissue growth is a fundamental aspect of development and is intrinsically noisy. Stochasticity has important implications for morphogenesis, precise control of organ size, and regulation of tissue composition and heterogeneity. Yet, the basic statistical properties of growing tissues, particularly when growth induces mechanical stresses
that can in turn affect growth rates, have received little attention.
Here, we study the noisy growth of elastic sheets subject to mechanical feedback. Considering both isotropic and anisotropic growth, we
find that the density-density correlation function shows power law
scaling. We also consider the dynamics of marked, neutral clones of
cells. We find that the areas (but not the shapes) of two clones are
always statistically independent, even when they are adjacent. For
anisotropic growth, we show that clone size variance scales like the
average area squared and that the mode amplitudes characterizing
clone shape show a slow 1/n decay, where n is the mode index.
This is in stark contrast to the isotropic case, where relative variations in clone size and shape vanish at long times. The high variability in clone statistics observed in anisotropic growth is due to the
presence of two soft modes—growth modes that generate no stress.
Our results lay the groundwork for more in-depth explorations of the
properties of noisy tissue growth in specific biological contexts.
tissue mechanics | noisy growth | clonal dynamics | mechanical feedback

rowth is central to biology and usually involves a level
of stochasticity (1–3). The presence of such noise can
have significant consequences for developmental processes like
morphogenesis and the regulation of organ size. Yet, relatively
little is known about quantitative aspects of stochastic growth.
Our goal here is to understand the interplay between noise
and mechanical feedback in growing elastic tissues. To that
end, we present a generic, continuum model of such tissues
and use it to study measurable features of tissue architecture
like density fluctuations and statistics of marked, neutral
clones. Our model makes a number of unexpected predictions,
including the presence of power law correlations in space and
the existence of soft modes that allow clone sizes to grow
diffusively, evading the effects of mechanical feedbacks that
might otherwise be expected to limit clone size variability.
In experiments, noise in growth has most often been probed
through the size and spatial distribution of clones of cells (4–
10), especially of neutral clones that are genetically identical
to surrounding tissue except for a clone marker. Cell density
variation has also been observed directly in culture (11–15)
and in fixed tissues (16), as have correlations in positions of
mitotic cells (1), and size asymmetry between contralateral
organs can be used as an indirect readout of noise levels (17).
Theoretically, the most thoroughly explored area is the
noisy dynamics of stem cell populations (4, 5, 9), where zerodimensional descriptions are often appropriate and spatial
crowding effects, when important, have been included at the
level of simple lattice models. Similar models apply to fluid

independently in (57).) We also find that the areas of neighboring clones are statistically uncorrelated. We then turn to
the more general case of locally anisotropic growth. Here, we
observe the appearance of soft modes, where faster growth of
one tissue region is exactly compensated by slower growth in
surrounding regions and elastic deformations so as to leave
the tissue completely stress-free; these modes can thus grow
without bound even in the presence of feedback. As a consequence, clone sizes display a standard deviation of order their
mean, in strong contrast to the isotropic case.

where Γ is a rank four tensor that incorporates mechanical
feedback and noise (see SI). We define ∂t to be a time derivative
taken at fixed Lagrangian coordinates R. (The SI discusses
how ∂t G with this convention is related to proposed expressions
for the time derivative at fixed Eulerian coordinates.)
Assuming that deviations from uniform growth are small,
we can expand Eq. 3 to linear order in stress feedbacks and
noise. The most general form allowed by symmetry is

We consider a flat epithelium undergoing isotropic, exponential
growth on average, with small, random deviations from this
average. Though many of our results can be generalized, we
limit ourselves here to two-dimensional tissues. At the macroscopic scale, we view the epithelium as an elastic continuum.
Growth then looks like local creation of mass, and non-uniform
growth can induce tissue deformations. We treat the simplest
case of an infinite tissue and ignore boundary effects.
With these assumptions, we define reference (Lagrangian)
coordinates {R} and material (Eulerian) coordinates {r}.
Each point on the tissue at time t is related to a point in
the reference coordinates by r = eγ0 t R + w, where γ0 is the
average growth rate and w the local deformation due to growth
fluctuations (Fig. 1). We focus primarily on γ0 > 0 but show
in the Supporting Information (SI) that we recover known
results (26) when γ0 = 0.
Growth is represented by the symmetric second rank tensor
G(R) (see, e.g., (25)). Its principal components give the tissue’s preferred dilation—that is, the factor by which the tissue
particle at R must expand to remain stress free—along the two
e (R),
principal axes. It can be decomposed as G(R) = Ḡ1 + G
where the scalar Ḡ = eγ0 t describes the spatially uniform,
e (R) represents
average tissue expansion, and the tensor G
fluctuations about the average.
We assume that growth is slow enough that the tissue is
always at mechanical equilibrium; absent any external forces
or confinement, spatially uniform growth then should not
generate any mechanical stress, which will instead be caused
e of the growth
entirely by the spatially-varying component G
e
tensor. In the limit of weak fluctuations in growth rate, G
and w will both be small, and we can linearize at each instant
about the uniformly dilated state. The resulting theory has
a form familiar from thermoelasticity (58, 59). We define a
strain-like tensor wij = (∂i wj + ∂j wi )/2, where ∂i denotes

where we have also dropped higher order gradient terms (whose
effects are addressed in the SI). The constants c and c(d) give
the strengths of the stress feedbacks (the superscript (d) stands
for deviatoric), and ξij is a noise term.
Density. Within continuum elasticity, it is natural to define
a density ρ(R, t) of the deformed material. For a complex
biological tissue, ρ of course does not represent the total mass
density but instead can be thought of as roughly the density
of materials (like cytoskeletal proteins) that give the tissue an
elastic rigidity or, equivalently, as a measure of elastic tissue
compression or expansion relative to an ideal, unstressed state.
If we call the (uniform) density in the stress-free configuration

If all cells in the tissue have the same preferred apical area,
then ρ is proportional to the cell density. Even if that is not
the case, as long as cells’ relaxed areas are uncorrelated, the
difference between the cell density and√the average of ρ over
a region of area A will decrease as 1/ A, allowing the cell
density to be used to estimate ρ on long enough scales.

are known cluster in some tissues (1, 24)). Estimates of the
exponent 2k/γ0 could be used to determine the strength c of

Clone Statistics. Following marked, neutral clones has proven

to be a useful tool to track growth and development (4–10).
Here, we examine the size and shape statistics of clones in
a growing tissue. Starting from a circular clone, we derive
expressions for the variance of the clone area and of mode
amplitudes characterizing the clone shape.

Here, k = 2µ(λ + µ)c/(λ + 2µ), and the (scalar) noise ξ(R, t)
is delta correlated in time and spatially correlated on a length
scale a of order a cell radius; this small but non-zero correlation length is needed to prevent pathological behavior
and reflects the fact that cell growth and division are correlated on the scale of a single cell. Because typical cell sizes
remain constant as the tissue grows, the correlation length
should be viewed as fixed in Eulerian coordinates, so that

For isotropic growth, both w and ∇.w can be written in
terms of δρ, so Eq. 6 is all we need to evaluate Eqs. 8 and 9. We
find that the variances in clone size and shape become small
compared to the mean at long times: limt→∞ Var(A)/ hAi2 →
0 and limt→∞ |Bn |2 /B02 → 0. Thus, for isotropic growth,
all sufficiently old clones are statistically similar. This is a
direct consequence of the mechanical feedback that causes δρ
to relax exponentially to zero; we will see in the next section
that once growth is allowed to be locally anisotropic, soft
modes lead to dramatically different behavior.
Before introducing anisotropy, we note that our model also
predicts that the areas of two nearby clones are uncorrelated:
If the deviations from the mean clone areas are ∆A1 and
∆A2 , then h∆A1 ∆A2 i = 0. This follows immediately from the
elastic response of an infinite tissue to localized growth (8):
e ∼ δ(R), w ∼ R̂/R, and ∇.w = 0 except at the origin.

only clones that actually contain the origin change their area

where the pre-factor is O(k/γ0 ) (see SI). Fig. S1 plots the full
correlation function versus r/a.
To understand this behavior, suppose that noise generates a density fluctuation initially correlated on a length
scale a. Over time, growth will advect this fluctuation outwards while mechanical feedback will cause its amplitude
to decay. After time t, the initial, small-scale fluctuation
will induce correlations up to a scale r ∼ a eγ0 t , but δρ
will have decayed like e−kt (so that the correlation function is smaller by a factor e−2kt ). For a given r, fluctuations that happened around t∗ (r) = log(r/a)1/γ0 ago
are dominant; earlier fluctuations have died out while later
ones have not yet reached the distance r. Thus, we expect
hδρ(r)δρ(0)i ∼ exp[−2kt∗ (r)] ∼ (r/a)−2k/γ0 . A similar mechanism produces power law correlations in inflationary models
of the early universe (60). This result requires a small but
finite initial correlation length for fluctuations. In the SI, we
extend our results to the case where this lengthscale is set by
gradient terms in the growth dynamics as well as to unequal
time correlations in arbitrary dimension.
Qualitatively, our finding of power law correlations says
that cells in growing epithelia are more clumped together on
large scales than for a totally random spatial distribution,
with the effect becoming more pronounced for smaller k/γ0 .
Correlations in cell density are experimentally accessible (13–
16), and we expect that similar clumping should be observed

Anisotropic Growth
Cells in both animal (41, 43, 44) and plant (51) tissues have
been shown to orient their divisions relative to the principal
axis of an applied stress. Thus, in general, we should consider
stress-dependent, local growth anisotropies. If we continue

Eq. 4 and find expressions for density-density correlations and
clone statistics. We will see that density-density correlations
follow the same power law behavior as in Eq. 7, but that new
soft modes appear which cause clone size and shape variability
to remain large even at long times.

Soft Modes. As just shown, in two dimensions growth has two

[11]

soft modes. They have the same physical origin: A nonunie induces a displacement w that exactly
form growth field G
cancels the growth, so that no mechanical stress or density
change results. Fig. 2B illustrates this for the longitudinal
mode. In essence, excess mass created by faster growth in
one part of the tissue is transported to slower-growing parts
so as to equalize the tissue density. What is remarkable is
that, for certain patterns of growth, this redistribution can be
accomplished in an elastic tissue—thus without viscous flow
or cell neighbor exchanges—without causing shear stresses or
mechanical feedback. Specifically, Eq. 13 implies that only
e22 component of
growth perpendicular to Q—i.e., only the G
e , if Q points in the 1 direction—induces density changes that
G
can then generate stresses (Eq. 12). In contrast, growth parallel to Q (ZL ) or at a 45° angle (ZT ) is exactly compensated
by elastic deformations.
From Eqs. 15–16, one might imagine that the soft modes
grow without bound. This, however, turns out not to be the
case: The modes are defined at fixed Lagrangian wavevector
Q, but ξ⊥ and ξk have constant correlations in Eulerian space.
As growth progresses, a given Q corresponds to longer and
longer Eulerian lengthscales, leading to a decrease in the noise
amplitude with time. As a result (see SI), the mean squared
values of ZL and ZT remain bounded for all times.

Finally, we have the stress tensor:

Having found the stress, we next turn to the time evolution of G. The noise ξij in Eq. 4 now has three independent
components. We define ξll , ξk , and ξ⊥ in analogy to the corresponding quantities in Eq. 10 and take them to be independent,
Gaussian random variables; rotational invariance requires that
ξk and ξ⊥ have the same strength which can, however, differ
from that of ξll . As in the isotropic case, we choose these
random variables to be delta correlated in time but colored in
space to avoid pathological behavior (see SI).
Substituting Eq. 12 for the stress into the growth dynamics
Eq. 4, we find that the dynamics can be decomposed into three

Density-density Correlations. As in the isotropic case, we can
calculate density-density correlation functions for anisotropic
growth. From Eq. 14, it is evident that the only differences
between the two cases are the feedback strength and the
presence of a second noise term ξk . The latter will only affect
the pre-factors. We thus find that

Clone Statistics. In the isotropic case, where δρ was the only

dynamical variable, mechanical feedback caused clone size
and shape variations to decay in time relative to the average
dilation. However, if we allow growth anisotropies, ∇.w and
w, which are the relevant variables for clone properties (Eqs.
8 and 9), depend on the soft modes as well as on the density.

a linear, elastic continuum (SI and (8)); this is consistent with
the fact that known examples of such behavior, like cell competition (62), appear to depend on the activation of specific
signaling pathways rather than on generic mechanical effects.
One limitation of our results is that they ignore clone
disappearance and fragmentation. Such events should be vanishingly unlikely for fast enough growth or large enough initial
clone area, but can skew size distributions in the opposite
limits (4). Thus, our findings are most directly applicable to
tissues where the rate of cell division is much higher than of
cell death or to situations where clones can be imaged over
time (7), so that it is possible to quantify a clone’s incremental
growth after it has reached some threshold size.
We emphasize that the soft modes in our model are distinct
from stress relaxation due to tissue fluidization (26). Whereas
in the latter case, stress decays exponentially in time, for soft
modes it is identically zero. Our soft modes are related to
harmonic growth (28, 63, 64), which likewise does not generate
any stress. This phenomenon, however, occurs in finite tissues
with isotropic growth and appropriate boundary conditions.
Here, anisotropic soft modes are integral to the structure of
the growth problem even in the absence of boundary effects.
Our model is the simplest that incorporates noise in the
growth control problem. It ignores the influences both of
boundaries and of frictional forces. Friction always dominates
for large enough growing tissues (65), but its effects can be
small when growth is slow or sources of drag are weak (as,
e.g., for plant tissues growing in air). By assuming a solid
tissue, we also neglect the possibility of cell rearrangements
(T1 transitions) and flow. This assumption usually holds
for plant cells (18, 19). In animal epithelia, flows and T1’s
are sometimes significant (6), but there are also cases that
exhibit more solid-like behavior. The Drosophila wing disc,
for example, clearly supports circumferential stresses without
yielding (43, 44), and cell shapes and packing are consistent
with a solid rather than a fluid-like phase (66). Despite some
differences in measured rates of T1’s in ex vivo discs (22,
24) and of clone dispersal (20, 21, 23), these are consistent
with predominantly solid behavior with possibly some plastic
slippage. Thus, it is reasonable to treat the disc as an elastic
solid in a first approximation. Moreover, plastic deformations
can be described with the same multiplicative decomposition
of the deformation gradient used in morphoelasticity (SI), so
that incorporating a simple version of plasticity into our model
requires nothing more than renormalizing the coefficients in
the time evolution of G (Eq. 4) (25).
Our calculations also assume weak noise and hence small
deformations. Importantly, this approximation is valid and
self-consistent even with soft modes, because the soft mode
amplitude is proportional to the noise strength and remains
bounded at long times. Nonetheless, it would be of interest
to explore what happens for stronger noise and larger deformations. Indeed, the physics of nonequilibrium growth has a
long and rich history (e.g. (67)), and from this perspective
volumetric tissue growth represents an entirely new class of
problems. Notably, we expect that the basic physics of soft
modes survives the transition to the nonlinear regime. In the
nonlinear case, it is convenient to characterize growth by a
“target metric” (equal to GT G); if this metric lacks intrinsic
curvature, it can always be compensated by a displacement
field w and so will not generate any stresses (25, 68).

The pre-factors are O(1) if Rc ∼ a, i.e. the clone is initially the
size of a single cell. Adjacent clones’ areas are uncorrelated,
just as in the isotropic case (Fig. 2A).
Eq. 18 says that the areas of large clones are just as variable
as those of small clones. Such behavior would be normal for
an exponentially growing population with no constraints on its
size (61), but it is quite unexpected for a clone embedded in
an elastic tissue and subject to mechanical feedback. In effect,
soft modes allow the growth to be as noisy as if feedback were
absent. Together with our finding that the areas of different
clones are uncorrelated, this result means that even elastically
coupled clones behave in many ways as if they were growing
independently and without feedback.

Discussion
We presented a simple model of noisy growth of elastic tissues
with mechanical feedback. This model predicts nontrivial
behavior for experimentally accessible quantities including
density-density correlation functions and clone size statistics.
We first showed that density correlations decay in space as
a power law whose exponent depends on the average growth
rate and feedback coefficient. Using our result, it should be
possible to estimate the strength c + c(d) of the mechanical
feedback, a quantity that has not so far been measured in
growing tissues. Somewhat counterintuitively, the sign of c(d)
seems to be negative in some plant systems (51). We find that
this does not destabilize growth as long as c + c(d) > 0.
We then studied marked, neutral clones, whose statistics
depend strongly on whether local growth anisotropies are allowed. In their absence, mechanical feedback tends to prevent
fluctuations on large scales, and size variation becomes much
smaller than the mean for large clones. This behavior changes
dramatically for anisotropic growth, where soft modes allow
certain deformations to escape any negative feedback. As
a consequence, the standard deviation in clone area grows
like the mean, exactly as if the clone were an exponentially
growing aggregate of independently dividing cells completely
indifferent to the presence of surrounding tissue (61). Similarly, fluctuations in clone shape remain large when growth
is anisotropic and soft modes dominate. Strikingly, we also
find that the areas of different clones are always uncorrelated.
These conclusions together imply that (at least to within the
weak noise approximation inherent in our calculations) neutral clone areas have the same statistical properties in elastic
tissues as in systems where mechanical feedback and crowding
effects are completely absent.
Our calculations also show more generally that overgrowth
of one clone (whether or not neutral) cannot induce undergrowth in nearby tissue solely through mechanical feedback in

The formalism presented here can also be extended to include less generic effects, like inhomogeneous growth driven by
morphogen gradients and chemical signaling, that are nonetheless crucial to many examples of morphogenesis and organ
size control (29, 30, 33). Our work is thus a first step towards
more comprehensive models of specific biological systems.
