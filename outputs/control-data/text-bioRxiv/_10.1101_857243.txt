Abstract

20

Loss of tolerance to nuclear antigens and multisystem tissue destruction is a hallmark of

21

systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Although the source of autoantigen in lupus

22

remains elusive, a compelling hypothetical source is dead cell debris that drives

23

autoimmune activation. Prior reports suggest that neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs)

24

and their associated death pathway, NETosis, are sources of autoantigen in SLE.

25

However, others and we have shown that inhibition of NETs by targeting the NADPH

26

oxidase complex and peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PADI4) did not ameliorate disease in

27

spontaneous murine models of SLE. Furthermore, myeloperoxidase and PADI4 deletion

28

did not inhibit induced lupus. Since NET formation may occur independently of any one

29

mediator, to address this controversy, we genetically deleted an additional important

30

mediator of NETs and neutrophil effector function, neutrophil elastase (ELANE), in the

31

MRL.Faslpr model of SLE. ELANE deficiency, and by extension ELANE-dependent NETs,

32

had no effect on SLE nephritis, dermatitis, anti-self response, or immune composition in

33

MRL.Faslpr mice. Taken together with prior data from our group and others, these data

34

further challenge the paradigm that NETs and neutrophils are pathogenic in SLE.

Introduction

36
37

SLE is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by the formation of autoantibodies

38

to nucleic acids and the proteins to which these nucleic acids associate [1]. Loss of

39

tolerance to self-antigens results in immune activation and tissue destruction [1]. Although

40

the origin of autoantigens in SLE are not known, the liberation of antigenic contents from

41

dying cells is considered a likely culprit.

42
43

Neutrophils are postulated to play a critical role in SLE pathogenesis by secreting pro-

44

inflammatory cytokines, directly mediating end organ injury, and by forming neutrophil

45

extracellular traps (NETs) [2]. NETs are extruded DNA structures coated with granular

46

and cytoplasmic contents that are released into the extracellular environment. There is

47

substantial disagreement and controversy about the definition of a NET, how to detect

48

and quantify NETs, and what the triggers of and molecular pathways resulting in NET

49

formation are, as summarized in a recent consensus document [3]. These outstanding

50

issues in the NET field make it difficult to study the causative role for NETs in biological

51

processes and diseases.

52
53

Classical NET generation in humans and mice relies on NADPH oxidase-generated

54

reactive oxygen species (ROS) [4-6]. However, rapid NADPH oxidase-independent NET

55

formation, nuclear DNA externalization without concomitant cell lysis, and extrusion of

56

mitochondrial DNA have been described [3]. In addition to NADPH oxidase,

57

peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PADI4) [7-13], neutrophil elastase (ELANE) [10, 14-17],

58

and myeloperoxidase (MPO) [18, 19] have been identified as critical mediators of NET

59

formation.

60
61

It is a compelling paradigm that NETs could be a source of autoantigen and a downstream

62

mediator of end-organ damage in SLE. NETs are present in the peripheral blood, skin,

63

and kidneys of SLE patients and mice [2]. Early studies suggested that pharmacological

64

inhibition of PADI4 via pan-PAD inhibition with CL- and BB-CL- Amidine mildly improved

65

clinical manifestations of SLE in murine models [20, 21]. However, the NET hypothesis

66

has recently been challenged by studies that have either genetically deleted or

67

pharmacologically inhibited important NET mediators in multiple murine models of SLE.

68

Genetic deletion of critical NADPH oxidase complex components, required for the

69

neutrophil oxidative burst in addition to ROS-dependent NET formation, exacerbated SLE

70

in mice [22, 23], an observation that also extends to humans [24, 25]. Genetic deletion of

71

padi4 did not improve clinical or immunological manifestations of SLE in the MRL.Faslpr

72

and pristane induced lupus (PIL) mouse models [23, 26]. In fact, disease was

73

exacerbated in the latter [23, 26]. Pharmacological inhibition of the PADI family of

74

enzymes by Cl-amidine had no impact on two inducible models of nephritis [26]. MPO-

75

deficient mice subjected to PIL have increased proteinuria and glomerulonephritis [27].

76

While these data argue against a role for neutrophils and NETs in SLE pathogenesis, it

77

remains possible that PADI4, CYBB, and MPO independent NETs or other neutrophil

78

effector functions could drive disease.

80

To address this controversy, it is necessary to use additional genetic approaches to block

81

NET formation. We reason that while the case for NETs driving lupus could posit that one

82

or even more canonical members of the NET cascade would be dispensable specifically

83

in the case of lupus, it would be unlikely that multiple such molecules would all be

84

dispensable. Therefore, to further probe the hypothesis that NETs drive lupus, we decided

85

to genetically target the serine protease elane, since multiple studies both directly [10,

86

14-17] and indirectly [28-31] implicate ELANE in NET formation in mice and humans.

87

ELANE, the second most abundant protein in NETs, is critical for NET formation,

88

functioning by modulating F-actin dynamics and degrading histones important for

89

chromatin decondensation [15]. In addition to its active role in NET formation, ELANE

90

decorates NET structures and is proteolytically active in this setting [32]. Moreover,

91

ELANE is important for neutrophil effector function and can directly mediate tissue

92

damage upon neutrophil degranulation [33]. Therefore, ELANE has the potential to be an

93

effective therapeutic target in SLE.

94
95

To directly compare elane to both cybb- and padi4- deficiency in the context of SLE

96

pathogenesis, we elected to eliminate elane in the MRL.Faslpr mouse model of lupus. The

97

MRL.Faslpr model is a leading system to study SLE as it recapitulates nearly all features

98

of the human disease and has accurately predicted responses in human translational

99

studies [34].

100
101

Here, we show that genetic deletion of elane did not have any impact on clinical or

102

immunological parameters of SLE in MRL.Faslpr mice. Taken together with earlier work

103

[22, 23, 26], these findings add additional evidence that challenges the concept that

104

neutrophils and NETs, to the degree that NET generation and neutrophil effector function

105

relies on PADI4 [7-13], ELANE [10, 14-17], or CYBB [4-6], critically drives lupus.

MRL.Faslpr SLE cohorts were analyzed as previously described [22, 35]. Skin disease

124

was scored based on the extent of dermatitis on the dorsum of the neck and back.

125

Macroscopic surface area was scored from 0 to 5 for an affected area up to 9.1 cm2, with

126

up to 1 additional point for the presence of ear (1/4 point each) and muzzle (1/2 point)

Flow Cytometry

135

Flow cytometry was performed as previously described [22]. In brief, spleens and bone

136

marrow were homogenized and red blood cells were lysed using Ammonium-Chloride-

137

Potassium buffer (prepared in house). Cells were resuspended in Phosphate Buffered

138

Saline (PBS) with 3% calf serum and the FcR-blocking antibody 2.4G2. Live/dead

139

discrimination was performed using fixable viability stain 510 (BD) or ethidium monoazide

140

bromide (Invitrogen). Surface and intracellular staining antibodies are listed below. Cells

Results

190
191

To assess the role of elane-deficiency in SLE, we utilized the elane-Cre allele, which does

192

not produce functional ELANE protein. Homozygous elane deficiency does not

193

substantially alter granulocyte development and recruitment [42]. We backcrossed the

194

elane-Cre allele onto the MRL.Faslpr background for 9 generations. Heterozygous mice

195

were then intercrossed to produce an experimental cohort. SLE pathology was analyzed

196

at 17 weeks of age.

197
198

Elane deficiency had no effect on nephritis or dermatitis

199

No differences in urine protein were detected across elane genotypes in either male or

200

female cohorts (Fig 1A). Elane deficiency resulted in no significant alterations in

201

glomerulonephritis or interstitial nephritis (Fig 1B). No statistically significant differences

202

in dermatitis were detected among the different elane genotypes in either cohort (Fig 1C).

203

Similarly, elane genotype did not alter splenomegaly or lymphadenopathy (Fig 1D).

Elane genotype has no impact on loss of tolerance and the anti-self response

216

To determine the effect of ELANE on the autoantibody response in SLE, we characterized

217

the ANA patterns in elane-sufficient and -deficient MRL.Faslpr mice. No differences were

218

identified in the dominant ANA pattern or staining intensity across groups (Supplemental

219

Fig 1A). ELANE deficiency did not alter anti-chromatin autoantibodies as no differences

220

in mitotic chromatin staining were observed (Supplemental Fig 1B). Concordant with

221

these data, we did not detect any changes in anti-RNA antibody (Fig 2A), anti-Sm

222

antibody (Fig 2B), anti-nucleosome antibody (Fig 2C), and rheumatoid factor (Fig 2D)

223

titers by ELISA among the groups.

238

Elane-genotype did not affect the percentages of CD19+ B cells (Fig 3D) or CD19low-int

239

CD44+ CD138+ intracellular khigh AFCs (Fig 2E, right panel). Similarly, there were no

240

statistically significant differences in total kappa Ig AFC ELISpots (Fig 2E, left panel).

241

Wild-type female mice had a higher number of IgG1 AFCs compared to their elane-

242

deficient MRL.Faslpr counterparts (Fig 2F, p=0.0141). This finding is unlikely to be

243

biologically significant, as these data were not mirrored across gender. No differences

244

were identified in IgG2a and IgM AFC ELISpots amongst the groups (Fig 2G & H).

246

ELANE deficiency did not substantially change the myeloid compartment

247

Elane genotype had only a minor impact on the myeloid compartment in MRL.Faslpr mice.

248

The percentages of CD11b+Ly6G+ (Fig 3A, left panel) bone marrow (BM) neutrophils and

249

CD11b+F4/80+Gr1low-int BM macrophages (Fig 3B, right panel) were not statistically

250

different among the groups. Additionally, no changes in CD11b+Ly6G+ (Fig 3B, left panel)

251

splenic neutrophils or CD11b+F4/80+Gr1low-int (Fig 3B, right panel) splenic macrophages

252

were identified across elane genotypes. Female wild-type mice had a greater percentage

253

of splenic cDCs compared to the elane-/- group (Fig 3C, left panel, p=0.0039). No

254

differences in the percentages of CD19-BST2+ SiglecH+ pDCs (Fig 3C, right panel) were

255

identified among elane genotypes.

Discussion

279
280

The data from the genetic study presented here in a relevant murine model of lupus does

281

not support the hypothesis that ELANE, and by extension ELANE-dependent NET

282

generation and neutrophil effector function, alters immune system composition or

283

pathology in SLE. This conclusion is reinforced by prior work from our group and that of

284

others targeting PADI4 in SLE and nephritis models that yielded similar results [23, 26].

285

Moreover, NADPH deficiency exacerbates SLE in mice and humans. It remains unknown

286

whether this phenotype is neutrophil or NET dependent as NADPH oxidase is implicated

287

in immunoregulatory functions in both the myeloid and lymphoid compartments [43].

288
289

In humans, elane mutations are generally associated with congenital neutropenias but

290

not systemic autoimmunity [44]. However, a recent study identified a patient with a novel

291

loss of function polymorphism (G210R) in exon 5 of elane that did not confer congenital

292

neutropenia, but the patient did exhibit inflammatory arthritis and recurrent parvovirus

293

infections [14]. Concordant with previous observations, NET formation was defective in

294

this patient. Moreover, patients with Papillon-Lefèvre syndrome (PLS), characterized by

295

mutations that inactivate Cathepsin C, a cysteine protease that processes ELANE into its

296

active state [30, 45], develop severe periodontitis. While systemic autoimmune

297

syndromes are not typically associated with PLS, a pediatric patient with PLS who

298

subsequently developed SLE has been reported [46]. Similarly, NET generation was

299

found to be defective in PLS patients [30, 45]. Loss of function mutations in endogenous

300

ELANE inhibitors, such as secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor and Serpin Family B

301

Member 1, are associated with increased NET formation but their role in systemic

302

autoimmunity has not been extensively investigated [28, 29].

303
304

It was conceivable that ELANE protease activity could cleave self-antigens, thus

305

impacting their immunogenicity. Proteases have been suggested as sources to generate

306

novel immunogenic forms of self-antigens [47]. However, ELANE deficiency did not alter

307

the anti-self response nor clinical parameters of SLE in the MRL.Faslpr model, ruling out

308

one possible source of proteases that could fuel such a mechanism of loss of tolerance

309

in autoimmunity.

310
311

NADPH oxidase-deficient mice subjected to a monosodium urate crystal induced model

312

of chronic neutrophilic inflammation, a model of gout, developed more severe arthritis

313

[48]. This phenotype was attributed to the inability of NADPH oxidase-deficient mice to

314

generate aggregated NETs to degrade proinflammatory mediators. Moreover, the

315

adoptive transfer of aggregated NETs into these animals reduced disease severity [48].

316

Aggregated NETs can degrade cytokines in an ELANE- dependent manner, as treatment

317

of these structures with multiple elastase inhibitors prevented the degradation of

318

cytokines and chemokines [48]. These data coupled with the exacerbated disease

319

observed in cybb-deficient SLE prone mice and padi4-deficient mice subjected to the PIL

320

model suggests a homeostatic function for NETs in autoimmunity.

321
322

While many groups have implicated ELANE as a critical mediator of NET formation [10,

323

14-17, 28-31], a few reports suggest that NETs can occur in the absence of ELANE. In

16

324

one report, immune complexes induced ELANE-independent and FcgrIIA-dependent

325

NET formation in normal neutrophils [49]. Another report concluded that neutrophils from

326

elane-deficient mice or wild-type neutrophils pretreated with ELANE inhibitors did form

327

NETs in response to canonical NET inducing stimuli, such as PMA and calcium

328

ionophores [50]. In this study, elane-deficient mice formed NETs in an experimental

329

model of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and ELANE deficiency did not protect mice from

330

DVT in this model [50]. Since PADI4 deficiency and pharmacological inhibition reduces

331

NET formation in lupus and PADI4 pharmacological inhibition or genetic deletion does

332

not impact SLE pathogenesis [23, 26], and given the large number of reports implicating

333

ELANE in NET formation, it seems unlikely that ELANE-independent NETs drive

334

autoimmunity in this setting.

335
336

The multiple studies that blocked or deleted mediators of NET formation but which did not

337

observe ameliorated disease raise a broader question as to the role of neutrophils per se

338

in lupus pathogenesis. Infiltration of neutrophils into the kidney has been identified in both

339

SLE patients and in multiple murine models of the disease [51]. Despite these

340

associations, it is striking that nearly 20-50% of SLE patients are neutropenic [52, 53]

341

and/or have abnormal neutrophil function. SLE neutrophils display reduced superoxide

342

production [54] and phagocytosis [55]; however, low density granulocytes (LDGs)—a

343

neutrophil subset enriched in SLE patients—produce type I interferons and

344

proinflammatory cytokines [56]. Animal models of lupus have not supported a pathogenic

345

role for neutrophils in SLE pathogenesis; rather, data has supported a regulatory or

346

neutral role for neutrophils. Antibody mediated depletion of neutrophils early in disease

347

increased autoantibody titers and glomerulonephritis in the NZB/W model [57, 58].

348

However, neutrophil depletion did not alter autoantibody responses nor renal pathology

349

in established disease [57]. Conditional deletion of neutrophils in mice subjected to the

350

PIL model resulted in increased antinuclear antibody responses [23].

351
352

The major message from the current studies comes from interpreting them in the context

353

of other genetic and inhibitor studies that have probed whether NETs and neutrophils

354

promote lupus. Our work adds ELANE to the list of CYBB and PAD4 as proteins that are

355

required for NET formation, yet are not needed for lupus. While in each case, it could be

356

argued that the type of NET generation seen in SLE proceeds independently of the protein

357

in question, it seems unlikely that the putative type of NET generation that is hypothesized

358

to critically drive lupus is independent of three of the major pathways documented to be

359

important for NET formation. This point, which is punctuated by the current data, along

360

with the lack of a role for neutrophils per se in driving lupus, heralds a juncture at which

361

the field should seriously reevaluate whether the “NETs drive lupus” hypothesis remains

362

valid and whether blocking NET formation or neutrophil function makes sense as a

363

therapeutic strategy. In contrast, multiple studies have shown regulatory roles in various

364

systems for CYBB, and to an extent PAD4 and MPO, such that disease is exacerbated

365

in their absence [22, 23, 26, 27, 59]. We would thus posit that neutrophils and their effector

366

mechanisms, such as NET generation, may have evolved to protect us from autoimmune

367

diseases, rather than function as vectors to promote them.
