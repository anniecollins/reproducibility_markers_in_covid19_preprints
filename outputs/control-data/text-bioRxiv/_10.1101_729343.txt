Summary

31

Herpesviruses are ubiquitous in the human population and they extensively remodel the

32

cellular environment during infection. Multiplexed quantitative proteomic analysis over a

33

whole time-course of herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 infection was used to characterize

34

changes in the host-cell proteome and to probe the kinetics of viral protein production.

35

Several host-cell proteins were targeted for rapid degradation by HSV-1, including the

36

cellular trafficking factor GOPC. We identify that the poorly-characterized HSV-1 protein

37

pUL56 binds directly to GOPC, stimulating its ubiquitination and proteasomal

38

degradation. Plasma membrane profiling revealed that pUL56 mediates specific changes

39

to the surface proteome of infected cells, including loss of IL18 receptor and Toll-like

40

receptor 2, and delivery of Toll-like receptor 2 to the cell-surface requires GOPC. Our

41

study highlights an unanticipated and efficient mechanism whereby a single virus protein

42

targets a cellular trafficking factor to modify the abundance of multiple signaling molecules

43

at the surface of infected cells.

Introduction

46

Herpesviruses are ubiquitous in the human population and are characterized by

47

an ability to establish lifelong infections. Greater than two thirds of the world population

48

are estimated to be infected with HSV-1 and HSV-2 (Looker et al., 2008; Looker et al.,

49

2015). These infections are generally asymptomatic or give rise to mild symptoms

50

following viral reactivation (oral or genital sores), although they can cause severe

51

diseases of the eye (herpes keratitis), central nervous system (herpes encephalitis), or

52

systemic infections in those with compromised or immature immune systems (Gnann and

53

Whitley, 2017; Koujah et al., 2019; Pinninti and Kimberlin, 2018).

54

The replication cycle of herpesviruses entails a complex and carefully controlled

55

transcriptional cascade of viral genes that function both to generate infectious particles

56

and to modulate host factors. HSV-1 genes are conventionally separated into three broad

57

temporal classes (immediate-early, early, and late), where proteins expressed earliest

58

during infection serve as transcription factors and/or modulate the host-cell environment

59

and immune responses, while those expressed late are structural components of the

60

virion. The best-studied HSV-1 immunomodulatory proteins are infected cell protein 0

61

(ICP0) and virion host shutoff protein (vhs). These proteins are known to modulate the

62

host-cell proteome by suppressing the expression and/or promoting the degradation of

63

various host proteins (Boutell et al., 2011; Chelbi-Alix and de The, 1999; Jiang et al.,

64

2016; Lees-Miller et al., 1996; Lilley et al., 2011; Orzalli et al., 2013; Su and Zheng, 2017;

65

Zenner et al., 2013). However, the global temporal effects of HSV-1 replication on the

66

host proteome remain poorly characterized. To date there has been one large-scale

67

proteomic analysis of HSV-1 infection. This work, performed in fibroblasts, quantified the

68

abundance of approximately 4000 host proteins and characterized changes in protein

69

post-translational modification following infection (Kulej et al., 2017). However, the

70

molecular mechanisms underlying these changes were not characterized.

71

We developed quantitative temporal viromics (QTV) as a method to enable highly-

72

multiplexed quantitative analysis of temporal changes in host and viral proteins

73

throughout the course of a productive infection (Weekes et al., 2014). QTV employs

74

tandem mass tags (TMT) and MS3 mass spectrometry to facilitate precise quantitation of

75

each protein, and we have applied this technique to study several viruses including

76

human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), Epstein-Barr virus, vaccinia virus, and BK polyomavirus

77

(Caller et al., 2019; Ersing et al., 2017; Soday et al., 2019; Weekes et al., 2014).

78

We have now performed QTV analysis throughout a single replication cycle of

79

HSV-1 in human keratinocytes, the natural target of HSV-1 lytic infection. At each time

80

point we quantified almost 7000 human proteins and >90% of canonical HSV-1 proteins,

81

and we have found evidence for protein expression from 17 novel HSV-1 open reading

82

frames (ORFs). We have identified host proteins that are rapidly degraded by HSV-1,

83

including the cellular trafficking factor Golgi associated PDZ and Coiled-coil motif

84

containing protein (GOPC). Further, we demonstrate that GOPC degradation is mediated

85

by the poorly-characterized HSV-1 protein pUL56. Plasma membrane profiling and flow

86

cytometry show that pUL56-mediated degradation of GOPC reduces the cell-surface

87

abundance of multiple host proteins, including the immune signaling molecule Toll-like

88

receptor 2 (TLR2). This highlights an unanticipated and highly-efficient mechanism

89

whereby HSV-1 specifically targets a cellular trafficking factor in order to manipulate the

90

abundance of multiple proteins on the surface of infected cells.

Results

92

Quantitative Temporal Viromic study of HSV-1 infection

93

To construct an unbiased global picture of changes in host and viral proteins

94

throughout the course of HSV-1 infection, we infected human keratinocyte cells (HaCaT)

95

with HSV-1 at a high multiplicity of infection (10 PFU/cell) (Figure 1, Table S1).

96

Immunofluorescence analysis of parallel samples confirmed that >95% of cells were

97

infected. Ten-plex TMT and MS3 mass spectrometry were used to quantify changes in

98

protein expression over seven time points (Figure 1A). A particular advantage of such

99

TMT-based quantitation is the measurement of each protein at every time point. This

100

generated the most complete proteomic dataset examining the lytic replication cycle of

101

HSV-1 to date, quantifying 6956 human proteins and 67/74 canonical HSV-1 proteins,

102

and provided a global view of changes in protein expression during infection.

103

Temporal analysis of viral protein expression over the whole course of infection

104

can provide a complementary system of protein classification, in addition to enabling

105

direct correlation between viral and cellular protein profiles to give insights into viral-host

106

protein interaction (Soday et al., 2019; Weekes et al., 2014). The number of classes of

107

viral protein expression was determined by clustering viral proteins using the k-means

108

method. This identified at least five distinct temporal protein profiles of viral protein

109

expression (Figure S1, Table S1). Furthermore, by searching data against a 6-frame

110

translation of the HSV-1 strain used (KOS), eight putative new HSV-1 proteins (6FT-

111

ORFs) that increased in abundance over the course of infection were identified (Figure

112

S2A; Table S1).

124

HSV-1 infection led to >2-fold downregulation of 496 human proteins and >2-fold

125

upregulation of 34 proteins. Mock and immediate early (2h) infection samples clustered

126

separately from early (4, 6h) and late (9, 12, 18h) infection time points. Changes of the

127

greatest magnitude primarily occurred late during infection, as might be expected for a

128

virus with a potent host shutoff activity (Figure 1B). This effect can be observed by a

129

general shift to the left in a scatterplot of fold change (Figure 1C). Multiple host targets

130

known to be specifically downregulated during HSV-1 infection were confirmed, including

131

DNA PKcs (PRKDC) (Lees-Miller et al., 1996; Parkinson et al., 1999), Interferon Gamma

132

Inducible Protein 16 (IFI16) (Orzalli et al., 2012), Promyelocytic Leukemia (PML) (Chelbi-

133

134

135

Type Zinc Finger 3 (MORC3) (Sloan et al., 2015) (Figure 1D, Figure 2D and Table S1).

136

Proteomic data was validated by comparison to immunoblot analysis of cells infected for

137

16 h with three independent strains of HSV-1 and with HSV-2, which suggested that many

138

of the changes observed were conserved phenotypes (Figure 1E). All data are shown in

139

Table S1, in which the ‘‘Plotter” worksheet facilitates interactive generation of temporal

140

graphs of expression of each of the human or viral proteins quantified.

Bioinformatic enrichment analysis of HSV-1 infection

143

DAVID software (Huang da et al., 2009) was used to identify pathways significantly

144

enriched among proteins downregulated >2-fold (Figure 2A). Several of these pathways

145

are known to influence HSV-1 infection, for example cell cycle associated proteins such

146

as cyclin dependent kinases (Schang et al., 1998) and a range of DNA damage response

147

pathways [reviewed in (Smith and Weller, 2015)]. The ubiquitin-like (Ubl) conjugation

148

pathway was significantly enriched, consistent with the known targeting of certain

149

pathway components by herpesviruses to direct cellular prey for degradation. For

150

example, three SUMO family members were downregulated during infection (the fourth

151

was not quantified) (Figure 2B). Components of each enriched cluster are shown in Table

152

S2. A similar analysis of host proteins upregulated >2-fold did not reveal any enriched

clusters.

Identification of host targets most rapidly depleted following HSV-1 infection

166

Based on the premise that host proteins downregulated early during viral infection

167

are likely to be enriched in factors with antiviral activity, we analyzed proteins

168

downregulated >4-fold at the earliest timepoint after HSV-1 infection (2 hours post

169

infection (hpi); Figure 1C-D). Of the six proteins thus identified, four have previously been

170

shown to be reduced significantly in HSV-1 infected cells (Methyl-CpG Binding Domain

171

Protein 1 (MBD1), MORC3, TRIM27 and Zinc Finger Protein 462 (ZNF462)), of which

172

three were shown to be modulated in an ICP0-dependent manner (MBD1, MORC3, and

173

TRIM27) (Conwell et al., 2015; Sloan et al., 2015). The other two proteins (Senataxin

174

(SETX) and GOPC) have not been previously identified as targets of HSV-1 mediated

175

degradation.

176
177

pUL56 binds NEDD4 family of ubiquitin ligases and GOPC

178

ITCH, a member of the NEDD4 family of ubiquitin ligases, was rapidly depleted

179

during HSV-1 infection (Figure 1B-D). pUL56 proteins from HSV-1 and HSV-2 interact

180

with ITCH and NEDD4, leading to proteasomal degradation of these targets (Ushijima et

181

al., 2008; Ushijima et al., 2010). pUL56 is a tail-anchored type-II membrane protein found

182

in purified virions (Koshizuka et al., 2002) and contains three PPXY motifs that interact

183

with NEDD4, likely by binding to WW domains (Ushijima et al., 2008). Notably, pUL56

184

does not contain any lysine residues and is thus likely to be refractory to ubiquitination.

185

To further characterize the cellular binding partners of pUL56, stable isotope labelling of

186

amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) immunoprecipitation–mass spectrometry (IP-MS)

187

analysis was performed using cells expressing GFP-tagged pUL56 or GFP alone (Figures

188

3A and S3, Table S3). Several members of the NEDD4 family of ubiquitin ligases were

189

enriched in the pUL56 IP, as were multiple Trafficking Protein Particle Complex II

190

(TRAPPCII) subunits. Strikingly, GOPC was also identified as a binding partner of pUL56.

191

Co-precipitation assays demonstrated that the purified GST-tagged pUL56 cytoplasmic

192

domain (residues 1-207) is capable of binding purified GOPC, confirming that these two

193

proteins interact directly (Figure 3B). The N-terminal coiled-coil domain of GOPC

194

mediates its recruitment to the Golgi via an interaction with Golgin-160 (Hicks and

195

Machamer, 2005), whereas the PDZ domain mediates interactions with C-terminal PDZ-

196

binding motifs of cellular partner proteins (Yao et al., 2001). Truncation of GOPC showed

197

that residues 27-236, comprising the N-terminal coiled-coil region, are sufficient to bind

198

to pUL56 (Figure 3C). Immunoprecipitation experiments conducted with cells expressing

199

truncated forms of pUL56 demonstrated that residues 1-157 of pUL56 can mediate

200

efficient binding to GOPC whereas residues 1-104 do not, suggesting that a binding site

201

for GOPC may reside within the 53 amino acid sequence between pUL56 residues 105-

202

157 (Figure 3C). Taken together, these results suggest a model whereby pUL56 binds

203

both GOPC and NEDD4-family of ubiquitin ligases, bringing them in close proximity and

204

thus stimulating the ubiquitination and proteolytic degradation of GOPC.

Figure 3: pUL56 binds GOPC and cellular ubiquitin ligases
A. SILAC-labelled HEK293T cells were transfected with GFP-tagged pUL56 cytoplasmic domain (residues
1-207) or GFP alone and subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) using a GFP affinity resin. In the volcano
plot, the horizontal-axis shows average fold enrichment in IP of pUL56(1-207)-GFP compared to GFP
across three biological replicates and the vertical axis shows significance (two sided t-test) across the three
replicates. Significantly enriched proteins (>2-fold enrichment and p < 0.05) are colored blue and selected
proteins are annotated. B. Pull-down experiment using purified recombinant components, demonstrating
that the GST-tagged pUL56 cytoplasmic domain interacts directly with the coiled-coil region of GOPC. The
peptide-binding N-terminal domain of clathrin heavy chain (Clathrin NTD) and GST were used as control
prey and bait proteins, respectively. C. Co-IP of GOPC with GFP-tagged pUL56 and truncations thereof.
Immunoblots were stained with the antibodies shown. D. Schematic representation of pUL56 and GOPC.

218

pUL56 mediates degradation of GOPC via the proteasome

219

To identify the mechanism of GOPC degradation, cells were infected with wild-type

220

(WT) HSV-1 or HSV-1 lacking expression of pUL56 (∆UL56). Viruses lacking expression

221

of the viral proteins ICP0 (∆ICP0) or vhs (∆vhs) were also included, as both are known to

222

deplete host proteins. Cells were further treated with or without the proteasomal inhibitor

223

MG132. GOPC was degraded during HSV-1 infection in a pUL56-dependent and MG132-

224

inhibitable fashion, whereas GOPC degradation was independent of both ICP0 and vhs

225

(Figure 4A-B). Expression of pUL56 by transfection or in an inducible cell line

226

demonstrated that this protein is sufficient for GOPC degradation in the absence of other

227

HSV-1 factors (Figures 4C-D). HSV-1 pUL56 contains three PPXY motifs, which mediate

228

interaction with NEDD4 family of E3 ubiquitin ligases (Ushijima et al., 2010). To test the

229

importance of these PPXY motifs in pUL56 for GOPC degradation a recombinant virus

230

was generated in which all three motifs were mutated to AAXA. This triple mutant

231

phenocopied the deletion virus, failing to degrade GOPC even though pUL56 expression

232

was maintained (Figure 4E). Overall, these data suggest that pUL56 recruits NEDD4

233

family ubiquitin ligases to mediate the proteasomal degradation of GOPC.

Figure 4: pUL56 is necessary and sufficient for GOPC degradation
A. HaCaT cells were infected at MOI of 10 with the indicated virus. After 2 h, media was replaced with 10
μM MG132 or carrier (DMSO) in DMEM for the remainder of the infection. Cell lysates were harvested 16
hpi. B. HFF hTERT cells were infected at MOI of 1 then treated with MG132 or carrier as described in (A).
At 6 hpi, samples were fixed and stained for GOPC (green) and the infection control gD (red). The merge
includes DAPI (blue) and the scale bar represents 10 μm. C. HFF cells were transfected with pUL56-GFP.
One day post-transfection cells were fixed and stained for GOPC (red). The merge includes DAPI (blue)
and the scale bar represents 10 μm. D. Expression of pUL56 was induced with doxycycline in a clonal 293
FlpIn cell line. Cell lysates were harvested 1 day after induction. E. HaCaT cells were infected at MOI of 10
with the indicated virus and cell lysates were harvested 16 hpi.

245

Replication of HSV-1 in cell culture is independent of pUL56

246

The rapid depletion of GOPC from cells during HSV-1 infection implies that

247

removal of this host protein may be important for efficient viral replication. However, HSV-

248

1 ∆UL56, where endogenous levels of GOPC are maintained, demonstrated effectively

249

identical growth kinetics to HSV-1 WT (Figure 5A). Plaque size analysis also

250

demonstrated no defects in cell-to-cell spread for HSV-1 ∆UL56 compared to WT (Figure

251

5B-C). These data demonstrate that pUL56 is dispensable for HSV replication in cell

252

culture, consistent with previous reports (Ushijima et al., 2008). Given that viruses do not

253

usually retain genes of no benefit, this suggests that pUL56 plays a role during viral

254

replication in vivo, perhaps during establishment, maintenance, or reactivation from

255

latency. Alternatively, pUL56 may be a virulence factor involved in modulating antiviral

256

immune responses against HSV-1, as is the case for a number of herpesvirus proteins

257

that are dispensable in cell culture but important for replication in vivo, for example vhs

258

(Strelow and Leib, 1995).

Identification of host proteins specifically depleted by pUL56

270

ICP0 and vhs are known to cause extensive remodelling of host protein expression

271

to facilitate viral replication (Boutell and Everett, 2013; Smiley, 2004). Our data now

272

suggest that pUL56 also contributes to host protein depletion but in a more targeted

273

manner. To identify cellular proteins depleted by pUL56, HaCaT cells were infected with

274

HSV-1 WT or ΔUL56 and analyzed by TMT-based proteomics (Figure 5D, Table S4). Of

275

the 7696 human proteins quantified, only a small number exhibited significant abundance

276

changes between the WT and ∆UL56 infections, and the largest change observed was

277

for GOPC (Figure 5E-F). A small number of other potential targets of pUL56 were

278

identified, defined by >2-fold reduced abundance in HSV-1 WT samples compared to

279

mock and ∆UL56 samples. These included Discs Large MAGUK Scaffold Protein 3

280

(DLG3), Leucine Rich Repeat Containing 1 (LRRC1), and Erbb2 Interacting Protein

281

(ERBIN), which may function as a complex: both LRRC1 (aka LANO) and ERBIN have

282

been shown to interact with DLG proteins (Saito et al., 2001). The discs-large (DLG)

283

family have a number of proposed functions including regulation of cell polarity and tight

284

junction formation, and they are targeted for degradation by a number of viral families

285

(Kong et al., 2014; Lee et al., 1997; Roberts et al., 2012). Remodelling cell polarity through

286

pUL56-mediated degradation of these host proteins may facilitate HSV-1 spread in vivo.

287

Searching this TMT dataset against a 6-frame translation of KOS-strain HSV-1

288

identified 14 novel HSV-1 proteins that increased in abundance over the course of

289

infection, including 9 that were not identified in the initial QTV experiment (Figure S2B,

290

Table S4).

292

pUL56-activity alters the plasma membrane proteome

293

Modulation of proteins at the cell surface is an immune evasion strategy utilized by

294

multiple viruses. Since GOPC regulates the trafficking of certain proteins to the plasma

295

membrane (Cheng et al., 2002), destruction of GOPC through the activity of pUL56 may

296

be a mechanism to specifically modify the surface presentation of proteins in HSV-1

297

infected cells. Plasma membrane profiling was thus performed on cells infected with HSV-

298

1 WT or ΔUL56 at 6 hpi using SILAC-based mass spectrometry (Figure 6, Table S5).

299

Hierarchal clustering of the resulting data identified host proteins that are less abundant

300

at the plasma membrane of HSV-1 WT infected cells and rescued by pUL56 deletion.

301

These included immune signalling proteins TLR2 and IL18R1 as well as DUOX1 and

302

several members of the solute carrier (SLC) family of proteins. TLR2 is a pattern

303

recognition receptor that has a well-established activity against bacterial pathogen-

304

associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), but also recognizes HSV-1 and HCMV

305

glycoproteins (Boehme et al., 2006; Cai et al., 2013; Leoni et al., 2012). In response to

306

herpesvirus infection, TLR2 plays a role in inducing interferon γ in neurons, cytokines in

307

peritoneal macrophages, as well as controlling viral load in the CNS (Lima et al., 2010;

308

Sorensen et al., 2008). IL18 is a proinflammatory cytokine that binds IL18R1, which is

309

important for innate immune responses to HSV-2 infection in vivo (Harandi et al., 2001).

310

Downregulating these immune receptors from the cell surface may be a pro-viral strategy

311

to decrease inflammation and immune activation. DUOX1 (dual oxidase 1) is a

312

transmembrane protein that can generate H2O2 and functions in lactoperoxidase-

313

mediated antimicrobial defence at mucosal surfaces (Sarr et al., 2018). Production of

314

H2O2 has been shown to inhibit the splicing of influenza A virus (IAV) transcripts and

315

decrease production of infectious virus, and IAV has been shown to downregulate

316

DUOX1 (Strengert et al., 2014). Removing DUOX1 from the plasma membrane may be

317

similarly proviral for HSV-1 by inhibiting H2O2 production. The mechanism by which HSV-

318

1 depletes DUOX1 from the plasma membrane may be through pUL56-dependent

319

degradation of DUOXA1 (Figure 5F) as DUOXA1 is a chaperone required for the

320

maturation and transport of DUOX1 from the ER to the plasma membrane (Grasberger

321

and Refetoff, 2006).

333

TLR2 signalling is prevented by pUL56

334

To determine if loss of TLR2 from the cell surface was due to disruption of GOPC

335

mediated trafficking, we generated GOPC knockout HaCaT cells using CRISPR/Cas9

336

gene engineering. Three independent single-cell clones generated from two independent

337

sgRNAs targeting GOPC were stained for surface TLR2 and analyzed by flow cytometry.

338

Normal HaCaT cells included a TLR2+ population, whereas all three GOPC knockout

339

clones exhibited reduced cell surface TLR2 (Figure 7A-B), suggesting TLR2 surface

340

expression is GOPC-dependent.

341

Human monocytes respond to HSV-1 infection via TLR2 (Ahmad et al., 2008). To

342

assess the biological effect of TLR2 downregulation during infection, receptor activity was

343

measured in the THP1 human monocytic cell line. Cells were infected with HSV-1 WT or

344

ΔUL56 and then stimulated with the TLR2 agonist PAM3CSK4. The expression levels of

345

TNFα mRNA, which is stimulated by TLR2 signalling, were analyzed by RT-PCR.

346

PAM3CSK4 treatment of mock infected cells stimulated TNFα expression as expected,

347

and infection with HSV-1 WT supressed TNFα levels to below unstimulated controls. Cells

348

infected with HSV-1 ∆UL56 showed greater levels of TNFα expression relative to HSV-1

349

WT, although the levels were still suppressed compared to mock infected cells stimulated

350

with PAM3CSK4 (Figure 7C). This suggests that the functional consequences of pUL56-

351

stimulated degradation of GOPC includes inhibition of TLR2 signalling.

quantitative temporal viromics (Figures 1, 2 and 5), affinity enrichment (Figure 3) and

366

plasma-membrane proteomics (Figure 6), to identify that HSV-1 protein pUL56 promotes

367

degradation of the host-cell trafficking factor GOPC and in doing so lowers the abundance

368

of important immune signalling molecules at the plasma membrane of infected cells.

369

Biochemistry and cell biology experiments (Figures 3, 4, 5 and 7) confirmed that pUL56

370

binds directly to GOPC, is both necessary and sufficient to promote GOPC degradation,

371

requires the recruitment of the NEDD4 family of ubiquitin ligases via its PPXY motifs for

372

such degradation, and results in changes in the cell-surface proteome through the loss of

373

GOPC. The proteomic datasets presented in this manuscript represent a rich resource

374

for identifying and characterizing the mechanisms by which herpesviruses modulate both

375

the whole-cell and plasma-membrane proteomes of infected cells.

377

Temporal insights into HSV-1 infection

378

The QTV data presented herein represent the most comprehensive analysis of

379

host-cell proteome changes upon HSV-1 infection to date, with almost 7000 host proteins

380

quantified, and provide important insights into the kinetics of HSV-1 viral protein

381

production. K-means analysis identified five distinct profiles of protein expression (Figure

382

S1). Immediate early and early genes were found in the same class (Tp2). This

383

presumably arises from the high multiplicity of infection, required for synchronous and

384

complete infection, and the use of 2 hpi as the earliest time point. These conditions may

385

have masked some of the differences in the kinetic profiles of immediate early and early

386

gene classes. Interestingly, late genes appeared to cluster into three distinct groups (Tp3-

387

5). While late genes have previously been divided into late and true late classes,

388

dependent on the requirement for prior genome replication (Kibler et al., 1991), our data

389

suggests that an intermediate kinetic class may exist. Alternatively, this data may highlight

390

that viral proteins can mature at different rates despite their expression being induced at

391

the same time.

392

This kinetic analysis of HSV-1 protein abundance identified that ICP47 (US12) has

393

a unique temporal profile (Tp1, Figure S1). Unlike all other viral proteins, where the

394

abundance increases throughout infection, the amount of ICP47 peaks early during

395

infection and the protein is subsequently downregulated. ICP47 binds and inhibits the

396

MHC class I peptide loading complex Transporter of Antigenic Peptides (TAP), preventing

397

peptide presentation at the cell surface and promoting immune evasion (Hill et al., 1995).

398

The varying abundance of ICP47 during infection might therefore have the effect of

399

balancing evasion of CD8+ T-cells whilst preventing activation of NK cell killing, by

400

precisely regulating the level of MHC-I reduction at the cell surface.

401
402

HSV-1 pUL56 degrades GOPC by recruiting cellular E3 ligases

403

HSV-1 strains lacking pUL56 are attenuated in animal models (Berkowitz et al.,

404

1994; Kulej et al., 2017; Rosen-Wolff et al., 1991), despite the protein being dispensable

405

for virus replication in cultured cells (Figure 5A-C) (Ushijima et al., 2008). Our data provide

406

a molecular mechanism by which pUL56 may enhance virulence during infection, by

407

promoting the degradation of GOPC and subsequent down-regulation of immune

408

signalling molecules from the surface of infected cells.

409

Previous studies from HSV-1 and HSV-2 have shown pUL56 interact with ITCH

410

and NEDD4, leading to their degradation, but the importance of this activity remained

411

elusive (Ushijima et al., 2008; Ushijima et al., 2010). Our IP-MS data revealed that pUL56

412

binds multiple cellular NEDD4-family ubiquitin ligases and the trafficking factor GOPC

413

(Figure 3A). We show that pUL56 binds directly to the coiled-coil region of GOPC (Figure

414

3B), is necessary for the proteasome-mediated degradation of GOPC in HSV-1 infected

415

cells (Figure 4A-B), and is sufficient to promote GOPC degradation in the absence of

416

infection (Figure 4C-D). Furthermore, we show that the NEDD4-binding PPXY motifs of

417

pUL56 are required for GOPC degradation (Figure 4E). Taken together, these data

418

strongly support a model whereby pUL56 binds simultaneously to GOPC and the NEDD4

419

family of ubiquitin ligases in order to promote GOPC ubiquitination and proteasomal

420

degradation (Figure 7D). pUL56 is itself protected from degradation as it does not contain

421

lysine residues to which ubiquitin could be conjugated.

422

GOPC is rapidly degraded during HSV-1 WT infection (Figure 2D) and its

423

abundance is restored during infection with HSV-1 ΔUL56 (Figure 5E). Several other

424

proteins are also rescued when comparing HSV-1 WT to ΔUL56 infection. This may

425

reflect direct pUL56-mediated degradation or be an indirect consequence caused by the

426

loss of GOPC.

427
428

HSV-1 degrades a trafficking factor to modify the surface of infected cells

429

Many viruses modify the surface of infected cells in order to modulate the host

430

immune response. For example, HIV-1 Vpu recruits an E3 ligase to promote the

431

ubiquitination and the degradation of several cell-surface proteins (Matheson et al., 2015).

432

Alternatively, it has been shown that multiple proteins from human cytomegalovirus act

433

via distinct mechanisms to restrict the cell-surface presentation of class I MHC and NK

434

cell receptors (Wilkinson et al., 2008). Using global unbiased approaches, we have now

435

identified that HSV-1 pUL56 modifies the surface abundance of cellular immune signalling

436

proteins by specifically degrading a key cellular trafficking factor. This factor, GOPC, may

437

be a common target for modulation by viruses: human papillomavirus type 16 E6 protein

438

was shown to bind GOPC and mediate its degradation through the host E3 ubiquitin ligase

439

E6AP (Jeong et al., 2007). Unlike pUL56, E6 binds to the PDZ domain of GOPC through

440

a PDZ-binding motif. In addition, the classical swine fever virus NS2 protein bound GOPC

441

in a yeast two-hybrid screen (Kang et al., 2012), although it has not yet been determined

442

if GOPC is degraded during infection with this virus.

443

The pUL56 homologues from equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1) and type 4 (EHV-

444

4) share only 20% identity with HSV-1 pUL56, yet both are type II transmembrane proteins

445

that possess multiple PPXY motifs and have few or no cytoplasmic lysine residues.

446

Interestingly, both EHV-1 and EHV-4 have been shown to downregulate MHC-1 from the

447

surface of infected cells in a pUL56-dependent fashion (Ma et al., 2012; Said et al., 2012).

448

Similarly, U24 from human herpesvirus 6A (HHV-6A) is a tail-anchored (type-II)

449

membrane protein containing a PPXY motif and has been shown to downregulate the T-

450

cell receptor (Koshizuka et al., 2018; Sullivan and Coscoy, 2008). It therefore seems likely

451

that EHV pUL56 and HHV-6A U24 also recruit NEDD4-family ubiquitin ligases to degrade

452

specific cellular proteins and thus modify cell-surface protein abundance, but the direct

453

targets of these proteins remain unknown.

454

In conclusion, our data have identified that HSV-1 pUL56 targets GOPC for

455

proteasomal degradation, thereby removing immune signalling molecules from the

456

plasma membrane. This represents an elegant and efficient mechanism by which HSV-1

457

can remodel the surface of infected cells. The degradation of GOPC by other viruses such

458

as human papillomavirus suggests that targeting of GOPC specifically, or trafficking

459

factors more generally, may represent a common mechanism by which viruses modulate

460

the host-cell surface to evade host immune surveillance.

Viruses

806

All HSV-1 strain KOS viruses were reconstituted from a bacterial artificial

chromosome (Gierasch et al., 2006). The deletion mutants were generated by inserting

808

three tandem stop codons in frame using the two-step Red recombination method

809

(Tischer et al., 2010). For ΔUL56 this is after residue 21, for ΔICP0 this is after residue

810

11, and for Δvhs this is after residue 45 (Zenner et al., 2013). HSV-1 S17 and HSV-2 333

811

were from S. Efstathiou (University of Cambridge), and HSV-1 SC16 was from A. Minson

812

(University of Cambridge). Crude stocks were generated by infecting Vero cells at MOI of

841

An antibody against pUL56 was generated by commercial immunization of a rabbit

842

using two peptides (peptide 1: NH2-CTSSGEGEASERGRSR-NH2; peptide 2: Ac-

843

AARGSSDHAPYRRQGC-NH2) coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Eurogentec). An

844

affinity purification column was generated by adding 0.96 mg of purified peptide 1

845

dissolved in coupling buffer (250 mM Tris pH 8.5, 25 mM EDTA) to 0.4 mL of SulfoLink

846

resin (ThermoFisher) equilibrated in the same buffer. The resin was incubated with the

847

peptide for two hours at 20°C with regular mixing, washed with 1.2 mL of coupling buffer

848

and then blocked using 50 mM cysteine in coupling buffer at 20°C for 90 minutes with

849

regular mixing. The resin was subsequently washed twice with 1 mL of 1 M NaCl, followed

850

by another two washes with 5 mL of PBS. The immune serum was mixed with an equal

851

volume of PBS and incubated with the peptide-coupled resin for 20 h at 4°C. The affinity-

852

purified antibody was eluted in fractions using 100 mM glycine pH 2.5 into tubes

853

containing 10× neutralization buffer (1M Tris pH 8.5, 2 M NaCl). Specificity of the antibody

854

for use in immunoblots was tested by probing against cell lysates where pUL56 was

855

absent or overexpressed, against lysates of cells infected with HSV-1 WT or ΔUL56, and

856

against the GST-tagged purified recombinant protein (see below). BSA was added to the

857

antibody for stabilization (final concentration 1 mg/mL) and the antibody was stored as a

858

50% (v/v) glycerol stock at -20°C.

Infection

861

Cell monolayers were infected with HSV-1 at the specified MOI diluted in complete

862

media. For experiments to be analyzed by mass spectrometry, gradient-purified virus

863

stocks were used. Otherwise, the infection was performed with crude virus stocks

864

generated as described above. After adsorption for 1 h at 37°C with 5% CO2 and rocking

865

every 15 min, the appropriate media was added to the well and this was designated 0 hpi.

866

Infected cells were incubated at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere until harvest.

Whole cell lysate preparation and protein digestion for quantitative temporal viromics

869

HaCaT cells were seeded into 6-well plates and infected in parallel at the specified

870

MOI with gradient purified virus. At each indicated time point, cells were washed twice

871

with PBS, and 250 µL lysis buffer was added (6M guanidine, 50 mM HEPES pH 8.5). Cell

872

lifters (Corning) were used to scrape cells in lysis buffer, which was removed to an

873

microcentrifuge tube, vortexed extensively, and then sonicated, and snap frozen in liquid

874

nitrogen. After harvest, samples were stored at -70°C until all time points were harvested.

875

Samples were thawed and cell debris was removed by centrifuging at 21,000×g for 10

876

min twice. Dithiothreitol (DTT) was added to a final concentration of 5 mM and samples

877

were incubated for 20 min. Cysteines were alkylated with 14 mM iodoacetamide and

878

incubated 20 min at room temperature in the dark. Excess iodoacetamide was quenched

879

with DTT for 15 mins. Samples were diluted with 200 mM HEPES pH 8.5 to 1.5 M

880

guanidine, followed by digestion at room temperature for 3 h with LysC protease (Wako)

881

at a 1:100 protease-to-protein ratio. Samples were further diluted with 200 mM HEPES

882

pH 8.5 to 0.5 M guanidine. Trypsin (Pierce) was then added at a 1:100 protease-to-protein

ratio followed by overnight incubation at 37°C. The reaction was quenched with 5% (v/v)

884

888

Peptide labelling with tandem mass tags for whole cell experiments

889

In preparation for TMT labelling, desalted peptides were dissolved in 200 mM

890

HEPES pH 8.5. Peptide concentration was measured by microBCA (Pierce), and >25 µg

891

of peptide were labelled with TMT reagent. TMT reagents (0.8 mg) were dissolved in 43

892

μL anhydrous acetonitrile (MeCN) and 5 μL was added to the peptides at a final MeCN

893

concentration of 30% (v/v). Sample labelling was as indicated in Table S1 and S4.

894

Following incubation at room temperature for 1 h, the reaction was quenched with

895

hydroxylamine to a final concentration of 0.5%. TMT-labelled samples were combined at

896

a 1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1 ratio. The sample was vacuum-centrifuged to near dryness and

897

subjected to C18 SPE (Sep-Pak, Waters). An unfractionated sample was analyzed

898

initially to ensure similar peptide loading across each TMT channel, to avoid the need for

899

excessive (>2-fold) electronic normalization. Samples were combined according to the

900

correction factors from the unfractionated analysis and subjected to C18 SPE (Sep-Pak,

901

Waters) and vacuum-centrifuged to near-dryness. The dried pellet was resuspended in

902

200 mM ammonium formate pH 10 and subjected to high pH reversed-phase (HpRP)

903

fractionation is as described below.

Offline HpRP fractionation for whole cell lysate experiments

906

TMT-labelled tryptic peptides were subjected to HpRP fractionation using an

907

Ultimate 3000 RSLC UHPLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with a 2.1 mm

908

internal diameter (ID) x 25 cm long, 1.7 µm particle Kinetix Evo C18 column

909

(Phenomenex). Mobile phase consisted of A: 3% (v/v) MeCN, B: MeCN and C: 200 mM

910

ammonium formate pH 10. Isocratic conditions were 90% A / 10% C, and C was

911

maintained at 10% throughout the gradient elution. Separations were conducted at 45°C.

912

Samples were loaded at 200 µL/min for 5 min. The flow rate was then increased to 400

913

µL/min over 5 min, after which the gradient elution proceed as follows: 0-19% B over 10

914

min, 19-34% B over 14.25 min, 34-50% B over 8.75 min, followed by a 10 min wash at

915

90% B. UV absorbance was monitored at 280 nm and 15 s fractions were collected into

916

96-well microplates using the integrated fraction collector. Fractions were recombined

917

orthogonally in a checkerboard fashion, combining alternate wells from each column of

918

the plate into a single fraction, and commencing combination of adjacent fractions in

919

alternating rows. Wells prior to the start or after the stop of elution of peptide-rich fractions,

920

as identified from the UV trace, were excluded. This yielded two sets of 12 combined

921

fractions, A and B, which were dried in a vacuum centrifuge and resuspended in 10 µL

922

MS solvent (4% (v/v) MeCN / 5% (v/v) FA) prior to LC-MS3. For the time course

923

experiment (Figure 1A) and ΔUL56/wildtype HSV-1 whole cell lysate experiment (Figure

924

5D), 12 set ‘A’ fractions were used for MS analysis.

Offline Tip-Based Strong Cation Exchange SCX Fractionation

927

Our previously described protocol for solid-phase extraction-based SCX peptide

928

fractionation was modified for small peptide amounts (Dephoure and Gygi, 2011). Briefly,

929

10 mg of PolySulfethyl A bulk material (Nest Group Inc.) was loaded on to a fritted 200

930

µL tip in 100% Methanol using a vacuum manifold. SCX material was conditioned slowly

931

with 1 mL SCX buffer A (7M KH2PO4, pH 2.65, 30% (v/v) MeCN), then 0.5 mL SCX buffer

932

B (7 mM KH2PO4, pH 2.65, 350 mM KCl, 30% (v/v) MeCN) then 2 mL SCX buffer A. Dried

933

peptides were resuspended in 500 mL SCX buffer A and added to the tip at a flow rate of

934

~150 mL/min, followed by a 150 mL wash with SCX buffer A. Fractions were eluted in

935

150 µL buffer at increasing K+ concentrations (10, 25, 40, 60, 90, 150 mM KCl), vacuum-

936

centrifuged to near dryness, then desalted using StageTips and vacuum-centrifuged to

937

complete dryness and resuspended in 10 µL MS solvent (4% (v/v) MeCN / 5% (v/v) FA)

938

prior to LC-MS3.

LC-MS/MS/MS for whole cell lysate experiments

941

Mass spectrometry data was acquired using an Orbitrap Lumos (Thermo Fisher

942

943

ID x 5 mm Acclaim PepMap µ-Precolumn (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and a 75 µm ID x 50

944

cm 2.1 µm particle Acclaim PepMap RSLC analytical column was used. Loading solvent

945

was 0.1% FA, analytical solvent A: 0.1% FA and B: 80% (v/v) MeCN + 0.1% FA. All

946

separations were carried out at 55°C. Samples were loaded at 5 µL/min for 5 min in

947

loading solvent before beginning the analytical gradient. The following gradient was used:

948

equilibration at 3% B for 15 min. Each analysis used a MultiNotch MS3-based TMT

950

method (McAlister et al., 2012; McAlister et al., 2014). The following settings were used:

951

MS1: 380-1500 Th, 120,000 Resolution, 2×105 automatic gain control (AGC) target, 50

952

ms maximum injection time. MS2: Quadrupole isolation at an isolation width of m/z 0.7,

953

CID fragmentation (normalized collision energy (NCE) 35) with ion trap scanning in turbo

954

mode from m/z 120, 1.5×104 AGC target, 120 ms maximum injection time. MS3: In

955

Synchronous Precursor Selection mode the top 6 MS2 ions were selected for HCD

956

fragmentation (NCE 65) and scanned in the Orbitrap at 60,000 resolution with an AGC

957

target of 1×105 and a maximum accumulation time of 150 ms. Ions were not accumulated

958

for all parallelizable time. The entire MS/MS/MS cycle had a target time of 3 s. Dynamic

959

exclusion was set to +/- 10 ppm for 70 s. MS2 fragmentation was trigged on precursors

960

5×103 counts and above.

TMT Data analysis

963

In the following description, we list the first report in the literature for each relevant

964

algorithm. Mass spectra were processed using a Sequest-based software pipeline for

965

quantitative proteomics, “MassPike”, through a collaborative arrangement with Professor

966

Steve Gygi’s laboratory at Harvard Medical School. MS spectra were converted to mzxml

967

using an extractor built upon Thermo Fisher’s RAW File Reader library (version 4.0.26).

968

In this extractor, the standard mzxml format has been augmented with additional custom

969

fields that are specific to ion trap and Orbitrap mass spectrometry and essential for TMT

970

quantitation. These additional fields include ion injection times for each scan, Fourier

971

Transform-derived baseline and noise values calculated for every Orbitrap scan, isolation

widths for each scan type, scan event numbers, and elapsed scan times. This software

973

is a component of the MassPike software platform and is licensed by Harvard Medical

975

A combined database was constructed from (a) the human UniProt database (26th

976

January, 2017), (b) HSV-1 strain KOS (Genbank entry JQ673480.1, manually updated

977

with a single amino acid polymorphism in the ICP4 sequence identified in the KOS BAC

978

strain used for virus generation), (c) common contaminants such as porcine trypsin and

979

endoproteinase LysC. The combined database was concatenated with a reverse

980

database composed of all protein sequences in reversed order. Searches were performed

981

using a 20 ppm precursor ion tolerance (Haas et al., 2006). Product ion tolerance was set

982

to 0.03 Th. TMT tags on lysine residues and peptide N termini (229.162932 Da) and

983

carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues (57.02146 Da) were set as static

984

modifications, while oxidation of methionine residues (15.99492 Da) was set as a variable

985

modification.

986

To control the fraction of erroneous protein identifications, a target-decoy strategy

987

was employed (Elias and Gygi, 2010). Peptide spectral matches (PSMs) were filtered to

988

an initial peptide-level false discovery rate (FDR) of 1% with subsequent filtering to attain

989

a final protein-level FDR of 1% (Kim et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2011). PSM filtering was

990

performed using a linear discriminant analysis (Huttlin et al., 2010). This distinguishes

991

correct from incorrect peptide IDs in a manner analogous to the widely used Percolator

992

algorithm (Kall et al., 2007), though employing a distinct machine learning algorithm. The

993

following parameters were considered: XCorr, ΔCn, missed cleavages, peptide length,

994

charge state, and precursor mass accuracy. Protein assembly was guided by principles

995

of parsimony to produce the smallest set of proteins necessary to account for all observed

996

peptides (Huttlin et al., 2010). Where all PSMs from a given HSV-1 protein could be

997

explained either by a canonical gene or non-canonical ORF, the canonical gene was

998

picked in preference.

999

In three cases, PSMs assigned to a non-canonical ORFs or novel 6FT-ORFs were

1000

a mixture of peptides from the canonical protein and the ORF. This most commonly

1001

occurred where the ORF was a 5’-terminal extension of the canonical protein (thus

1002

meaning that the smallest set of proteins necessary to account for all observed peptides

1003

included the ORFs alone). In these cases, the peptides corresponding to the canonical

1004

protein were separated from those unique to the ORF, generating two separate entries.

1005

Proteins were quantified by summing TMT reporter ion counts across all matching

1006

peptide-spectral matches using ”MassPike”, as described (McAlister et al., 2012;

1007

McAlister et al., 2014). Briefly, a 0.003 Th window around the theoretical m/z of each

1008

reporter ion (126, 127n, 127c, 128n, 128c, 129n, 129c, 130n, 130c, 131n, 131c) was

1009

scanned for ions, and the maximum intensity nearest to the theoretical m/z was used.

1010

The primary determinant of quantitation quality is the number of TMT reporter ions

1011

detected in each MS3 spectrum, which is directly proportional to the signal-to-noise (S:N)

1012

ratio observed for each ion (Makarov and Denisov, 2009). Conservatively, every

1013

individual peptide used for quantitation was required to contribute sufficient TMT reporter

1014

ions (minimum of ~1250 per spectrum) so that each on its own could be expected to

1015

provide a representative picture of relative protein abundance (McAlister et al., 2012).

1016

Additionally, an isolation specificity filter was employed to minimize peptide co-isolation

1017

(Ting et al., 2011). Peptide-spectral matches with poor quality MS3 spectra (more than 9

1018

TMT channels missing and/or a combined S:N ratio of less than 250 across all TMT

1019

reporter ions) or no MS3 spectra at all were excluded from quantitation. Peptides meeting

1020

the stated criteria for reliable quantitation were then summed by parent protein, in effect

1021

weighting the contributions of individual peptides to the total protein signal based on their

1022

individual TMT reporter ion yields. Protein quantitation values were exported for further

1023

analysis in Excel (Microsoft).

1024

For protein quantitation, reverse and contaminant proteins were removed, then

1025

each reporter ion channel was summed across all quantified proteins and normalized

1026

assuming equal protein loading across all channels. For further analysis and display in

1027

figures, fractional TMT signals were used (i.e. reporting the fraction of maximal signal

1028

observed for each protein in each TMT channel, rather than the absolute normalized

1029

signal intensity). This effectively corrected for differences in the numbers of peptides

1030

observed per protein. For TMT experiments, normalized S:N values are presented in

1031

Table S1 and S4 (‘Data’ worksheet).

1032

Significance B was used to estimate the probability that each ratio was significantly

1033

different to 1 (Cox and Mann, 2008). Values were calculated and corrected for multiple

1034

hypothesis testing using the method of Benjamini-Hochberg in Perseus version 1.5.1.6

1035

(Cox and Mann, 2008). A corrected p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Mass spectrometry of SILAC IP samples

1088

Mass spectrometry analysis was performed by the proteomics facility of the

1089

University of Bristol (UK). Three biological repeats of each triple-labelled SILAC IP

1090

experiment were analyzed. Samples were run into precast SDS-PAGE gels for 5 minutes,

1091

the entire sample extracted from the gel as a single band, and then in-gel digested,

1092

reduced and alkylated using a ProGest automated digestion unit (Digilab). The resulting

1093

peptides were fractionated using an Ultimate 3000 nano-LC system in line with an

1094

Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). In brief, peptides in 1%

1095

(v/v) FA were injected onto an Acclaim PepMap C18 nano-trap column (Thermo

1096

Scientific). After washing with 0.5% MeCN in 0.1% FA, peptides were resolved on a 250

1097

mm × 75 μm Acclaim PepMap C18 reverse phase analytical column (Thermo Scientific)

1098

over a 150 min organic gradient using 7 gradient segments (1-6% solvent B over 1 min,

1099

6-15% B over 58 min, 15-32% B over 58 min, 32-40% B over 5 min, 40-90% B over 1

1100

min, held at 90% B for 6 min and then reduced to 1% B over 1min) with a flow rate of 300

1101

nL per minute. Solvent A was 0.1% FA and solvent B was aqueous 80% MeCN in 0.1%

1102

FA. Peptides were ionized by nano-electrospray ionization at 2.0 kV using a stainless

1103

steel emitter with an internal diameter of 30 µm (Thermo Scientific) and a capillary

1104

temperature of 275°C. All spectra were acquired using an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass

1105

spectrometer controlled by Xcalibur 2.1 software (Thermo Scientific) and operated in

1106

data-dependent acquisition mode. FTMS1 spectra were collected at a resolution of

1108

of 300,000 and a max injection time of 100 ms. Precursors were filtered using an Intensity

1109

Range of 1×104 to 1×1020 and according to charge state (to include charge states 2-6)

1110

and with monoisotopic precursor selection. Previously interrogated precursors were

1111

excluded using a dynamic window (40 s +/-10 ppm). The MS2 precursors were isolated

1112

with a quadrupole mass filter set to a width of 1.4 m/z. ITMS2 spectra were collected with

1113

an AGC target of 20,000, max injection time of 40 ms and CID collision energy of 35%.

1114

The raw data files were processed using MaxQuant v. 1.5.7.4 (Cox and Mann,

1115

2008). The in-built Andromeda search engine (Cox et al., 2011) was used to search

1116

against the human and HSV-1 strain KOS proteomes as used for TMT analysis (above).

1117

Trypsin/P digestion, standard modifications (oxidation, N-terminal acetylation) were

1118

selected as group-specific parameters and SILAC quantification was performed using

1119

light (Arg0, Lys0), medium (Arg6, Lys4) and heavy (Arg10, Lys8) labels. Re-

1120

quantification, razor protein FDR, and second peptide options were enabled for the

1121

processing. The quantified data were analyzed with Perseus v. 1.6.1.2 (Tyanova et al.,

1122

2016) using the normalized ratios obtained by MaxQuant. Proteins only identified by site

1123

or against the reverse database, as well as common experimental contaminants such as

1124

keratins (specified in the MaxQuant contaminants file), were removed and the

1125

experiments grouped by biological repeat. Only proteins identified in at least two of the

1126

three biological repeats were considered for analysis. A one-sample, two-sided t-test with

1127

a threshold p-value of 0.05 was performed on each group to identify significantly enriched

1128

proteins. Proteins with a log2 fold change greater than 1 and a p value smaller than 0.05

1129

were designated as potential interactors of pUL56.

Recombinant protein expression and purification

1132

For bacterial recombinant expression, the cytoplasmic region (residues 1-207) of

1133

UL56 from HSV-1 strain KOS was cloned into a vector derived from pOPT (Teo et al.,

1134

2004) encoding Schistosoma japonicum GST followed by a human rhinovirus 3C

1135

cleavage sequence fused to the N terminus and LysHis6 fused to the C terminus (GST-

1136

UL56(1-207)-His). Full-length (residues 1-454) and truncated forms (residues 1-362, 27-

1137

362, 27-275, 276-362 and 27-236) of GOPC (UniProt ID Q9HD26-2) were cloned from

1138

HeLa cell cDNA into a vector derived from pOPT (Teo et al., 2004) encoding a MetAlaHis6

1139

tag fused to the N terminus of each construct (His-GOPC).

1140

His-GOPC (both full-length and truncations) was expressed in Escherichia coli

1141

BL21(DE3)pLysS cells (Novagen) and GST-UL56(1–207)-His was expressed in E. coli

1142

T7 Express LysY/Iq cells (New England Biolabs). Cells were cultured in 2×TY medium to

1143

an OD600 between 0.8 and 1.0. For His-GOPC, the culture was cooled to 22°C before

1144

adding 0.2 mM IPTG and culturing for a further 16 h. For GST-UL56(1–207)-His, 1 mM

1145

IPTG was added and the cells were cultured for a further 2 h. Cells were harvested by

1146

centrifugation and pellets stored at -80°C.

1147

For His-GOPC, cell pellets were resuspended on ice in Ni2+ wash buffer (20 mM

Bait proteins were diluted to 5 µM in pull-down buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 200 mM

1181

NaCl, 0.1% NP-40, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA) and, for each experiment, 200 µL of bait

1182

mixture was incubated for 15-30 min at room temperature with 10 µL of glutathione

1183

magnetic beads (Pierce) that had been pre-equilibrated in pull-down buffer. Supernatant

1184

Virus growth curves, and plaque assays

1222

Growth curves were performed using HaCaT cells infected in complete media with

1223

crude virus stocks of HSV-1 WT or HSV-1 ΔUL56 at MOI of 10. After adsorption for 1 h

1224

at 37°C, cells were incubated with acid wash (40 mM citric acid, 135 mM NaCl, 10 mM

1225

KCl; pH 3.0) for 1 min and washed 3x with PBS before cell culture media was added back.

1226

The time of acid wash was deemed 0 hpi. At various times post-infection, cells were

1227

harvested by freezing the plate at -70°C. After freezing the last time point, samples were

1228

freeze-thawed together 2 subsequent times and scraped before they were titred.

1229

Titrations were performed on Vero monolayers. Cells were inoculated with serial dilutions

1230

of the samples for 1 h, after which DMEM containing 0.3% high viscosity carboxymethyl

1231

cellulose, 0.3% low viscosity carboxymethyl cellulose, 2% (v/v) FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine,

1232

100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin was overlaid. After 3 days, cells were

1233

fixed in 3.75% (v/v) formaldehyde in PBS for 30 min and stained with 0.1% toluidine blue.

1234

For plaque size measurements, HaCaT, HFF hTERT, or Vero cells were grown in

1235

6-well plates. The cells were infected and fixed as described above, but they were stained

1236

with an anti-gD antibody (LP2). Plaques were visualized with a secondary antibody

media at MOI 10. Plasma membrane profiling was performed as described previously

1245

with minor modifications (Weekes et al., 2010). Briefly, at 6 hpi cells were washed, surface

1246

sialic acid residues oxidized with sodium-meta-periodate and labelled with aminooxy-

1247

biotin. The reaction was quenched and the biotinylated cells scraped into 1% (v/v) Triton

1248

X-100 lysis buffer. Biotinylated glycoproteins were enriched with high affinity streptavidin

1249

agarose beads and washed extensively. Captured protein was denatured with DTT,

1250

alkylated with iodoacetamide (IAA) and digested on-bead with trypsin in 100 mM HEPES

1251

pH 8.5 for 3 h. Tryptic peptides were collected and fractionated by tip-based SCX strong
