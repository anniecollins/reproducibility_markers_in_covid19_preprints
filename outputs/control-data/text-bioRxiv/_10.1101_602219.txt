Abstract

16

Strains of Pseudomonas, Bacillus and Azospirillum with plant growth promoting ability were

17

checked for their zinc solubilizing ability. Efficient zinc solubilizers were checked for their ability

18

to produce nano-scale zinc particles. The nanoparticles from the cell-free culture filtrates obtained

19

from these strains were characterized for particle size, Zeta potential and functional groups.

20

Presence of Zn nanoparticles in the bacterial culture filtrate was confirmed by particle distribution

21

and Scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis. Most properties of nanoparticles are size

22

dependent. Zinc nanoparticles were observed to be spherical in shape and size ranged from 52.0

23

to 106.0 nm. Zeta potential of the Zn nanoparticles was estimated to understand the stability of

24

the particles. The measured zeta potentials varied from -14.5mV to +179.10 mV indicating high

25

stability and dispersion of the zinc nanoparticles. FTIR peaks at different wave numbers depicted

26

the role of functional groups of proteins in the biosynthesis of Zn nanoparticles. This finding

27

opens a new area of research focusing on microbe-microbe interactions in rhizosphere and plant-

28

microbe interactions at rhizosphere apart from biosynthesis of nanoparticles, which has major

1. Introduction

39

Food- and nutritional-security are major concerns of most of the developing nations. Production

40

of sufficient and nutritious food is a major challenge in front of many countries including India.

41

Zinc (Zn) is one of the vital minerals required for optimum plant growth as well as animals,

42

including human beings such as mental retardations, impairments of the immune system and

43

overall poor health. In recent years, the Zn deficiency problem has received increasing attention

44

and appears to be the most serious micronutrient deficiency together with vitamin A deficiency.

45

Zinc deficiency is particularly widespread among children and represents a major cause of child

46

death world over. It plays a vital role in biochemical reactions in plants and its deficiency is

47

displayed as a remarkable reduction in plant height and develops whitish-brown patches that turn

48

necrotic subsequently (Hughes and Poole;1989). Zn occurs in soil as sphalerite, olivine,

49

hornblende, augite and biotite and availability of Zn from these sources is guided by many factors

50

among which bio-chemical actions of rhizo microorganisms play an important role (Bhupinder

51

Singh 2005). The solubility of zinc is highly dependent upon soil pH and moisture and this is the

52

reason why arid and semi-arid areas are zinc deficient. Most of the Zn in soil is in unavailable

53

form and thus unable to meet nutritional requirements of plants. In India, >50% of agro-

54

ecosystems are Zn deficient, especially the Indo-Gangetic plains spanning across the States of

55

Punjab and Uttar Pradesh. Overall, zinc deficiency in the country has increased from 42% to 49%

56

in the past four decades and it is expected to increase up to 63% by 2025 (Singh 2009). Plant

57

response to Zn deficiency occurs in terms of membrane integrity loss, reduced synthesis of

58

metabolites and susceptibility to heat stress (Bhupinder Singh 2005). Zn is supplemented

59

exogenously to plants in the form of chemical fertilizers like zinc sulphate that subsequently

60

transforms (96-99%) into different insoluble forms depending upon the soil types, physico-

61

chemical reactions and thus becomes totally unavailable in the environment within seven days of

62

application (Rattan and Shukla 1991; Venkatakrishnan 2003).

63

External supplementation of micronutrients is not only expensive, but also leads to unwanted

64

accumulation of them in the soil in fixed forms. Accumulation of excess Zn complex leads to

65

deterioration of soil-health, integrity and microbial diversity. Further, at a given point of time,

66

plants need only small quantities of micronutrients. Efforts to supplement nutrients in the form of

67

biofertilizers helped the rainfed farmers significantly (Venkateswarlu and Wani 1999). Strains of

68

species of Pseudomonas, Bacillus, Azotobacter, Azospirillum and Acetobacter etc. are known to

69

promote plant growth, (Kloepper 1991 and Orhan 2006). Solubilization of mineral nutrients;

70

stimulation of root growth; and suppression of root diseases are some of the modes of actions of

71

plant growth promoting rhizobacteria in influencing plant health and productivity (Martinez-

72

Viveros 2010). Bacteria-mediated solubilization of phosphorus (P) to supplement P requirement

73

of the plants is a popular technology among farmers in many countries (Cattelan 1999; Gull et al.,

74

2004; Richardson et al 2009; Leo Daniel Amalraj et al., 2014). Similarly, Zn solubilization by

75

microorganisms has been widely studied in fungi and bacteria (White et al., 1997; Di Simine et

76

al., 1998; Fasim et al., 2002; Suseelendra Desai et al., 2012). Nanoparticles with small size and

77

large surface area are expected to be the ideal candidates for use as a Zn fertilizer in plants

78

(Prasad 2012). Particle size may affect the agronomic effectiveness of Zn fertilizers. Decreased

79

particle size results in increased number of particles per unit weight of applied Zn. Decreased

80

particle size also increases the specific surface area of a fertilizer, which should increase the

81

dissolution rate of fertilizers with low solubility in water, such as zinc oxide (ZnO) (Mortvedt,

82

1992). Nanoparticles of Mg, Zn, Fe and P are the structural component of enzymes (phosphatases

83

and phytase), polysaccharides and chlorophyll. In plants, nanoparticles can be applied for a broad

84

range of uses, particularly to tackle Phytopathological infections, nutrition supplement and as

85

growth adjuvant. These nanoparticles can be tagged to agrochemicals or other substances as

86

delivery agent to plant system and tissues for controlled release of chemicals. They are known to

87

stabilize the enzyme complexes in plants. First evidence of biosynthesis of nanoparticles was

88

reported using Pseudomonas stulzeri where the nanoparticles were deposited on the cell

89

membrane (Klaus 1999). Subsequently, Bacillus licheniformis (Kalimuthu 2008); Lactobacillus

90

strains (Nair 2002); Bacillus subtilis (Saifuddin 2009); Cornybacterium sp. (Zhang 2005); and

91

E.coli (Gurunathan 2009a; Gurunathan 2009b) were shown to be involved in extra and

92

intracellular synthesis of nanoparticles. (Minaeian 2008) reported synthesis of silver 50-100 nm

93

particles by Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli. While a number of reports are available

94

on the biological synthesis of silver nanoparticles by potential endophytic microorganisms, scanty

95

information is reported on the synthesis of Zn nanoparticles using plant growth promoting

96

bacteria. In the present study, we report the ability of Zn solubilising rhizobacteria isolated from

97

various crop production systems of different agro-ecological sub regions of India to produce Zn

98

nanoparticles.

99

2. Materials and methods

100

Bacterial strains used in this study were obtained from the culture bank of ICAR-Central

101

Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture, Hyderabad. Based on previous qualitative and

102

quantitative screening, five efficient zinc solubilising strains viz. Bacillus B116, Pseudomonas

103

P29, Pseudomonas P33, and Azospirillum 20 were selected for nanoparticle analysis (Praveen

104

Kumar 2012).

105

All the isolates were grown in Minimal salt medium amended with 0.1% ZnO with an initial

106

population containing 2x108 CFU/ml and incubated at room temperature in an orbital shaking

107

incubator with 180 rpm speed. The culture medium was centrifuged after 72h of inoculation and

108

the supernatant was collected. Supernatant was analysed for the presence of nanoparticles in

109

nanoparticle analyzer.

110

2.1 Characterization of Zn nanoparticles

111

Ten mL of the supernatant was transferred to a cuvette and placed into the nanoparticle analyzer

112

(Horiba Nanoparticula 100). Three replicas for each sample were maintained respectively. Each

113

sample was read three times and the mean was considered as particle size. The zeta potentials

114

were recorded using Particle size analyzer (Horiba Nanoparticula 100, Japan). This apparatus uses

115

Dynamic Light scattering (DLS) phenomenon. The sample holder temperature was maintained at

116

250C, a technique used to determine the stability profile of small particles in solution. Nano scale

117

Zinc particles were observed under SEM. To observe nanoparticles of Zinc, 10 μl of the

118

suspension was spotted on to the metal slide. Metal slide was placed inside a desiccator over night

119

to remove moisture completely. After removing the slide from the desiccator, a gold sputtering of

120

approximately 1nm was done over the suspension.

121

For Fourier Transform Infra Red (FTIR) spectroscopy measurement, the bio-transformed product

122

present in cell-free filtrate was analyzed. FTIR spectrum (Bruker Tensor 27, USA) was recorded

123

in mid IR region in the range of 400–4000 wavenumber cm-1. A drop of the sample solution was

124

carefully added to the potassium bromide crystals using a micropipette and the spectrum was

125

recorded in transmittance (%) mode.

3.1 Zeta Potential

154

Using the nano particle analyzer, the Zeta potential was measured as the magnitude of

155

ZetaPotential (-200mV to +200mV) gives an indication of the potential stability of the colloidal

156

system. The Zeta potentials of Zn nanoparticles produced by B116, P33, P29 and Asp20 were

157

+179.1 mV, -14.5mV, + 0.5mV and 0.5 mV respectively, clearly indicating the stability of the

158

nanoparticles (Fig 2).

nanoparticles (Fig 3). The FTIR spectra of cell-free extracts of ZnO amended MS medium

167

showed prominent peaks at 3346, 2923, 1636, 1459 and 538 wave numbers cm-1. The strong

168

broad wave at 3346 cm-1 is attributed to NH stretch of amides. The wave observed at 2923 cm-1 is

169

stretch vibration of primary and secondary amides of protein. The band observed at 1636 cm-1 is

170

assigned to the bending vibrational mode of amides. The peaks at 1459 refer to amino and amino-

171

methyl stretching groups of protein. Peak observed at 529cm-1 corresponds to the stretching

172

vibrations of Zn nanoparticles.

4. Discussion

178

Plant growth promoting strains of Pseudomonas, Bacillus and Azospirillum found to solubilize

179

ZnO and ZnCO3 were formulated and field-evaluated. While trying to understand their mode of

180

action of Zn solubilization, we found that these strains synthesized Zn nanoparticles in vitro when

181

cultured in MS broth supplemented with ZnO or ZnCO3. There were differences among the

182

strains in synthesizing different sizes of zinc nanoparticles. According to particle size distribution

183

and SEM analysis, Pseudomonas putida P29 produced smallest zinc nanoparticles of the size 52

184

nm followed by Asp20 and B116 produced large particles (106 nm) as against control where the

185

particle size was 5200 nm. The exact mechanism for the synthesis of nanoparticles using

186

biological agents has not yet been elucidated but it has been suggested that various biomolecules

187

are responsible for the synthesis of nanoparticles. The mechanism of extracellular biosynthesis of

188

nanoparticles is proposed as a reductase-mediated reaction, which brings about bioreduction of

189

metal ions and synthesizes nanoparticles (Honary et al., 2012). In the present study, FTIR

190

spectrum of the nanoparticles indicated the presence of various chemical groups, one of which is

191

an amide. An amide I band was observed at 1636 wavecm-1, which is the bending vibrational

192

mode of amides. The stretching band of amide at 3346 wavecm-1 further confirmed this result.

193

The 1636 wave cm-1 corresponds to amide I due to carbonyl stretch in proteins. FTIR spectrum

194

showed the presence of functional groups such as amide linkages and –COO–, possibly between

195

amino acid residues in protein and the synthesized Zn nanoparticles. This report is in line with the

196

findings of (Honary 2012) which support the interactions between the proteins and nanoparticles

197

during the biosynthesis. The surface properties of the nanoparticles are known to be one of the

198

most important factors that govern their stability and mobility as colloidal suspensions, or their

199

adsorption or aggregation and deposition. Zeta potential can be related to the stability of colloidal

200

dispersions (Vielkind 2013) as it indicates the degree of repulsion between adjacent and similarly

201

charged particles in dispersion and high zeta potential values indicate high stability and with

202

decrease in the particle size, the stability also decreases. Highest zeta potential of +179.10 mV

203

was observed for the particle size 106.0 nm produced by B116 indicating best stability. However,

204

nanoparticles with zeta potential values greater than +25mV and -25mV typically are stable

205

(Sonika 2015). Hence, it could be inferred that the nanoparticles produced with lower zeta

206

potentials such as +0.5mV may not be stable even though they are only 52 nm. Further, low

207

stability nanoparticles tend to form aggregates in the medium, which is influenced by various

208

factors. Aggregation of metal oxide nanoparticles in aqueous solutions depends on ionic strenght,

209

pH, surface charge and charge density (Guzman 2006; Domingos 2009). In the present study also,

210

such aggregation was noticed in cases where the zeta potential was low. Results of particle size

211

distribution clearly indicated that the obtained Zinc nanoparticles are mono as well as poly

212

dispersed in nature. Samples with very broad size distribution have Poly dispersity index values

213

>0.7. These findings are supported by the findings of (Anil reddy 2009).

214

5. Conclusion

215

Plant nutrient management is an important domain of research and needs understanding of the

216

basic phenomena of uptake and utilization of all essential nutrients. Zn is an essential nutrient

217

which has a major role in several plant- and human-metabolic pathways. The present finding

218

opens up a new area of research of not only green synthesis of nanoparticles using biological

219

systems but also the dynamics of inter-organism nutrient dependence in the rhizosphere. In this

220

study, we have reported for the first time synthesis of Zn nanoparticles by the plant growth

221

promoting bacteria with a particle size ranging from 52 to 106 nm. Further research is underway

222

to understand role of these Zn nanoparticles as a factor in rhizosphere dynamics and modulation,

223

its uptake and transport in crop systems for increasing the productivity.
