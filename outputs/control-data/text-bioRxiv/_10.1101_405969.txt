ABSTRACT
Principles of genome folding and their relationship to function depend on understanding
conformational changes of the chromatin fiber in real-time. However, bulk chromatin motion has not
been analysed at high resolution. We developed Hi-D, a method to quantitatively map dynamics of
chromatin and abundant nuclear proteins for every pixel simultaneously over the entire nucleus from
fluorescence image series. Hi-D combines reconstruction of chromatin motion using computer vision
and classification of local diffusion processes by Bayesian inference. We discovered that DNA
dynamics in the nuclear interior are spatially partitioned into 0.3 – 3 µm domains in a mosaic-like
manner which is uncoupled from chromatin compaction. This pattern was remodeled in response to
transcriptional activity accompanied by global reduction of DNA dynamics. In contrast, we found that
RNA polymerase II dynamics are, compared to actively transcribing cells, reduced in quiescent cells
and when elongation was inhibited. Our results strengthen the hypothesis that chromatin dynamics
are dictated by interchromatin contacts, rather than chromatin density. Hi-D can be applied to any
dense and bulk structures opening new perspectives towards understanding motion of nuclear
molecules in the context of nuclear architecture.

INTRODUCTION
Spatial organization and dynamics of chromatin correlate with cell function and fate [1]. In mammalian
cells, chromosomes occupy territories whose localization is stable over the cell cycle [2]. Each
chromosome contains dense heterochromatin and open euchromatin areas whose extent is indicative
of cellular activity [3]. Transitions within and between eu- and heterochromatin involve multiple levels
of chromatin organization from nucleosome density, long-range looping and domain folding that
adapt to and enable DNA processing [4]. Structural models derived from contact and crosslinking
frequencies [5–7] are consistent with the view that the genome is partitioned into compartments and
sub-compartments [8]. It is now becoming increasingly clear that such nuclear compartments are also
dynamic entities whose formation and maintenance over time is of great interest in order to
understand the mechanisms and function of genome folding [9]. Tracking of labelled single DNA loci
[10–14] or chromatin domains [15,16] demonstrated that chromatin motion is highly heterogeneous
at short time intervals. However, sparse loci are difficult to place in the context of global chromatin
organization and its enduring configurational changes [17]. On the other hand, locally restricted
genomic processes can also not be inferred from quantities averaged over the entire nucleus [18,19].
A first study analyzing bulk chromatin motion at nanoscale resolution revealed dynamic partitioning
of chromatin into a number of nuclear sub-regions which show correlated motion of chromatin in the
micrometer range [20]. However, to further elucidate underlying physical mechanisms driving
chromatin dynamics and giving rise to their spatial coherence, an integrated characterization of the
stochastic motion of nuclear molecules in their native, and physiological environment at the local scale
is needed. Likewise, whether compaction of chromatin determines its spatial coherence or whether
chromatin dynamics are distinct in open and closed chromatin is still a matter of debate.
To decipher the relationship between genome compaction, activity and functional dynamics, we
developed Hi-D, a method to overcome the limitations of sparse and ensemble approaches for
imaging dense structures such as chromatin and nuclear proteins. Hi-D, a combination of dense optical

flow reconstruction to quantify the local motion of chromatin at sub-pixel accuracy from live cell
imaging, and a Bayesian inference approach to precisely classify local types of diffusion. Biophysical
properties such as diffusion constants and anomalous exponents were determined for each pixel to
create two dimensional maps of chromatin dynamics at single pixel resolution over the entire nucleus
in living single cells. We find that DNA compaction and dynamics do not necessarily correlate. Instead,
we strengthen the hypothesis that chromatin dynamics are dictated by interchromatin contacts and
confinement, rather than chromatin density.

RESULTS
Hi-D maps genome dynamic properties at nanoscale spatial resolution in living cells

Motion observed within a series of conventional confocal fluorescence microscopy images was
quantitatively reconstructed by a dense Optical Flow method [20] and trajectories were calculated by
integration of the resulting flow fields (Figure 1a, Supplementary Note 1). The type of diffusion
characterizing each pixel’s chromatin motion was determined in an unbiased manner using Bayesian
inference to simultaneously test a set of common models to fit each trajectory’s Mean Squared
Displacement (MSD) curve [21] (Figure 1b, left panel, Supplementary Figure 2). The five principal
models are shown as a coloured map directly on the nucleus (Figure 1b, right panel) (Methods
section). In general, we found that only a small fraction of trajectories displayed directed diffusion
(Figure 1b), while the bulk of chromatin exhibited sub-diffusive behaviour. Over the duration of the
experiment, distinguishing MSD between the comparable cases of anomalous and confined diffusion
is a challenging task. By examining a range of parameters governing different types of diffusion, our
results suggest that chromatin diffusion in human U2OS cells can be adequately described as
anomalous to avoid misinterpretation (Supplementary Note 2). Biophysical parameters calculated for
each pixel (diffusion constant 𝐷, anomalous exponent 𝛼 and drift velocity 𝑉) are presented in colorcoded 2D heat-maps (Figure 1c) (Methods section) and form islands of irregular shape and dimensions

(Figure 1c). These parameter maps clearly demonstrate that chromatin exhibits spatially
heterogeneous and partitioned dynamics forming a mosaic of domains with similar values
characterizing chromatin motion. This view is in line with current insights that chromatin dynamics are
spatially correlated in the micrometer-range [18,20]. To further explore and characterize this
heterogeneous distribution, parameter value distributions were deconvolved into contributing subpopulations using a General Mixture model (GMM) (Figure 1c, Methods, and Supplementary Figure
4). We identified three populations of chromatin mobility which we refer to as slow, intermediate and
fast (Methods, exemplary in Figure 1c), irrespective of the parameter under consideration (diffusion
constant or anomalous exponent) or transcription state of the cell. We found that directed motion
involving a drift velocity (V) was present to a much lower extent than free and anomalous diffusion
resulting in much less data for V than for the other two parameters (Figure 1c). Hence drift velocity
was not retained for further analysis.

Validation of the Hi-D approach in simulation and experiment

In order to examine the accuracy of calculated trajectories and associated diffusion constants by HiD, we compared Hi-D results to dynamic multiple-target tracing (MTT), a Single Particle Tracking (SPT)
method which is commonly used for dense molecule tracking [22] (Figure 2a,b; Supplementary Note
2; Supplementary Figure 7). While the SPT method outperforms the Hi-D approach in scenarios of
sparsely labelled molecules (Figure 2a), Hi-D calculations result in considerably more accurate
estimates for local diffusion constants than SPT estimates in scenarios of densely labelled molecules
or structures of heterogeneous labelling density such as chromatin (Figure 2b). Hi-D therefore
constitutes an approach to extract dynamic information of biomolecules with dense labeling where
SPT cannot. To ensure that the calculated dynamics are not a consequence of imaging noise, we
experimentally validated the sensitivity of the approach by calculating the MSD for formaldehyde fixed
and living U2OS cells labelled by DNA-SiR in quiescence (- serum) or normal growth (+ serum).
Diffusion constants derived from the MSD curves by Bayesian inference were about two orders of

magnitude greater in living cells than in fixed cells (Figure 2c) confirming that Hi-D enables quantifying
DNA dynamics well above the noise background. To confirm the robustness of extracted parameter
values with respect to varying levels of imaging noise, Hi-D was applied to imaged nuclei to which
noise was artificially added. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the original nuclei were about 26 dB and
the SNR was reduced to 16 dB. The computed distribution of diffusion constants is consistent up to a
lower limit of about 20 dB, below which the distribution is considerably biased towards larger values
and broadens (Figure 2d, Supplementary Figure 8). Likewise, features of the spatial map of diffusion
constants is equally conserved for SNR values as low as 20 dB, demonstrating the robustness of Hi-D
for varying imaging noise (Supplementary Figure 8). In analogy to the robustness to varying SNR levels,
Hi-D is thus robust to photobleaching effects (provided that SNR ≥ 20dB) since flow fields are only
estimated between consecutive images, between which illumination changes due to photobleaching
are usually negligible. Furthermore, Hi-D was also shown to be robust to slight variations in the time
intervals of acquired time series as long as the expected motion between frames was in the order of
the pixel size of the imaging system used (Supplementary Figure 9). We further validated Hi-D against
iMSD, a well-established method to extract dynamic information of dense molecules, based on the
spatial correlation function of intensity fluctuations caused by diffusing molecules, which are recorded
using camera-based systems [23]. Using successive applications of iMSD to overlapping regions of
interest, we computed a diffusion map similar to Hi-D derived maps (Supplementary Note 4).
Quantitatively, both methods yield diffusion constants in the same order of magnitude (Hi-D
(1.6 ± 0.8) ⋅ 10−3 𝜇𝑚2 /𝑠 , iMSD (2.2 ± 4.5) ⋅ 10−3 𝜇𝑚2 /𝑠, mean ± standard deviation), which are
consistent with reported values using single particle tracking and correlation spectroscopy methods
in interphase chromatin [14,18] .

However, the distribution of values derived by iMSD was

considerably broader then the distribution revealed by Hi-D (Figure 2f). The distribution of anomalous
exponents computed by iMSD showed many spurious values at the limit of the scale, while Hi-D
returns reasonable values (Figure 2g). We thus conclude that Hi-D reveals dynamic parameters of the
same order of magnitude as iMSD, a comparable method, but is advantageous in the estimation of

multiple parameters simultaneously, by virtue of the featured Bayesian model selection. Hi-D is thus
an accurate, robust, fast and easy to use readout of dynamics of nuclear macromolecules.

Single-cell biophysical property maps of genome conformation and behaviour

To concomitantly monitor position and distribution of the DNA mobility populations in different
biological conditions, we determined Hi-D maps for a single serum-starved and then stimulated cell
(Figure 3a). Cells grown in a serum-free medium arrest in G0 in which transcription is globally inhibited;
adding serum to the medium brings cells back into the cell cycle and stimulates transcriptional activity
[20,24,25]. Diffusion constants were calculated for each pixel based on the model selected by Bayesian
inference. Small diffusion constants were prominently located at the nuclear envelope (dark blue).
Plotting the average diffusion constants versus the distance from the nuclear periphery showed that
the mobility within a rim of 1 µm from the periphery increases linearly before assuming a nearly
constant value in the inner volume of the nucleus (Supplementary Figure 10). In numerous sites across
the remaining nuclear volume, fast diffusive areas of irregular dimensions spanning 0.3 − 3 𝜇𝑚 in
diameter (yellow areas in Figure 3a) are imbedded in the bulk of moderately dynamic chromatin. Areas
of different parameter values seamlessly transition into one another without clearly defined
boundaries, evident of spatially correlated chromatin dynamics [20]. Upon serum stimulation, the
spatial distribution of high and low diffusion constants was largely conserved (compare the presence
of yellow regions in the quiescent and serum stimulated cell in Figure 3a), but the diffusion constant
was globally strongly reduced about one order of magnitude. Deconvolution of the distribution of
diffusion constants and labelling of the pixels according to their population (Figure 3b; slow - red,
intermediate – orange and fast - yellow) confirms this observation. Deconvolution constitutes a
relative classification of regions with higher/lower or average values of a given parameter compared
to other regions within the same nucleus and permits visualization of the redistribution of populations
upon varying nuclear activity. In particular, the population diffusing quickly with respect to the bulk
chromatin in quiescent cells is reduced upon serum stimulation (Figure 3c), while most pixels adjoining

the other populations are re-classified as intermediate populations. Connected areas with high
mobility appear eroded and become reduced to their central region (Figure 3b). In contrast, the slow
population occupying ~ 6 % of the nuclear area, which was almost exclusively located at the nuclear
periphery (Supplementary Figure 10), was invariant to transcriptional changes (Figure 3b,c). Despite
considerable relative reorganization of populations, the type of diffusion governing the derived
parameter maps showed only moderate changes upon inducing transcriptional activity (Figure 3d).
Anomalous diffusion dominated across the entire nucleus (0.3 ≤ 𝛼 ≤ 0.73) forming a mosaic-like
pattern, which underwent, compared to maps of the diffusion constant, considerable remodeling
upon transcriptional activation (Figure 3e, f). Within this pattern, patches of super-diffusive (red: 𝛼 >
1) motion segregated into distinct islands which became more fragmented upon serum stimulation.
Random contacts or re-distribution of existing contacts of the interchromatin with itself may give rise
such variations of the anomalous exponent upon serum stimulation [26]. Since, in a polymer modeling
approach, the diffusion constant of chromatin fibers was unaffected for moderate degrees of crosslinking [27], we expect that association of proteins with DNA upon serum stimulation could favor
global decrease of mobility in vivo.

Hi-D reveals high-resolution spatial changes in mobility and anomaly of chromatin diffusion in single
cells. Further investigation may tell us if all or a subset of visible physical domains correspond to the
ones determined using chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C).

Transcription status modulates chromatin diffusion processes

To further explore the relationship between global chromatin dynamics and transcriptional activity,
we examined the dynamics of RNA polymerase II (RPB1-Dendra2; RNA Pol II) in live U2OS cell nuclei
(Figure 4a) at different transcriptional states. Hi-D analysis resolved three mobility populations of RNA
Pol II (Figure 4b), which is consistent with previous studies that revealed three kinetically different

groups of RNA Pol II based on their chromatin-binding times [28,29]. The three dynamic populations
in actively transcribing cells (grown in normal condition) exhibited significantly higher diffusion
constants as in transcriptionally less active cells (serum-starved cells) (Figure 4b). In quiescent cells,
the share of quickly diffusing RNA Pol II complexes was reduced compared to actively transcribing cells
and, upon elongation inhibition using 5,6-Dichloro-1-β-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB), the
slowly diffusing fraction was greater than in untreated cells, indicating tenacious immobilization of
RNA Pol II on the DNA template after initiation (Figure 4c). The average diffusion constants in serum
starved and DRB treated cells are similar for the three populations, suggesting that RNA Pol II not
phosphorylated in absence of serum coherent with published data identifying serum starved cells in
the first place [25]. We then compared the effect of transcriptional activity on chromatin dynamics in
serum-starved and –stimulated cells. In contrast to RNA Pol II mobility, the average diffusion constant
of DNA in serum-starved U2OS nuclei decreased by nearly one order of magnitude, for all three
populations upon addition of serum, and arresting RNA Pol II before elongation did not change the
observed diffusion constants, compared to undisturbed transcription (Figure 4d). These cellpopulation results are consistent with results from single-cell analyses (Figure 3) and strengthen our
hypothesis that processes involved in cellular functions considerably reduce the diffusion of
chromatin. While in a quiescent state, only a fraction of nuclear processes is active, allowing chromatin
to be more mobile. Upon activation, binding of transcription complexes and other proteins acting on
the DNA cause the observed reduction in chromatin dynamics. In agreement with this hypothesis,
previously enhanced spatial correlation of chromatin dynamics in serum-stimulated cells is also likely
accompanied by manifestation of DNA-protein interactions and possibly increased interchromatin
contacts, compared to quiescent cells [20].
In serum-stimulated cells, sub-diffusive and super-diffusive regimes were intensified (Figure 4e). The
presence of a population with 𝛼 close to 0.5 in both conditions is indicative of a ground-state Rouselike chromatin fiber architecture [30,31]. Upon serum stimulation, anomalous diffusion became
predominant and its value (𝛼 ~ 0.33) is indicative of entangled polymers [32], and was seen for a

single labelled site [13]. The entanglement could effectively be established by random DNAcrosslinking by protein complexes, as became also apparent from polymer simulations inspired by
chromosomal capture data [33]. Serum induction also activates the transcription by increase of
RNAPII-Ser5P levels that leads to binding of the RNA Pol II complex to DNA, whose motion is therefore
greatly constrained to the local DNA’s motion. Elongation inhibition however, does likely not change
local concentrations of RNA Pol II along the DNA, which also became apparent from chromatin
coherence data [20].

Chromatin dynamics is uncoupled from compaction

We next asked if chromatin dynamics is influenced by the compaction of chromatin since
heterochromatin is widely believed to be less dynamic than euchromatin [16]. Eu- and
heterochromatin domains were determined in serum-starved and –stimulated cells by the
fluorescence intensity as explained in [34] (Figure 5a). The average flow magnitude between all
subsequent frames was independent of the compaction state of chromatin (Figure 5b) and likewise,
the diffusion constant as a measure of the time averaged magnitude of dynamics did not show any
difference between euchromatin and heterochromatin (Figure 5c). Heterochromatin at the nuclear
periphery overlapped with the peripheral slow motion domain (Figure 5d) consistent with previous
findings [16]. Inside the nucleus however, we did not observe any tendency of heterochromatin being
associated with a specific mobility population. Instead, we observed that mobility populations were
distributed equally among euchromatin and heterochromatin regions (Figure 5e) with the exception
in serum-starved cells, that the part of heterochromatin was slightly greater in the slow diffusion
population at the nuclear periphery. Furthermore, we found that regions characterized by a specific
anomalous exponent did not show a tendency to overlap with either eu- or heterochromatin (Figure
5f, g). These results also hold for MCF7 cells and different fluorescent markers for chromatin
(Supplementary Figure 11). These findings were confirmed in NIH3T3 cells expressing both mCherry9

H2A and GFP-HP1α, two well-established markers for the eu- and heterochromatin (Supplementary
Figure 12). We could not detect reduced dynamics of either of the two types of chromatin, but instead,
Hi-D analysis hints towards previously proposed liquid phase-separation of HP1α [35]. These results
thus suggest that chromatin undergoes diffusion processes which are, in general, unrelated to the
compaction level of chromatin. However, compact chromatin is characterized by an increased contact
frequency of the chromatin fiber with itself which seems plausible to enhance the extent of coherent
chromatin motion. To test this hypothesis, we calculated Moran’s Index of Spatial Autocorrelation [36]
for the flow magnitude assessed at different time lags in either eu- or heterochromatin (Figure 5h).
We found that heterochromatin exhibits enhanced spatial autocorrelation compared to euchromatin
across all accessible time lags, which is in line with our hypothesis. Furthermore, spatial
autocorrelation decreases with increasing time lag in serum-starved cells, while in serum-stimulated
cells, autocorrelation is enhanced in the long-time limit (over 30 seconds). This points to active
processes establishing spatial coherence in the long-term [18,20] while random processes such as
thermal fluctuations decrease autocorrelation in the range of 10 seconds and over the whole time
span in serum-starved cells.

DISCUSSION
Hi-D is a single cell approach that enables tracking of dense structures such as chromatin directly
without losing active fluorophore density and with no need for prior experience in sophisticated
labelling preparations or advanced microscopy [37]. We showed that Hi-D is an accurate and robust
read-out of chromatin dynamics and that the information gain through image analysis afforded by HiD alleviates the incompatibility of conventional microscopy for nanoscale mapping of chromatin
dynamic properties in living cells.
Hi-D analysis revealed that DNA dynamics can roughly be classified into three sub-populations. The
use of three distinct populations does not reflect the real, likely fluent transitions between the

populations, but emerged as a handy means of visualization and characterization of the highly
complex and heterogeneous dynamic landscape of chromatin. The first, a slow mobility fraction
prominently located at the nuclear rim, is reminiscent of lamina associated domains (LADs) [38] and
the dynamic response to transcriptional stimuli supports the hypothesis that LADs play an important
role in attenuating transcription activity and of gene expression patterns [39]. Although less mobile
chromatin at the nuclear periphery largely overlapped with long known perinuclear heterochromatin
[40,41], Hi-D analysis remarkably points to an overall absence of correlation between chromatin
compaction and mobility. Instead, we could strengthen the hypothesis that heterochromatin domains
are formed by a liquid phase-separation mechanism, by detection of a characteristic mobility
reduction across phase boundaries.
Indeed, sub-regions displaying intermediate and highly diffusive regimes were distributed in a mosaiclike pattern throughout the nucleus, some of them also at the nuclear periphery. Heterochromatin
therefore does not exhibit low mobility in nuclear space in general, but may be
divided into a more viscous component with reduced mobility due to anchoring to a nuclear lamina
and a more rigid elastic LAD tethered to nuclear structures [38,42–44]. The extent of the third, highly
mobile fraction, which dominated in the quiescent state, decreased dramatically when cells were
serum stimulated. This switch in chromatin mobility is suggestive of dramatically altered molecular
crowding, as a result accrued concentration of players of all types in a highly transcribing nucleus, in
particular ribosome biogenesis [20,45–47].
Heterogeneous chromatin motion arises due to irregular protein binding along the chromosomes and
can lead to thermodynamic or electrostatic self-organisation of nuclear compartments [48,49]. Local
patches of large anomalous exponents indicate super-diffusive behaviour of chromatin which may
result, among others, from thermal and/or active noise acting on the chromatin fiber [50,51], even in
quiescent cells. Chromatin patches with 𝛼 < 0.3 and 𝛼 > 1 respectively correspond in size to one or
a few TADs [52]. These two types of patches are present as islands within the general chromatin
fraction governed by an anomalous exponent 0.3 < 𝛼 < 1. This organization is in good agreement

with the chromosome territory – interchromatin compartment model [2]. In conclusion, the
combination of diffusion constant and anomalous exponent maps provides an integrated view on
chromatin dynamics and yields insights into possible mechanisms driving dynamics as well as the local
chromosomal organization and re-organization during genomic processes.
Our results support the hypothesis that short treatment of DRB is sufficient to halt most of a cell’s
transcription[53], but it is believed to have a slight impact on the chromatin configuration of
promoters, as well as on upstream events and assembly dynamics of the preinitiation complex (PIC)
[54]. In particular, our results show that a few minutes of DRB treatment affects only the assembly
dynamics of the RNA Pol II itself. In contrast, longer treatment with DRB as well as longer serum
starvation, are expected to result in massive PIC disassembly. We believe therefore that increased
chromatin mobility upon serum starvation correlates with PIC breakdown. Conversely, when serum is
present in the medium, activity of RNA Pol II and of PIC enzymes is restored and PIC will assemble onto
DNA, both pervasively across the genome at background levels ("pervasive transcription") and more
stably at genes [55,56]. Reduced mobility of chromatin in the presence of serum suggests that stable
PIC binding may serve as an anchoring function for individual chromatin fibres, on top of its essential
function in transcription initiation.
Hi-D can be applied to real-time imaging of any fluorescent molecule to obtain comprehensive maps
of their dynamic behavior in response to stimuli, inhibitors or disruptors of nuclear functions and
integrity. Here, Hi-D is developed to track bulk objectives in two dimensions, however, it could be
extended to full three-dimensional analysis. It could also be combined with the tracking of specific loci
to zoom in on their environment.

METHODS
Cell Culture. A Human U2OS osterosarcoma cell line (for DNA imaging) and MCF-7 cells (ATCC) were
maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) containing phenol red-free and DMED-12
(Sigma-Aldrich), respectively. For RNA Pol II imaging, a U2OS cell line stably expressing RPB1 (subunit
of RNA Pol II) fused with Dendra2 was a gift from Maxime Dahan (Curie Institute, Paris) and
constructed as previously described in [46]. Medium was supplemented with Glutamax containing 50
μg/ml gentamicin (Sigma-Aldrich), 10% Fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (SigmaAldrich) and G418 0.5 mg/ml (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37°C with 5% CO2. Cells were plated for 24 h on 35
mm petri dishes with a #1.5 coverslip like bottom (μ-Dish, Ibidi, Biovalley) with a density of about 105
cells/dish.
Cell starvation and stimulation. For starvation mode, cells were incubated for 24 h at 37°C before
imaging with serum-free medium (DMEM, Glutamax containing 50 μg/ml gentamicin, 1 mM sodium
pyruvate, and G418 0.5 mg/ml). Just before imaging, cells were mounted in L-15 medium. For
stimulation, 10% FBS was added to the L-15 medium for 10-15 minutes.
DNA staining. U2OS and MCF-7 cell lines were labelled by using SiR-DNA (SiR-Hoechst) kit
(Spirochrome AG). For DNA was labelled as described in [57]. Briefly, we diluted 1 mM stock solution
in cell culture medium to concentration of 2 μM and vortexed briefly. On the day of the imaging, the
culture medium was changed to medium containing SiR-fluorophores and incubated at 37°C for 30-60
minutes. Before imaging, the medium was changed to L-15 medium (Liebovitz’s, Gibco) for live
imaging.
DRB treatment: The U2OS cells for both DNA and RNA Pol II images were treated with 100 μM 5,6
Dichlorobenzimidazole 1-β-D-ribofuranoside (DRB; Sigma-Aldrich) for transcription inhibition prior to
live-cell image acquisition. DRB was diluted in the L-15 (Leibovitz) imaging medium that was
supplemented with 10% FBS, DMEM, Glutamax containing 50 μg/ml gentamicin, 1 mM sodium

pyruvate, and G418 0.5 mg/ml. The imaging medium was changed with fresh L-15 medium containing
DRB and incubated under the microscope for 15 min before imaging.

Cell fixation: U2OS cells were washed with a pre-warmed (37 °C) phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and
followed by fixation with 4% (vol/vol) Paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10-20 min at room temperature.
Images were recorded at room temperature in PBS, after washing the cells with PBS (three times, 5
min each).
DNA live cell imaging: Cells were placed in a 37 °C humid incubator by controlling the temperature
and CO2 flow using H201-couple with temperature and CO2 units. Live chromatin imaging was acquired
using a DMI8 inverted automated microscope (Leica Microsystems) featuring a confocal spinning disk
unit (CSU-X1-M1N, Yokogawa). An integrated laser engine (ILE 400, Andor) was used for excitation
with a selected wavelength of 647 nm and 140 mW as excitation power. A 100x oil immersion
objective (Leica HCX-PL-APO) with a 1.4 NA was chosen for a high resolution imaging. Fluorescence
emission of the SiR–Hoechst was filtered by a single-band bandpass filter (FF01-650/13-25, Semrock,
Inc.). Image series of 150 frames (5 fps), with exposure time of 150ms per frame were acquired using
Metamorph software (Molecular Devices), and detected using sCMOS cameras (ORCA-Flash4.0 V2)
and (1×1 binning), with sample pixel size of 65 nm. All series were recorded at 37°C.
RNA Pol II live cell imaging: Image series of 150 frames were recorded with an exposure time of 200
ms using a Nipkow-disk confocal system (Revolution, Andor) featuring a confocal spinning disk unit
(CSU22, Yokogawa). A diode-pumped solid-state laser with a single wavelength of a 488 nm (Coherent)
at 5-10% laser power was used for excitation of RPB1 fused to Dendra2. A 100x an oil immersion
objective (Plan Apo 1.42, Nikon) was used for imaging. The fluorescent emission signal was filtered
through an emission filter (ET525/30-25, Semrock, Inc.), and detected at 512/18 nm on a cooled
electron multiplying charge-coupled device camera (iXon Ultra 888), with sample pixel size of 88 nm.

Image processing
Denoising. Raw images were denoised using non-iterative bilateral filtering [58]. While Gaussian
blurring only accounts for the spatial distance of a pixel and its neighbourhood, bilateral filtering
additionally takes the difference in intensity values into account and is therefore an edge-preserving
method. Abrupt transitions from high- to low-intensity regions (e.g. heterochromatin to
euchromatin) are not over-smoothed. Images of varying noise levels were treated with a bilateral
filter with half-size of the Gaussian bilateral filter window of 5 pixels, the spatial-domain standard
deviation value was set to 5 pixels and the intensity-domain standard deviation was varied from 0.3
to 0.8 for decreasing levels of the signal-to-noise ratio from 26 dB to 16 dB (𝑆𝑁𝑅 = 10 log10(𝐼 2 /𝜎 2 ),
with the signal power 𝐼 2 and the noise variance 𝜎 2 ).

MSD analysis and model selection by using Bayesian inference
In order to carry out a MSD analysis locally, the spatial dependency of the Mean Squared
Displacement (MSD) can be written explicitly:
2

MSD(r⃗0 , 𝜏) = 〈|𝜉⃗𝑟𝑜 (𝑡 + 𝜏) − 𝜉⃗𝑟0 (𝑡)| 〉𝑡 ,
where 𝜉⃗𝑟0 (𝑡) is the position at time 𝑡 of a virtual particle with initial position 𝑟⃗0 , 𝜏 =
{Δ𝑡, 2Δ𝑡, … , (𝑁 − 1)Δ𝑡} are time lags where Δ𝑡 is the time difference between subsequent images
and the average <⋅>𝑡 is taken over time. The resulting MSD is a function of the initial position 𝑟⃗0 and
the time lag 𝜏.
MSD models: The MSD can be expressed analytically for anomalous diffusion (DA), confined diffusion
(DR) and directed motion (V) in two dimensions as
𝑀𝑆𝐷𝐷𝐴 (𝜏) = 4𝐷𝛼 𝜏 𝛼
𝑀𝑆𝐷𝐷𝑅 (𝜏) = 𝑅𝐶2 (1 − e

where 𝐷𝛼 is the diffusion constant in units of 𝜇𝑚2 /𝑠 𝛼 , 𝛼 is its anomalous exponent, 𝑣 [𝜇𝑚/𝑠] its
velocity and 𝑅𝐶 [𝜇𝑚] is the radius of a sphere within the particle is confined [59]. The case 𝛼 = 1 is
known as free diffusion, 0 < 𝛼 < 1 corresponds to anomalous diffusion and 1 < 𝛼 ≤ 2 corresponds
to superdiffusion. Strictly speaking, each generalized diffusion constant 𝐷𝛼 has different units,
corresponding to the specific value of 𝛼. However, we refer to it as the diffusion constant 𝐷
throughout the text for simplicity. Additionally to eq. (1)-(3), different types of motion can appear
overlaying, resulting in a linear combination of the equations above. For example, anomalous motion
can be superimposed on an underlying drift and the resulting 𝑀𝑆𝐷 reads 𝑀𝑆𝐷𝐷𝐴𝑉 (𝜏) = 𝑀𝑆𝐷𝐷𝐴 (𝜏) +
𝑀𝑆𝐷𝑉 (𝜏). We found that anomalous and confined diffusion appears very similar in experimental data
and therefore decided in favor for anomalous diffusion to describe our data (Supplementary Note 3).
The abbreviations used in this study are summarized in Table 1. As experimental data is usually subject
to noise, a constant offset 𝜊 is added to every model.

Table 1: Overview over possible Mean Squared Displacement models
MSD model selection: The MSD is calculated for every pixel independently, resulting in a space- and
time lag-dependent MSD. It is known that living cells can behave largely heterogeneous[3,60]. Ad-hoc,
it is not known which particle undergoes which kind of diffusion. Fitting a MSD curve with a wrong
model might result in poor fits and highly inaccurate determination of the mentioned parameters. For
this reason, we use a Bayesian inference approach to test different models for any given MSD curve
as proposed by Monnier et al. [21]. Given the data 𝑌 = {𝑌1 , … , 𝑌𝑛 } and 𝐾 model candidates 𝑀 =

{𝑀1 , … , 𝑀𝐾 }, each with its own (multidimensional) parameter set 𝜃 = {𝜃1 , … , 𝜃𝐾 }, we want to find
the model 𝑀𝑘 (𝑌, 𝜃𝑘 ) such that the probability that 𝑀𝑘 (𝑌, 𝜃𝑘 ) describes the data, given the set of
models to test, is maximal. By Bayes’ theorem, the probability for each model is given by

𝑃(𝑀𝑘 |𝑌) =

𝑃(𝑌|𝑀𝑘 )𝑃(𝑀𝑘 )
𝑃(𝑌)

If there is no reason to prefer one model over the other, the prior probability of each model 𝑃(𝑀𝑘 ) is
equal. The parameter set which is used to describe the data, given a fixed model, strongly influences
the probability. Therefore, it is crucial to estimate the optimal parameters for every model in order to
calculate the model probabilities. The probability that the data 𝑌 is observed, given the model 𝑀𝑘
described by the model function 𝑀𝑘 (𝑥; 𝜃𝑘 ) and any parameter set 𝜃𝑘 is approximated by a general
multivariate Gaussian function [61]

𝑃(𝑌|𝜃𝑘 , 𝑀𝑘 ) =

1
√(2𝜋)𝑛 det(𝐶)
1
⋅ exp {− [𝑌 − 𝑀𝑘 (𝑥; 𝜃𝑘 )]𝑇 ⋅ 𝐶 −1 ⋅ [𝑌 − 𝑀𝑘 (𝑥; 𝜃𝑘 )]}
2

where 𝐶 is the empirical covariance matrix of the data and the prefactor is a normalizing factor. This
equation has an intuitive meaning. Assume we test a model 𝑀𝑘 parametrized by 𝜃𝑘 to find out if it
describes the data 𝑌. The exponential function consists of the term [𝑌 − 𝑀𝑘 (𝑥; 𝜃𝑘 )], i.e. the residuals
of the data and the describing model. If the residuals are small, i.e. the model describes the data well,
the exponent is small and the probability 𝑃(𝑌|𝜃𝑘 , 𝑀𝑘 ) seeks 1. On the other hand, the worse the fit,
the greater the resulting residuals and the probability seeks asymptotically to 0. The factor 𝐶 −1
accounts for the covariance in the data. The covariance matrix for a set of MSD curves normally shows
large values for large time lags as the uncertainty increases and MSD curves diverge. The covariance
matrix implicitly introduces a weight to the data, which is small for large variances and large where
the data spreads little. This fact avoids cutting of the MSD curve after a specific number of time lags,
but instead includes all available time lags weighted by the covariance matrix. The approach is
illustrated in (Supplementary Figure 6b) with the covariance matrix exemplary shown in the inset. In

case of uncorrelated errors, non-diagonal elements are zero, but the approach keeps its validity [62]
and follows an ordinary least-squares regression.
Given the best estimate of the parameter set for a model, the model and its corresponding parameters
are chosen so that their probability to describe the data is maximal: 𝜃̂𝑘,𝑀𝐿𝐸 = arg max 𝑃(𝑌|𝜃𝑘 , 𝑀𝑘 ).
𝜃𝑘

It has to be stressed that values of the anomalous exponent scatter around 1, but do not assume the
value 1 (e.g. Figure 1c, middle panel). This is due to the model selection procedure, selecting the
simplest model consisting with the data. In case that the underlying motion is well described by free
diffusion, 𝛼 is inherently set to 1 and classified as free diffusion rather than anomalous diffusion. The
descriptions of free diffusion or anomalous diffusion with 𝛼 = 1 are equivalent, but the free diffusion
model contains one parameter less and is therefore preferred leading to abundance of 𝛼 values close
to 1 in the parameter maps and histograms. To carry out the MSD analysis locally, we choose to take
the 3x3 neighborhood of a pixel, detect possible outliers therein by the interquartile range criterion
[63] and calculate the error covariance matrix of the data within the pixel’s neighborhood. The
restriction to a single pixel and its neighborhood allows us to carry out the MSD analysis of trajectories
locally, in contrast to an ensemble MSD in previous studies [18], revealing only average information
over many trajectories. The choice of a 3x3 window is reasonable with regard to the equivalently
chosen filter size in the Optical Flow estimation. The flow field in this region is therefore assumed to
be sufficiently smooth. All calculations, except for the General Mixture Model analysis, were carried
out using MATLAB (MATLAB Release 2017a, The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, Massachusetts, United
States) on a 64-bit Intel Xeon CPUE5-2609 1.90 GHz workstation with 64 GB RAM and running
Microsoft Windows 10 Professional.

Deconvolution of sub-populations
Regarding especially the distribution of the diffusion constant, an analytical expression can be found
assuming that the diffusion constant was calculated from a freely diffusing particle (𝛼 = 1)[64].
However, we find anomalous diffusion to a large extent in our data (e.g. Figure 2b, d and Figure 4d)
18

and, to our knowledge, an analytical expression cannot be found for distributions of anomalous
exponent, radius of confinement and drift velocity. We therefore aim to deconvolve the parameter
sets in a rather general manner, for which we use a General Mixture model (GMM), a probabilistic
model composed of multiple distributions and corresponding weights. We describe each data point
as a portion of a normal or log-normal distribution described by

𝑓𝑁 (𝑌|𝜇, 𝜎 2 ) =

𝑓𝐿 (𝑌|𝜇, 𝜎

respectively. The logarithmic mean 𝑚 and standard deviation 𝑠 are related to the mean and standard
deviation of the normal distribution via [65].

𝜇 = exp (𝑚 +

𝑠2
)
2
2

𝜎 2 = exp(2𝑚 + 𝑠 2 )(𝑒 𝜎 − 1)
We consider up to three subpopulations to be found in our data and model the total density estimate
as a superposition of one, two or three subpopulations, i.e. the Mixture Model reads

𝑓𝐺𝑀𝑀 (𝑌) = ∑ 𝑤𝑘 𝑓𝑘 (𝑌|𝜇𝑘 , 𝜎𝑘2 )
𝑘

for both normal and log-normal distributions, where to sum goes to 1, 2 or 3. The variable 𝑤𝑘 describes
the weights for each population (or component), which satisfy 0 ≤ 𝑤𝑘 ≤ 1 and sum up to unity. The
weights of each component are directly proportional to the area of the histogram covered by this
component and therefore its existence in the data set.

General Mixture Model analysis
Let 𝑌 = {𝑌1 , … , 𝑌𝑛 } denote 𝑛 data points. For the scope of this description, assume 𝑌 to be a onedimensional variable. Further assume that the data cannot be described by a single distribution, but
by a mixture of distributions. A deconvolution of the data into sub-populations faces the following
problem: Given a label for each data point, denoting the affiliation to a population, one could group

corresponding data points and find the parameters of each population separately using a maximum
likelihood estimation or other methods. On the other hand, if we had given the model parameters for
each population, labels could in principle be inferred from the likelihood of a data point being
described by a population or another. The problem can be formulated by Bayes’ rule (𝑀 indicates
model, 𝐷 indicates data)
𝑃(𝑀|𝐷)𝑃(𝐷) = 𝑃(𝐷|𝑀)𝑃(𝑀).
Here, 𝑃(𝑀|𝐷) is the posterior probability of the model given the data, which is the aim to calculate.
We assign a data point to the component, which maximizes 𝑃(𝑀|𝐷). The probability to observe the
data given a model is described by 𝑃(𝐷|𝑀), i.e. the likelihood function. 𝑃(𝑀) is the prior for the
models to be chosen from. In our case, we have no prior beliefs on the models (all models are equally
likely) such that 𝑃(𝑀) is uniform. Lastly, the probability 𝑃(𝐷) does not depend on the models and can
therefore be dropped.
Unfortunately, neither labels, that is 𝑃(𝑀|𝐷), nor model parameters and weights are known a priori.
The problem can be approached by an Expectation-Maximization (EM) scheme: Without any prior
beliefs about the data distribution, one starts with a simple estimate of model parameters, e.g. a kmeans clustering estimate and iterates subsequently between the two following steps until
convergence:
Expectation step: Calculation of the probability that the component with the current parameter
estimate generated the sample, i.e. 𝑃(𝐷|𝑀).
Maximization step: Update the current parameter estimate for each component by means of a
weighted maximum likelihood estimate, where the weight is the probability that the component
generated the sample.
We illustrate the results of the EM algorithm exemplary in Supplementary Figure 8. From the input
data (Supplementary Figure 8a), represented as histogram, both the likelihood 𝑃(𝐷|𝑀)
(Supplementary Figure 8b) and the posterior (Supplementary Figure 8c) is obtained. The sum of sub20

populations corresponds to the overall probability distribution (shown in black) with different model
parameters and weights found by maximizing the likelihood function. The posterior describes the
probability of data points to fall under each population, i.e. ∑𝑘 𝑃(𝑀𝑘 |𝐷) = 1. The data points are
assigned to those population, for which 𝑃(𝑀𝑘 |𝐷) is maximum, resulting in labeled data. The labels
are subsequently mapped in two dimensions, visualizing spatial correspondence of slow, intermediate
and fast sub-populations (Supplementary Figure 8d). The GMM analysis is carried out using the
pomegranate machine learning package for probabilistic modeling in Python [66].
Selection of subpopulations by the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)
A priori, it is not unambiguously clear from how many populations the data is sampled and which form
the subpopulations take. We therefore assess the suitability of each model by means of the Bayesian
Information Criterion (BIC), which is calculated by[67]
𝐵𝐼𝐶 = −2 ln(𝐿̂) + 𝑝 𝑙𝑛(𝑛),

(3)

where 𝐿̂ is the maximum likelihood of the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) estimate, 𝑝 denotes
the number of parameters in the model and 𝑛 is the number of data points used for the fit. Among a
family of models, the one with the lowest BIC is considered to describe the data best, taking into
account competing complexity of models. A large likelihood of a model favors it to describe the data
well, while on the other hand the model is penalized if many parameters are involved in the model by
the second term in (3). Therefore, the BIC prevents overfitting. In order to judge which model is
appropriate for our data, we tested all considered models for each histogram and assessed the optimal
model by means of the BIC. The fraction of all histograms which described best by one of the six
models considered is given in Table 2. Based on the objective judgement of the fit using the BIC, we
chose for each parameter the model which best describes the largest fraction of histograms (Table 2,
bold cells).

Figure Legends
Figure 1: Hi-D enables spatially resolved mapping of genome dynamic properties at nanoscale
resolution in living cells. Workflow: a) A series of N=150 confocal microscopy images acquired at 5
fps (left) (here SiR DNA stained living U2OS cells). Dense optical flow was applied to define (N-1)
flow fields of the images (center, color coded) based on fluorescence intensity of each pixel (size =
65 nm). Individual trajectories are reconstructed over the duration of acquisition (right). b) MSD
model selection (left): Trajectories of a 3x3 neighborhood of every pixel are used to calculate a mean
MSD curve and its corresponding covariance matrix. By a Bayesian inference approach, the type of
diffusion fitting each individual curve is chosen (free diffusion (D), anomalous diffusion (DA),
directed motion (V) or a combination (DV) or (DAV). The spatial distribution of the selected models
for each pixel is shown as a color map. c) Maps of biophysical parameters (𝐷, 𝛼 and 𝑉) extracted
from the best describing model per pixel reveal local dynamic behavior of DNA in large domains. The
distribution is deconvolved using a General Mixture Model.

Figure 2: Experimental validation of the Hi-D approach. a) Exemplary frame of a simulated time
series with low density (0.001/𝑝𝑥 3) of emitters undergoing Brownian motion convolved by a typical
point spread function (left). The time series is subject to Hi-D and Single Particle Tracking estimating
the trajectories of emitters. From the estimated trajectories, the MSD is computed and compared to
the ground truth diffusion constant. The relative error in the determined diffusion constant is
shown. b) High density (0.02/𝑝𝑥 3 ) of emitters with patches of super-high density (0.035/𝑝𝑥 3 )
encircled for visualization, imitating regions of densely packed chromatin. Dashed lines show the
optimal value, i.e. perfect agreement between estimation and ground truth. Red lines indicate the
median value. Data from 10 independent simulations. Statistical significance assessed by a twosample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (***: p < 0.001). c) MSD curves computed in fixed and living
quiescent (- Serum) and serum stimulated (+ Serum) U2OS cells. Diffusion constants for the three
average curves were derived by regression yielding 𝐷 = (0.87 ± 0.1) ⋅ 10−3 𝜇𝑚2 /𝑠 for quiescent,
𝐷 = (2.6 ± 0.1) ⋅ 10−4 𝜇𝑚2 /𝑠 for stimulated and 𝐷 = (6.1 ± 0.1) ⋅ 10−6 𝜇𝑚2 /𝑠 for fixed cells.
MSD curves show considerably higher MSD values for living cells and diffusion constants are two
orders of magnitude higher for living cells thus confirming the detection of motion well above noise
background. d) Diffusion constants derived from a nucleus corrupted with varying levels of signal-tonoise ratio. Results are consistent up to a lower bound of ~ 20 dB. e) Map of diffusion constants

constant for quiescent (left) and actively transcribing cells (right). c) Relative share of populations on
the cell volume. Numbers in percent. d) For each population in b), the relative share of chosen MSD
models is represented as a stacked histogram in the quiescent state (left bars) and actively transcribing
state (right bars). e) Spatial distribution of populations for the anomalous exponent for quiescent (left)
and actively transcribing cells (right). f) Detailed insight into the spatial patterning of the low
population of the anomalous exponent. The intermediate and high population are shown in light and
dark red respectively.

mapping of the diffusion constant (middle) and population deconvolution (right). b) Violin plots of
the mean diffusion constant of RNA Pol II (n = 19 cells) for all three mobility groups in quiescent (Serum), actively transcribing (+ Serum) and elongation inhibited (+ DRB) cells are shown; dark blue,
light blue and green denote the slow, intermediate and fast population, respectively. c) Relative
share of the populations on the cell volume for starved, stimulated and DRB-treated cells. Numbers
in percent. d) As b) for the diffusion constant and d) the anomalous exponent of DNA dynamics
