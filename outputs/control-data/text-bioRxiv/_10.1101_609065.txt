ABSTRACT

7

Biofilms play an important role in the pathogenesis of Group A Streptococcus (GAS), a gram-positive

8

pathogen responsible for a wide range infections and significant public health impact. Although most

9

GAS serotypes are able to form biofilms, there is large heterogeneity between individual strains in

10

biofilm formation, as measured by standard crystal violet assays. It is generally accepted that biofilm

11

formation includes initial adhesion of bacterial cells to a surface, followed by microcolony formation,

12

biofilm maturation, and extensive production of extracellular matrix that links together proliferating

13

cells and provides a scaffold for the three-dimensional biofilm structure. However, our studies show

14

that for GAS strain JS95, microcolony formation is not an essential step in static biofilm formation,

15

and instead, biofilm can be effectively formed from slow-growing or non-replicating late exponential

16

or early stationary planktonic cells, via sedimentation and fixation of GAS chains into biofilms. In

17

addition, we show that the GAS capsule specifically contributes to the alternative, sedimentation-

18

initiated biofilms. Microcolony-independent, sedimentation biofilms are similar in morphology and

19

3-D structure to biofilms initiated by actively dividing planktonic bacteria. We conclude that GAS can

20

form biofilms by an alternate, non-canonical mechanism that does not require transition from

21

microcolony formation to biofilm maturation, and which may be obscured by biofilm phenotypes

22

that arise via the classical biofilm maturation processes.

23

IMPORTANCE

24

The static biofilm assay is a common tool for easy biomass quantification of biofilm forming bacteria.

25

However, S. pyogenes biofilm formation as measured by the static assay is strain dependent and

26

yields heterogeneous results for different strains of the same serotype. In this study, we show that

27

two independent mechanisms, for which the protective capsule contributes opposing functions, may

28

contribute to static biofilm formation. We propose that separation of these mechanisms for biofilm

29

formation might uncover previously unappreciated biofilm phenotypes that may otherwise be

30

masked in the classic static assay.

INTRODUCTION

34

Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A Streptococcus (GAS)) is a human pathogen responsible for a

35

variety of disease states, ranging from superficial infections such as pharyngitis to severe infections

36

such as necrotizing fasciitis, with a global impact on mortality and morbidity [1]. Biofilm formation is

37

thought to be an important GAS virulence factor, and many GAS strains can form biofilm in vitro [1-

38

3]. Biofilm-like GAS communities have been observed in tonsillar reticulated crypts, suggesting a role

39

for biofilm in asymptomatic GAS carriage [4]. Increased antibiotic tolerance of GAS biofilms has been

40

also proposed as an important reason for antibiotic treatment failure [2, 5]. However, the ability to

41

form biofilm is often strain dependent, and can be heterogeneous even for isolates belonging to the

42

same serotype. Differential regulation of primary adhesin expression, aggregation tendency, or yet

43

unknown alternative mechanisms responsible for biofilm maturation have been proposed to explain

44

this variability [1, 3].

45

Static and flow cell biofilm assays are the two most commonly used methods to study biofilm

46

development in GAS and other organisms. Flow cell biofilm assays have the advantage of biofilm

47

growth in the absence of planktonic cells, in a nutrient-rich and metabolite-poor environment,

48

enabling continuous and detailed observation of biofilm maturation over time. However, flow cell

49

biofilms are labor-intensive to assemble and perform, limiting the variety of conditions that can be

50

screened in a quantitative way [6, 7]. By contrast, biofilm growth under static conditions, typically

51

monitored in 24-well polystyrene plates followed by crystal violet or safranin staining, is a simple,

52

high throughput method to quantify overall biofilm biomass. A drawback of the static biofilm assay is

53

nutrient depletion and metabolite accumulation over time, both of which can affect biofilm

54

maturation [8]. Static biofilm assays are strongly influenced by primary cell to surface interactions,

55

rendering analysis of the entire biofilm life cycle more difficult [8, 9]. Despite these limitations, static

56

biofilm assays remain the major tool for quantitative assessment of GAS biofilm formation [3, 8, 10-

57

15].

58

Several recent studies by us and others have implicated biofilm formation with necrotizing fasciitis

59

(NF) [16-19]. In this study, we sought to dissect the mechanism of biofilm formation of the GAS NF-

60

associated strain JS95. Modifying the commonly used static biofilm assay, we discovered that two

61

parallel mechanisms contribute to GAS biofilm formation: one that proceeds through a classic

62

microcolony proliferation-dependent stage and another that is seeded via proliferation-independent

sedimentation. Capsule has been reported as a GAS biofilm factor, but its precise contribution to

64

biofilm development has been unclear [1, 13]. Using the modified static biofilm assay developed

65

here, we demonstrate opposing contributions of the capsule in each biofilm development

66

mechanism.

RESULTS

68

GAS JS95 biofilm

69

We previously described determinants that are important for necrotizing GAS strain JS95 (M14

70

serotype) biofilm formation in association with host cells and therefore grew GAS in DMEM cell

71

culture medium in that study [17]. Here we used the more commonly used GAS growth medium of

72

Todd-Hewitt broth with 2% yeast extract (THY) supplemented with 0.5% glucose, which was

73

previously demonstrated to improve adherence and biofilm formation [1, 13, 15, 20]. Biofilms were

74

assayed in 24-well polystyrene plates following static incubation at 37°C for 24 hours. Although

75

some GAS strains require additional surface coating (e.g. ploy-L-lysine, collagen, fibronectin,

76

fibrinogen) for GAS attachment and biofilm formation [3, 13], JS95 formed biofilm on polystyrene

77

plates without a need for additional surface treatment. Confocal microscopy showed extensive

78

three-dimensional biofilm structure

79

expected, we also observed a similar biofilm architecture by scanning electron microscopy (SEM)

80

(Figure 1b). Although biofilm matrix-like structures have been observed by SEM in some GAS biofilm

81

studies [3, 21], we did not observe similar structures. An absence of visible EPS matrix in SEM images

82

of GAS biofilms has been previously reported for serotypes M6, M18, M49 [3], whereas matrix-like

83

material has been observed in MGAS5005 biofilms [21]. The heterogeneity in visible biofilm matrix

84

may be due to differences in sample preparation, strains differences, or other experimental

85

variations.

86

extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), has been used as a marker of biofilm matrix for GAS and

87

other organisms [16, 22, 23]; however, WGA staining did not reveal extracellular biofilm matrix for

88

strain JS95 (Figure 1c). We also confirmed that the apparent cell-associated WGA staining is not due

89

to capsule staining by WGA as reported in some studies [16], since the hasA capsule mutant showed

90

an identical staining pattern (Figure S1). Hence, these findings show that GAS strain JS95 forms 3D

91

structures consistent with biofilm architecture described for other GAS strains, but we were unable

92

to visualize extracellular biofilm matrix.

94

Biofilm development is generally thought to initiate by cell adhesion to a surface followed by the

95

formation of microcolonies, extensive extracellular matrix production, and proliferation, together

96

resulting in a mature biofilm structure [1, 9, 24]. Typically, GAS static biofilm assays are conducted by

97

dilution of overnight cultures into fresh growth medium and incubation in 24-well polystyrene plates

98

without agitation for several hours prior to washing and staining for biofilm biomass [8, 13, 16, 20,

99

25-27]. Several GAS adhesins, such as M-protein, collagen-like surface protein, and fibronectin-

100

binding protein are upregulated in early stages of planktonic growth [28], and are thought to be

101

important for static biofilm formation [3]. We therefore examined biofilm formation at different

102

stages of planktonic growth, predicting that biofilms initiated from later stages of planktonic growth

103

would exhibit attenuated biofilm formation, due to reduced adhesin expression [28] and reduced

104

proliferation. To test this hypothesis, we designed a simple planktonic transfer assay, in which the

105

same volume of planktonic GAS culture grown in a conical tube (with occasional agitation to prevent

106

biofilm formation and sedimentation) was transferred into a 24-well plate (1ml/well) at various

107

times throughout the growth curve. Therefore, although fewer cells were transferred at early

108

timepoints, the medium contained nutrients allowing for continued growth and biofilm formation.

109

By contrast, at later timepoints, despite a high number of cells being transferred, the medium lacked

110

nutrients supporting further growth. We measured the optical density (OD600) and determined the

111

CFU at each time point to monitor growth rate and planktonic cell viability prior to transfer. 24-well

112

plates were then incubated for 24 hours and the resulting biofilm biomass was quantified using

113

crystal violet (CV) (Figure 2a). Based on this analysis, biofilms were initiated from planktonic cultures

114

at time points approximately representing the following stages of growth: inoculation (0hrs), early

115

exponential (2hrs), mid exponential (4hrs), late exponential (6hrs), early stationary (8 hrs), and later

116

stationary (10 and 12 hrs). CFU enumeration performed at the time of transfer peaked at 6hrs (2.4 x

117

108 CFU/ml), then decreased to 4 x 107 CFU/ml at the last two time points (10 and 12hrs) (Figure 2b).

118

Surprisingly, biofilm formation ability remained unchanged until later stationary phase (10hrs) when

119

biofilm biomass dropped by 25% compared to earlier time points

120

substantial amount of biofilm biomass was still formed from planktonic culture in early stationary

121

phase (8 hrs) when cellular proliferation is presumably diminishing, and the ability to form biofilm

122

was lost only at 12hrs post infection. We also tested strains MAGAS5005 (serotype M1) and JRS4

123

(serotype M6) and, despite visible differences in biofilm morphology, observed that both exhibited

124

strong biofilm phenotype when transferred at later stages of growth. By contrast, strain HSC5

125

(serotype M14) did not form robust biofilm after late exponential phase transfer (Figure2

126

next investigated the micro-phenotype of biofilms initiated from cultures at each growth phase.

coverage for biofilms initiated from 10 and 12hrs time points. In addition, the overall structure of

129

biofilm initiated from 12 hr stationary phase cultures appeared less homogeneous tended to

130

aggregate

131

(Figure 3a). However, there were no major differences in biofilm structure or GAS chain
organization between these biofilms (Figure 3b). As determined by OD600, CFU and biomass

132

quantification, and imaging, these findings suggest that cell proliferation itself may not be crucial for

133

biofilm formation in this static assay. Finally, we tested whether classic and transferred biofilms

134

differ in antibiotic tolerance, a commonly used hallmark of biofilm [1, 5, 23]. We first determined the

135

minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) for planktonic

136

cultures, and then compared the minimum biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) for GAS JS95

137

biofilm upon exposure to penicillin. We observed that the MBEC of both types of biofilm were

138

similar (differing by one double-dilution of the antibiotic) and far exceeded planktonic MIC and MBC

139

values (Figure S2).

140

Cell proliferation is not necessary for adherent biomass accumulation.

141

To determine whether cellular proliferation was indeed necessary for biofilm biomass accumulation,

142

we treated GAS with the bacteriostatic antibiotic bacitracin. We first confirmed that bacitracin

143

inhibits GAS proliferation at 4ug/ml, as reported previously [29]. Independent of the time of

144

bacitracin addition (3, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, 6.6, 7, 7.5 and 8 hours post inoculation), treatment with

145

4ug/ml bacitracin resulted in an OD600 plateau within approximately 1 hour, with no more than a

146

30% increase in turbidity after the time of treatment (Figure 4a). Therefore, we reasoned that after

147

2 hours of bacitracin treatment, there would be no further proliferation. Hence, we repeated the

148

planktonic transfer assay, growing the planktonic culture for 8hrs (early stationary phase) and adding

149

bacitracin at 4ug/ml for an additional 2hrs of incubation, and then transferring the non-proliferating

150

planktonic cells to 24-well plate for static biofilm assay

151

equally strong biofilm biomass regardless of bacitracin treatment

152

observations suggest that proliferation is not essential for biofilm biomass accumulation, which can

153

arise from cells which are no longer dividing.

154

Planktonic transfer assay uncovers capsule-dependent phenotype differences, masked in classic

156

Cho and Caparon previously showed that a GAS mutant deficient in capsule production was able to

157

form biofilm in static conditions as well as the isogenic parental wild-type strain, but was unable to

158

develop biofilm in flow biofilm conditions [19]. We therefore hypothesized that some of the

159

phenotypic inconsistencies between these assays could be dissected using the planktonic transfer

160

assay established in this study. We performed planktonic transfer assay at 1-hour intervals for a total

(Figure 4b). Crystal violet staining showed

161

of 10 hrs, comparing wild type JS95 and an isogenic hasA mutant deficient for capsule production

162

[17]. (Figure 5a). WT GAS JS95 biofilms inoculated from all growth phases, including early stationary

163

phase, resulted in dense biomass accumulation, as was observed above

164

we observed visually distinct CV staining for early transfer times, whereby the hasA mutant biofilm

165

appeared more robust, although CV quantification did not reveal significant differences

166
167

b). By contrast, the hasA mutant was unable to accumulate biomass when biofilms were initiated
from mid exponential cultures onward (Figure 5a-b). Interestingly, both strains (WT and hasA

168

mutant) were unable to form biofilm in Calgary biofilm device (CBD), in which sedimentation of cells

169

that might contribute to biofilm formation is excluded due to the inverted device geometry

170

S3) [7, 30, 31]. Strong biofilm was, however, observed in P. aeruginosa which served as a positive

171

control [9]. To explore the contribution of adhesins to biofilm formation by each mechanism, we

172

used simple adhesion assay in which planktonic cultures at different growth stages were normalized

173

to the same optical density, incubated in a 24 well plate for 30min in 37C, non-adherent cells

174

removed by washing, and the adherent cells stained using crystal violet. We observed that adhesion

175

of the capsule mutant was similar at all tested growth phases (Figure 5c). Adherence of the wild type

176

strain increased gradually from low levels in early exponential growth, to late stationary phase

177

where it reached the same level as the capsule mutant. We confirmed that, as in other GAS strains,

178

hasA expression peaks at mid-exponential growth, then decreases rapidly (Figure

179

Together with the fact that capsule shedding is associated with cessation of its synthesis [34], these

180

data provide further evidence that the capsule hinders adhesin-mediated surface attachment. In the

181

same adhesion assay we tested JS95 mutant unable to produce M-protein, which is a well-studied

182

GAS virulence factor, also shown to be crucial for biofilm formation [19]. By contrast, a mutant in M-

183

protein, was non-adhesive until the late stationary phase (overnight culture), at when adherence

184

reached approximately half the level of WT at the same growth phase, showing that surface

185

adhesion is not solely dependent on M-protein. Finally, we tested whether exogenous hyaluronidase

186

treatment of WT biofilms could phenocopy hasA biofilms. Indeed, capsule removal by hyaluronidase

187

slightly enhanced classic WT biofilm formation and significantly reduced biofilm formed from

188

cultures transferred at 8hpi

(Figure 2c, d). In addition,

5d) [32, 33].

-

(Figure 5e). At the same time, hyaluronidase presence had little to no

effect on hasA mutant. These data suggest that the capsule contributes differently to biofilms

190

depending on growth stage: it inhibits biofilm formation during early exponential growth by masking

191

surface adhesins, but promotes biofilm formation when it is initiated from later phase cultures.

192

DISCUSSION

In this study we investigated biofilm formation by the clinical GAS strain JS95 (M14 serotype),

194

isolated from an NF patient [18]. We confirmed that it forms biofilm in static conditions, showing

195

dense three-dimensional biofilm structures of chaining cocci characteristic for many of the GAS

196

strains. Although GAS has been shown to produce a biofilm matrix of extracellular polymeric

197

substances (EPS), composed primarily of L-glucose and D-mannose [35], we were unable to observe

198

an extracellular EPS matrix using microscopy for either WT or hasA- stains.

199

Strain-associated differences in GAS biofilm formation have been reported. To address whether

200

strain-independent factors might contribute to biofilm formation, we were motivated to step back

201

and more carefully assess how GAS strain JS95 biofilm is formed using the common static biofilm

202

assay. Using the planktonic transfer assay described here, we observed that GAS cells from

203

planktonic cultures ranging from early exponential phase to early stationary phase can seed robust

204

biofilm formation and biomass accumulation. We only observed reduced biomass accumulation

205

when we seeded biofilms with cells from 12 hr late stationary phase cultures. This phenotype was

206

not strain specific, because GAS strains of different serotypes (JRS4, MGAS5005) displayed a similar

207

ability to form biofilm from late exponential / early stationary planktonic cultures. Moreover,

208

bacitracin inhibition of cell proliferation did not prevent biomass accumulation in these conditions.

209

Together these data suggested the existence of two parallel mechanisms of static biofilm formation.

210

1) In the first, “classic” mechanism, a variety of adhesins including M and M-like proteins facilitate

211

initial surface attachment, followed by microcolony formation, cell proliferation, biofilm matrix

212

production, and biofilm maturation [9, 36]. 2) In an alternative mechanism, planktonically growing

213

cells eventually sediment and attach to the surface, in a process that is enhanced by GAS capsule,

214

leading to biofilm formation

215

seeded from early exponential phase culture (2h post inoculation) showed typical steps of cell

216

attachment to surface (2-3h post transfer), microcolony formation (4-5h post transfer), and dense

217

biofilm formed as early as 6 h post transfer (8h post inoculation). By contrast, cells seeded from late

218

exponential phase culture (6h post inoculation) showed some level of initial surface attachment 2

219

hours post transfer, and a rapid increase of biofilm density at later time points

220

situations led to stable and dense GAS JS95 biofilm formation. Importantly, the second, alternate

221

mechanism for biofilm formation could only be uncovered using the planktonic transfer assay,

222

where sedimentation of later growth phase cultures can promote biofilm biomass accumulation. By

223

contrast, biofilm biomass accumulation in the classic static assay is likely a result of both

224

mechanisms (early attachment and proliferation of microcolonies, as well as sedimentation of later

225

growth phase bacteria). A similar suggestion that sedimented cells could contribute to biofilm

226

biomass led to the development of the Calgary biofilm device (CBD) eliminate the possibility of

227

sedimentation [7, 30, 31]. However, GAS-JS95 did not form biofilms on CBD, further suggesting a

228

strong contribution of the alternate mechanism of GAS biofilm formation.

(Figure 6a). In support of this model, biofilm development from cells

229

Although many studies have demonstrated a strong link between capsule production and GAS

230

virulence, the role for capsule in GAS biofilm formation has been unclear [36-38]. Capsule

231

production is highly regulated during GAS growth, with minimal expression during stationary phase

232

(enabling initial adherence in a classic biofilm model), and peak expression during exponential phase

233

(supporting an alternate, capsule-dependent model for biofilm formation) [32-34], and the same

234

pattern can be observed in JS95 strain. Cleary et al. noted that encapsulated cells grew in a highly

235

aggregated state that can be disrupted by hyaluronidase treatment [39]. These capsule-associated

236

aggregates were originally described as a protective mechanism against oxidative stress, equally

237

consistent with the protective and environmental stress-tolerant state associated with biofilms.

238

Šmitran et al. demonstrated that enzymatic removal of capsule prior to biofilm initiation improved

239

static biofilm formation by most GAS isolates [40], suggesting that the capsule masks biofilm-

240

associated surface adhesins, as has been demonstrated M-protein mediated GAS attachment to

241

keratinocytes [41]. In the context of our revised model for GAS biofilm formation, initial capsule

242

removal would be expected to promote classic biofilm formation, where initial adhesion is essential

243

for biofilm development. Consistent with this, we observed altered early stage biofilm formation

244

whereby the hasA mutant biofilm appeared more robust, although this was not quantifiable by CV

245

staining. The importance of capsule in later stages of biofilm formation has been shown by Cho and

246

Caparon, who demonstrated that a capsule mutant was unaffected in surface adhesion, but was

247

unable to form biofilm in a flow cell [19]. However, both WT and the capsule mutant were fully

248

capable of forming biofilm in the classic static biofilm assay [19]. The ability of the planktonic

249

transfer assay to detect different mechanisms of biofilm initiation enabled us to further dissect the

250

contribution of capsule to biofilm formation. Our finding that capsule mutants are attenuated only

251

for sedimentation-mediated, microcolony-independent static biofilms may suggest that GAS

252

sedimentation characteristics may be important in the maturation of flow cell GAS biofilms.

253

Collectively, these findings suggest that capsule may limit initial surface adherence and promotes

254

sedimentation-mediated biofilm maturation. The ability of the planktonic transfer assay to dissect he

255

contribution of growth stage specific factors may be widely applicable to many other GAS biofilm

256

factors as well.

257

In summary, we showed that different mechanisms contribute to static GAS biofilm formation: 1)

258

classic surface adhesion followed by microcolony formation and biofilm maturation; and 2)

259

sedimentation and attachment of dense planktonic bacteria to a surface followed by biofilm

260

maturation. We showed that capsule may differentially contribute to each of these mechanisms.

261

Separation of these two mechanisms might help to uncover phenotypes otherwise masked in static

biofilm assays, enabling a better understanding of the mechanisms of GAS biofilm formation, and

263

ultimately may inform how biofilm relates to GAS virulence.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

265

Bacterial culture, planktonic transfer assay, and biofilm assay: GAS strain JS95, an M14 serotype

266

isolate from a NF patient [18], or a hasA mutant in the JS95 background, as well as strain JRS4 (M6

267

serotype), HSC5 (M14 serotype) and MGAS5005 (M1 serotype), were grown at 37⁰C overnight

268

(16hrs) in Todd-Hewitt liquid medium (Sigma Aldrich) supplemented with 0.2% yeast extract

269

(Becton, Dickinson) (THY) prior to all assays. Overnight cultures were inoculated 1:100 into fresh THY

270

medium supplemented with 0.5% glucose in a 50ml tube, and incubated at 37⁰C, with 5% CO2 and a

271

loose tube cap. Cultures were mixed by inverting the tube three times at 30 min intervals to prevent

272

sedimentation. At the desired time points, 1 or 3 ml of planktonic culture was transferred into a well

273

of a 24 well (for crystal violet staining) or 6 well (for SEM) polystyrene plate (Corning, New York,

274

USA), respectively. For confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), 3ml of culture was transferred to

275

a 35mm Ibidi imaging dish (Ibidi, Munich, Germany), which allow high resolution CLSM imaging.

Although some differences between substrates might influence biofilm formation, we did not

277

observe a significant impact on biofilm formation between polystyrene and the Ibidi surface. Plates

278

or Ibidi dishes were then incubated without agitation for 24 hrs at 37⁰C with 5% CO2. At the time of

279

transfer optical density at 600nm was measured in a 1cm cuvette by UVmini-1240 UV-Vis

280

spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan) and bacterial viability was quantified by serial colony forming

281

unit (CFU) enumeration. Prior to CFU plating, cultures were centrifuged for 2 min at 15,000 rcf using

282

a table top Eppendorf 5424 centrifuge (Eppendorf, Germany) to disrupt chains (confirmed by bright

283

field microscopy). To inhibit bacterial proliferation, bacitracin (Sigma Aldrich) was added at 4 µg/ml

284

for the times indicated.

285

Biofilm quantification: After 24 hrs of growth, non-adherent cells were washed gently with PBS.

286

Biofilms were stained with 0.1% crystal violet (CV) for 15min, and the excess CV was removed by a

287

subsequent PBS wash. Stained biofilms were first imaged using a Huawei Mate 20 Pro camera

288

(Huawei, China) and dissolved in 96% ethanol. Prior to OD measurement, samples were diluted to

289

ensure a linear reading range. Absorbance was measured at 590nm using Tecan M200

290

spectrophotometer (Tecan AG, Männedorf, Switzerland).

291

MIC, MBC and MBEC assay: Standard protocols with slight modifications were used to determine

292

the MIC, MBC and MBEC values [42, 43]. Briefly, to determine the MIC, subcultures (inoculated

293

1:100) were grown overnight in a 96well plate in THY with serially diluted antibiotic. Turbidity was

294

assessed using a plate reader (Tecan AG, Männedorf, Switzerland) at 600nm to determine the

295

minimal antibiotic concentration that inhibited bacterial growth. Cultures were then subcultured

296

onto THY agar plates to determine the MBC. To determine the MBEC, biofilms were prepared by

297

inoculating THY + 0.5% glucose 1:100 from an overnight culture and transferring (1ml/well) to 24-

298

well plate (referred in text as “classic” biofilm) or incubating inoculated medium in 50ml conical tube

299

for 8 hours (until early stationary phase) and inverting occasionally (to maintain cells in a planktonic

300

state), followed by transfer to 24-well plate (referred in text as “transferred” biofilm”). Both types of

301

biofilm were incubated 16 hours post inoculation, then washed gently 2 times with PBS, exposed to

302

THY containing various concentration of penicillin, incubated 1hr, washed again 2 times with PBS,

303

and incubated overnight in fresh THY. Turbidity was then measured using a plate reader at 600nm

304

and the lowest concentration of antibiotic giving no turbidity was defined as MBEC. All incubations

305

were at 37°C.

306

Hyaluronidase treatment: “Classic” and “transferred” biofilms were prepared as described for the

307

MBEC assay, except both types of biofilms were incubated for 24 hours in 37°C and inoculated 1:100

308

medium was supplemented with 50µg/ml hyaluronidase (cat#H3506, Sigma-Aldrich). Following

309

incubation, biofilm was quantified as described above.

310

Surface adhesion: Fresh THY + 0.5% glucose was inoculated 1:100 with an overnight culture grown

311

in THY and incubated at 37°C in a conical tube until the desired growth phase was reached: early

312

exponential (OD600 = 0.2), late exponential (OD600 = 0.8), early stationary (OD600 reaching plateau,

313

around 8h), late stationary (16h). Cultures were then spun for 10min at 8000rcf, resuspended and

314

normalized to OD600 = 1.0 in PBS, transferred to 24-well plate (1ml/well), incubated for 30min at

315

37°C, washed twice with PBS, then stained with 0.1% crystal violet for 10min and washed again with

316

PBS. Crystal violet was then solubilized in 96% ethanol and quantified at 590nm using a Tecan M200

317

spectrophotometer (Tecan AG, Männedorf, Switzerland).

318

RNA extraction and RT-qPCR: Bacteria grown in THY + 0.5% glucose were harvested by

319

centrifugation for 1min at 10,000rcf at various growth stages: early exponential (OD600 = 0.2), mid

320

exponential (OD600 = 0.5), late exponential (OD600 = 0.8), early stationary (OD600 reaching plateau,

321

around 8h), late stationary (16h). RNA was isolated using Direct-zol RNA MiniPrep (Zymo Research,

322

USA), and DNAse treated with Turbo DNA-free kit (Ambion, USA). RNA concentration and DNA

323

absece was assessed by Qubit 2.0 (Invitrogen, USA) and the integrity was determined by Tape

324

Station (Agilent Technologies, USA). Samples with RIN > 7 and DNA contamination <10% were used

325

for cDNA synthesis using SuperScript III first-strand synthesis kit (Invitrogen). RT-qPCR was

326

performed using 2xSYBR FAST qPCR universal MasterMix kit (Kappa Biosystems, USA). Gyrase A

327

(gyrA) was used as an endogenous control [44]. The following primers were used (5’ > 3’): hasA:

Confocal laser scanning microscopy: Biofilm in 35mm a Ibidi dish was washed gently in PBS (twice),

331

then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10min, washed again with PBS, and stained with the

332

indicated dyes according to manufactrer protocol and washed again with PBS. Matrix staining was

333

performed using WGA-AF633 at 50 µg/ml. Hoechst33342 and Syto9 were used to stain DNA of all

334

cells. Propidium iodide was used to stain DNA of membrane-compromised cells, as it cannot cross

335

the membrane of live cells. For live-dead staining, cells were not fixed with paraformaldehyde.

336

Microscopy was performed using a Zeiss LSM780 confocal microscope, equipped with 20x NA0.80,

337

63x NA1.40 (oil) or 100x NA1.46 (oil) lens. Collected Z-stacks were projected as volume or maximum

338

projection using FIJI distribution of ImageJ (NIH, Maryland, USA).

339

Scanning Electron Microscopy: Biofilms in 6 well plates were washed 3x with 0.1M PB, fixed

340

overnight in 4°C with 2.5% glutaraldehyde (Agar Scientific), post fixed with 1% OsO4, dehydrated in

341

an ethanol gradient, and finally dried using HMDS (Sigma Aldrich). After platinum coating, samples

342

were imaged using Jeol 7610F instrument (Jeol, USA).

Figure 6. Model for static GAS biofilm formation. (a) In the classic mechanism for biofilm formation,

surface attachment is followed by microcolony formation, cell proliferation, EPS production, and
biofilm maturation. In the alternate pathway for biofilm formation, planktonic cells sediment when
they reach a critical cell density, attach to a surface, and become fixed into biofilm structure. Both
mechanisms are likely occur in the widely used static biofilm assay. (b) Time course showing biofilm
development from culture transferred at early and late exponential phases. Images of biofilm
developing from early exponential culture show typical steps of initial attachment (2-3h of static
incubation), microcolony formation (4-5h) and stable biofilm (6h). Despite higher cell density,
transfer of late exponential phase cells result in moderate initial attachment (2h of static incubation)
followed by rapid increase biofilm formation a later time points, supporting the proposed alternate
sedimentation mechanism of biofilm initiation. CLSM images of Syto9 stained biofilms are rendered
as volume projection.
